Category: Bathing your Bird
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bathing with water allows birds to have healthy feathers and skin. Wild birds use rainfall, a puddle, lakes, or wet vegetation. Most birds, domestic or wild, spend a lot of time taking care of their feathers. That time is not only normal, but also important. It's easier to loosen dirt on wet feathers and make feathers easier to preen. Birds preen when they arrange their feathers and in doing so spread oil from the preen gland so the feathers remain waterproof and keep them warm by trapping air. Well preened and maintained feathers are also important for aerodynamic efficiency and effective social communication. New feathers come in, generally speaking, once a year. During that year, the bird needs to keep them in good shape. Many things adversely affect their feathers, such as mites, bacteria and gradual wear so that eventually the feathers are a bit frayed.  Keeping good care of feathers likely helps birds fly better. Most indoor birds enjoy a simple bath, and once you have put everything they need into place, they do all the work while you get to watch your bird enjoy themselves. Watching them take a dip is truly entertaining, hence the popularity of bird baths in yards. Many birds like being misted with a water bottle, while some dislike it. How often a bird should be bathed comes down to the bird’s preference, not yours. It’s helpful to offer a bath once a week, but some birds will like it more often or less than that. Trial and error is the best method to find out what each particular bird prefers. Bathing in Water You can encourage your bird to bathe by offering a shallow dish inside the cage or while out socializing with you. You might also try showering with your bird, as there are commercially available perches for the shower. (Be sure to clean up any bird poop left in the tub or enclosure.) Some birds prefer to bathe under running water, such as in a sink under a faucet. Misting Watch your bird’s body language for signals that they do not like being misted. Body language will vary based on the species and individual parrot, but if you notice any attempts to escape or avoid the spray bottle, or growling/vocalizing, please do not force your bird to be misted. There are several other methods of bathing that will promote preening and you bird might enjoy. Mist your bird lightly in a manner and schedule that is accepted by your bird, and that adds to its daily life and activities. Misting is supposed to be a good thing, not a bad thing! A light misting merely implies superficial dampening of the feathers enough to guide the bird towards more normal preening activity for a short time period. If your bird is ill, fearful, or has other medical concerns, misting may not be appropriate. Misting can be combined with time that is shared with your bird out on a training perch. This combines social interaction with feather care, and the combination of these two categories can enhance the lifestyle and welfare of your parrot. The goal is enrichment, welfare and happiness. Over the Counter Products Many products are marketed to enhance the appearance of your bird’s feathers or to stop feather-damaging behaviors. Some of these products have ingredients that are far from natural, and some are realistically appropriate for mammals only. Overall, most of these products will not help, do not teach or enrich alternative activities and behaviors, and some can actually cause harm. In general, we recommend water as your misting agent, and the money that you save by not purchasing some of these commercially offered sprays can be better applied toward toys or other environmental enriching products. Outdoor Bird Baths If you keep a bird bath for wildlife, it needs to provide clean water. That means you will need to clean it. Algae is the most common problem. If you see algae, empty the bath. Mix three parts water to one part vinegar and spray it on the algae. This mixture will not harm nearby plants. OR:  one part distilled white vinegar to nine parts water. If necessary, use a wire brush to scrub debris. If bleach is needed, it should be diluted at about one cup per gallon and used for scrubbing and cleaning. Afterwards, the surfaces should be rinsed well, and allowed to fully air dry before being used.

Category: Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is PBFD? BFD stands for psittacine (pronounced sidəsīn) beak and feather disease. This viral condition of birds is responsible for damage to the beak, feathers and nails as well as the immune system of infected birds. Which Bird Species are Affected by PBFD? PBFD affects both pet and wild parrots. The virus is found most frequently among cockatoos, African grey parrots, lovebirds, Lories and lorikeets, Eclectus parrots and budgerigars. What Are The Symptoms? As mentioned above and implied by the name, PBFD typically affects the feathers of infected birds; over time the beak and nails may also become affected. These classic symptoms are often first seen in African grey parrots and cockatoos between 6 months and 3 years of age. Birds may first lose their powder down (the white, fine powder produced by specialized feathers to help maintain feather health). This is typically noticed by a beak that has become glossy rather than the more typical matte appearance that is caused by powder down. More abnormal feathers will then develop progressively. These feathers are short, fragile, malformed, and prone to bleeding and breaking. Over time there will be a significant loss of feathers as the follicles become damaged. Some birds may survive for many months with this condition, but over time the beak and nails may become brittle and malformed. This condition is painful for the bird and also allows secondary infections to take hold.  While an avian veterinarian may be able to make sick birds more comfortable and treat many of these secondary infections, the vast majority of birds will ultimately die from this disease. Young birds, particularly African grey parrots, may become sick and even die before feather changes occur. Often these birds are less than 7 months of age. These birds will lose their appetite, only be able to slowly empty the crop and gastrointestinal tract, and may regurgitate.  Many of these birds will die of the acute form. Young cockatoos can also develop this acute form. In addition to the non-specific symptoms observed in grey parrots, feather changes are more likely to occur in sick young cockatoos. I’ve Heard Lovebirds And Budgerigars (Parakeets) Are Affected Differently. Is That True? It appears that budgerigars are also infected relatively commonly. They develop rather unique symptoms in that they tend to lose their major wing and tail feathers rather than feathers all over the body, which is the case in cockatoos and African grey parrots.Yes, that’s true. Many lovebirds are infected with PBFD virus; however few of them ever show any signs of being ill. Some lovebirds may be infected and shed the virus transiently while never showing any feather abnormalities or signs of ill health. Others, typically young adults, may show feather changes and appear unkempt. Some of these birds will die from the condition while others may survive months to years or go on to recover fully. It is important to be aware of the relatively high rate of infection among lovebirds and budgerigars, especially if you are considering introducing these birds into a house with more susceptible birds such as cockatoos and African grey parrots. As such, testing for the disease is strongly recommended when these birds are to be introduced into a house with susceptible parrots. How Is PBFD Diagnosed? Sometimes your veterinarian will have a strong suspicion that your bird has PBFD based upon appearance, age and species. However, it is quite likely that your veterinarian will also suggest performing a PCR test to confirm the diagnosis. This test uses advanced techniques to look for the virus’ DNA. Typically the test looks for the virus in blood, but your veterinarian may chose to take a swab from your bird’s mouth and vent. As mentioned above, your veterinarian may also suggest testing new birds, even if there are no signs of disease. This may be done to protect other birds in your house, or to increase your awareness that your new pet may be carrying this potentially serious and life-threatening virus. If your bird is a susceptible species, young and sick with non-specific signs, your veterinarian will likely suggest performing baseline tests such as a complete blood count and a chemistry panel. These tests may then strengthen the suspicion of PBFD and your veterinarian may then suggest performing the specific DNA test for PBFD. In any case, a positive test should be rechecked 90 days later as there are instances in which birds — even those of highly susceptible species — can be transiently infected and clear the infection without ill health. This is important to keep in mind as a single positive test should be taken seriously but not as a certainty of severe disease and death. Can You Treat PBFD? Unfortunately there are no antiviral drugs available to fight the virus. Your avian veterinarian can help keep your bird comfortable and fight secondary infections for variable periods of time. Sadly, however, the majority of clinically affected birds will die within a few months to a year. Is There A Vaccine To Prevent PBFD? Despite extensive research, there is still no commercially available PBFD vaccine. How Can PBFD Be Prevented? Great steps have been taken to reduce the prevalence of PBFD in the USA. This condition used to be far more common prior to the ban on importing foreign parrots in 1994. Since that time, many American breeders have taken pro-active steps to reduce and eliminate this virus from their flocks and subsequently from the pet bird market. Unfortunately not all breeders have taken these steps and even if one breeder has, birds may be commingled with birds from other breeds as they travel from wholesaler to retail pet distributors and their new home. As such the best thing you can do is have your bird examined by an avian veterinarian and allow diagnostic testing for this and other diseases that your bird could have been exposed to. In addition to testing new birds, it is also wise to institute a strict quarantine of new additions for up to two months to help ensure they are free of disease before introducing them to other birds in your household.

Category: AAFCO Pet Food Labeling
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pet food marketing can get confusing. The labeling does not provide detailed nutritional information and it’s easily misunderstood by consumers. Try as you might, sometimes reading the label doesn’t give you enough answers. However, the more you know about what pet food labels indicate – and don’t – the better off your pet will be. What is AAFCO? AAFCOis the go-to organization for understanding animal feed, including food for pets. It does not regulate or inspect anything, nor is it a government agency. It is a group whose members are government agencies representing the 50 states, Canada, and the federal government. It is not a regulatory body and has no ability to monitor or enforce specific food manufacturing procedures. Animal feed specialists indicate to them what is appropriate for a specific species, and AAFCO provides model feed laws. AAFCO does not approve or certify any pet food, treat, or supplement products. The FDA, not AAFCO, regulates pet food, and FDA is a member of AAFCO. State feed control officials can choose to adopt these model feed laws – if they do, then monitoring and enforcement duties are the responsibility of the individual state. Pet food manufacturers that sell food must comply with all relevant federal or state laws. Most pet foods sold in multiple states will comply with the AAFCO guidelines. AAFCO relies on current scientific knowledge to provide guidelines for pet food composition which, if followed,minimize the risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, the FDA enforces food safety through the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, which demands that pet foods, like human foods, be “pure and wholesome, safe to eat, produced under sanitary conditions, contain no harmful substances, and be truthfully labeled.” Therefore, pet food manufacturers are legally responsible for providing nutritionally adequate, safe, and wholesome products that conform to local, state, and federal law. AAFCO requires nine components to be printed on a pet food label:  What are the different AAFCO nutritional adequacy designations for pet foods? There are four possible AAFCO nutritional adequacy statements that can appear on pet food labels. These must be printed verbatim as one of the following: How are AAFCO feeding trials conducted? The guidelines for an AAFCO feeding trial vary depending on the diet type being evaluated. There are four protocols: maintenance, growth, gestation/lactation, and all life stages. Although the minimum standards for each type of trial must be met, companies may add on other components to a feeding trial, such as plasma amino acid measurement, digestibility studies, full blood chemistry panels, and complete blood counts to gain additional information about the suitability of their diets for the life stage being tested. Foods can be put through AAFCO feeding trials even if they do not qualify for a “formulated to meet AAFCO” feeding statement due to deficient or excessive levels of nutrients. One example is veterinary therapeutic diets formulated for chronic kidney disease, which are intentionally formulated to contain phosphorus (+/- protein) at concentrations below the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles for adult maintenance; many of these have passed maintenance feeding trials and thus have a “feeding trial” nutritional adequacy statement on the bag. If they have not undergone feeding trials, they must carry the statement: “This product is intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.” Such diets are not allowed to reference the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles on the label. Theoretically, the flip side is that diets that fail feeding trials but contain nutrient levels within the specified minimum and maximum concentrations per AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles can be marketed with a “formulated to meet” adequacy statement. Ideally, diets are formulated to comply with the concentrations specified by the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles and then pass appropriate feeding trials. Foradult maintenance canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Forgrowth canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Forreproduction canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Do AAFCO feeding trials accomplish what they claim to accomplish? Many pet owners and clinicians have raised the concern that AAFCO feeding trials do not represent what really happens in a pet’s life, i.e., that feeding a diet for six months is not the same as feeding a diet for 10 years. That is true. However, although AAFCO trials are imperfect, they do identify most serious acute and semi-acute nutritional deficiencies or excesses, and some minor ones. Furthermore, manufacturers are free to supplement the minimum protocol requirements with additional measures of nutritional adequacy. Also, consider that diets for growth, gestation/lactation, or all life stages get tested more rigorously compared to maintenance since the nutritional demands of those animals are greater. Evaluation of diets under AAFCO guidelines also includes an examination of the nutrient content of the diet being tested. The nutrient content can be determined either by testing a sample of the finished diet or by using the nutrient content of the individual ingredients in the food to calculate the diet composition. The latter is less desirable, since ingredients are naturally variable in nutrient content and because processing and nutrient interactions could alter bioavailability (how much can actually be absorbed and used by your pet's body) in the final diet. There is no requirement for either in vivo or laboratory testing of pet food products if the formulation method of substantiating nutritional adequacy is used. Some companies have performed other in vivo testing (in-vivo meaning taking place within a living thing) and even lifelong feeding trials to demonstrate that their diets provide complete and balanced nutrition for the expected feeding duration (i.e., “for life”). How can you identify the pet foods that have undergone “more rigorous” testing of their pet food, rather than just the AAFCO statement on the bag? Unfortunately, you can't. Even veterinarians can’t. The pet food label is really a legal document and is not designed to convey significant nutritional information. As much as some sources (such as internet ranking lists) would like it to be possible, you cannot evaluate 'quality' from the label, especially from ingredient lists. You need to consider the manufacturer (reputation, experience, investment in AAFCO trials and research, etc.), cost, availability, and how your pets are doing on various diets. Board-certified veterinary nutritionists in clinical practice are alerted to dietary issues with specific diets because of extensive interaction with clients, practitioners, and each other. Therefore, these specialists are often a reliable resource for determining which diets are causing disease problems. In addition, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Nutrition Toolkit developed by the WSAVA Global Nutrition Committee provides many useful nutrition resources includingRecommendations on Selecting Pet Foods. This document lists eight questions to help owners assess pet foods: Factors to consider about a brand: Things to look for on a pet food label: It is ideal for a manufacturer to have a qualified nutritionist as a full-time employee rather than just as a consultant. Dr. Cailin Heinze, a board-certified nutritionist, additionally prefers companies that perform testing above and beyond AAFCO trials, especially with veterinary therapeutic diets. Furthermore, Dr. Heinze looks for company longevity as a sign of a successful track record and is critical of “guerrilla marketing” in pet supply stores (aggressive, emotion-based strategies directly to consumers). Finally, she looks for companies willing to share full nutritional profiles (e.g. full or typical analysis) of their diets rather than just a guaranteed analysis, and provide updated information with regular batch testing. Understanding what’s best for your pet isn’t always easy. Oftentimes the only way to get a clear answer to your question is to telephone (not email) the manufacturer. However, the best chance for your pet’s good health is to begin with food bearing an AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement on its label.

Category: Avian Gastric Yeast
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Avian gastric yeast infection is a bird disease caused by a yeast,Macrorhabdus sp,that causes gastrointestinal problems. It is highly contagious and affects a variety of birds. An older name for it is megabacteria because of its size. The organism infects the bird’s stomach, and the infection destroys the ability of the bird’s stomach to properly digest and absorb nutrients from food. Avian Stomach Anatomy The avian stomach is quite unlike the human one and has two parts with a connector. The proventriculus digests food; the isthmus moves food between the proventriculus and the gizzard; and the gizzard grinds food for easier digestion. Food moves back and forth between the proventriculus and gizzard until it is fully digested and the nutrients are absorbed. Who gets Avian Gastric Yeast? This disease occurs in a wide range of birds, such as chickens, partridges, ostriches, turkeys, parrots, finches, and budgerigars. Being infected with avian gastric yeast does not always result in infection and subsequent disease. Signs Signs of avian gastric yeast infection and disease are nonspecific and can take on two forms:  acute and chronic. Diagnosis As avian gastric yeast is transmitted through the fecal to oral route, fresh fecal samples are used as a quick diagnostic tool. Fecal testsare not highly accurate as the organism is shed sporadically in droppings. A negative test does not rule out infection. Histology, a sample of the tissue, is the only definitive test for avian gastric yeast infection. An isthmus tissue sample is usually done after death because of the complication and risk of a surgical procedure. Treatment Treatment outcome varies depending on the severity of the clinical signs the bird is experiencing. Prevention There is no vaccine to prevent avian gastric yeast. The only way to prevent the infection from spreading is clearing it from your flock. Quarantine all new birds for 30 days before introducing them to the flock. A veterinary exam is a necessity for all new birds.

Category: Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD) in Birds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is it? Proventricular dilatation disease is an inflammatory disease affecting the gastrointestinal and neurological systems in a variety of bird species. PDD is incurable, but manageable. Consequences of PDD range from gastrointestinal problems causing an increase in the size of the bird’s stomach to neurological symptoms. The disease is caused by avian bornavirus, which targets the bird’s nervous system. The damaged nervous system does not allow nutrients to be digested or absorbed. The virus does not always cause the disease, so a bird can have bornavirus and never develop PDD. Research on the virus and disease is still ongoing with much to be discovered. Who gets it? These are only some of the affected species, but more than 50 different parrot species can be affected. How is it spread? What are the signs? The signs can happen quickly or take time to develop. However, all the symptoms are general and are not specific to PDD. How is it diagnosed? The symptoms of PDD are not specific and there are a variety of potential causes explaining the bird’s illness such as lead toxicity, fungal or bacterial infection, or parasites. Therefore, other potential causes must be ruled out first before a diagnosis of PDD can be made. A physical examination by your veterinarian is first so a professional can see the clinical signs. Tests may include bloodwork, such as complete blood count or serology, radiographs to look for an enlarged stomach, a stomach biopsy to detect infected tissue and nerves, and other laboratory tests, such as PCR. How is it treated? There is no cure for PDD, so treatment reduces inflammation and the other symptoms. How do you prevent it? Infected birds should be isolated for life to prevent the virus spreading to other pet birds. New birds should be isolated and tested for the virus before they are introduced to the flock. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine to protect birds from avian bornavirus.

Category: Aspergillosis in Birds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Aspergillosis? Immune suppression (possibly due to concurrent diseases), stress, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency (common with all-seed diets), confinement, and prolonged antibiotic use are all possible reasons for the development of opportunisticAspergillusinfections. Additionally, poor housing, hygiene and husbandry practices may predispose pet and aviary birds to develop this disease. Damp bedding and food, long-term food storage, humidity, poor ventilation, and inadequate cage cleaning are all factors that can increase the amount of fungal spores that are inhaled from the environment. Some kinds of bedding such as corn cob and walnut shells may also favor the growth ofAspergillus. Even in healthy individuals, inhalation or ingestion of abnormally large numbers of spores can cause severe disease. Less frequent routes of exposure include through skin lacerations or infections, or through eggshell contamination during incubation. All pet birds can develop disease, but the most commonly affected pet species are the African gray, Amazon and pionus parrots.Aspergillosis is considered one of, if not the most common, causes of respiratory disease in pet birds. It is caused by infection with a fungus of the genusAspergillus. The species of this organism that most frequently causes respiratory disease in pet birds isAspergillus fumigatus. This organism is found commonly in the natural environment and in fact may be found in the respiratory tract of many healthy wild and pet birds.Aspergillusmakes its way into the lungs and air sacs of birds when fungal spores are inhaled from the environment. This does not normally cause a problem in fit, healthy birds, but several underlying problems and/or a massive exposure to these spores may predispose a bird to the development of aspergillosis. What are the Signs of Aspergillosis? Aspergillosis usually develops gradually within the lungs and air sacs (thin extensions of the avian lungs). Early signs are often subtle, including reduced energy levels, decreased appetite, lethargy, progressive weight loss, or exercise intolerance (easily out of breath). This chronic form usually is a result of long-term stress or illness and often goes on undetected for some time. Respiratory signs, such as increased respiratory rate and effort, open-mouthed breathing and respiratory noises are signs of increasing severity and are not normally detected until late in the development of disease. Respiratory distress can be an emergency in birds and can lead to rapid deterioration or sudden death. If you see these signs, alert your veterinarian as soon as possible. Acute aspergillosis is less common and is typically seen in young, immune compromised animals that are exposed to large numbers ofAspergillusspores. This form of the disease may include any of the above signs, but progresses much more rapidly, possibly leading to death within days.Aspergillusinfection may also be present in the trachea (windpipe), causing a voice change or a gurgling cough; or nasal cavity, causing facial swelling or nasal discharge. Although aspergillosis is primarily a respiratory disease, it can affect any organ of the body by traveling through the bloodstream or by growing through an air sac into the body cavity. Because of this, there are a large number of less common signs that may be seen. Gastrointestinal signs, such as diarrhea and regurgitation or neurological signs including tremors, incoordination and generalized weakness have also been reported. Some birds go to the veterinarian with a wing droop secondary to damage to air sacs near the shoulder. How is Aspergillosis Diagnosed? Diagnosis of aspergillosis can be difficult and usually involves the use of several different tests. Clinical signs and physical exam findings, as well as changes on routine blood work may be suggestive of a problem, but are non-specific and not sufficient on their own for a definitive diagnosis to be reached. A history of a stressful event may also key a veterinarian into the development of aspergillosis. Radiographs are the next most common test and may show signs of changes in the lungs, air sacs, or other parts of the body. Something that may be even more useful for visualizing fungal infection in birds is endoscopy, which can be used to directly observe the airways. All of these diagnostic methods can support a diagnosis of aspergillosis, but the disease cannot be definitively diagnosed without actually identifying the organism. Currently, the best method for arriving at a diagnosis of aspergillosis appears to be use of the above tests combined with a fungal culture of the respiratory tract. Birds with a positive culture forAspergillusare more likely to have a significant amount of fungal growth. Cultures are, however, not incredibly sensitive and some infections may not be detected. Additionally, your veterinarian may directly observe secretions flushed from the airway or obtained during a procedure known as endoscopy to look for fungal organisms. Recently, other tests have been developed that attempt to identify antibodies or Aspergillus organisms in the blood. These tests can be more effective at detecting Aspergillus in the body, but they are so sensitive that many animals testing positive may not actually have the disease. There are also a significant number of affected birds that test negative using these methods. Your avian veterinarian may well suggest running these tests to provide additional data, but they are unlikely on their own to provide a definitive diagnosis. Ultimately, the best way to definitively diagnose aspergillosis is to have a pathologist observe affected tissue under a microscope. Biopsies can be taken under anesthesia, typically via endoscopy, and sent to a laboratory to be analyzed. A positive result of this test is the best possible way to be certain of a diagnosis of aspergillosis, but it is not without its limitations. Placing a debilitated bird under anesthesia can be a dangerous procedure and taking a biopsy may lead to hemorrhage or other life-threatening complications. Additionally, there is a chance that the affected tissue may be missed when the biopsy is taken. Therefore, it is not normally used as the first test. However, if your avian veterinarian suggests this procedure it is because he believes it is in your bird's best interest. This procedure may also allow for direct treatment of the fungus within the air sacs with a powerful antifungal agent. Can Aspergillosis be Treated? Yes.  Aspergillosis can be treated with a combination of anti-fungal medication and supportive care with variable success depending on the severity and extent of disease. When considering prognosis it should be kept in mind that by the time many birds show clinical signs they likely have been sick for several weeks. Anti-fungal medication is the first line of defense against aspergillosis, and of these medications,itraconazoleis probably the most widely accepted anti-fungal drug. This medication is given by mouth and is relatively safe for use in birds. Another anti-fungal, amphotericin B, has been commonly used as a primary treatment for aspergillosis in birds when they are hospitalized, but it has been known to cause toxicity, damaging the kidneys when used for long periods. Another use for this drug is that it may be administered topically to an area of fungal growth during the endoscopic procedure, as mentioned above. There are many other anti-fungal medications that are used less frequently with varying success. Nebulization (aerosolization) of certain drugs may also be a reasonable way to treat fungal infection by allowing the drug to gain access to the airways. Anti-fungal therapy may need to be continued for at least 6 weeks and in some cases as long as 6 months in order to be fully effective. In serious cases, surgical intervention may be necessary. Aspergillus can form granulomas (masses of fungi combined with inflammatory cells) within the airways or other parts of the body. If a granuloma forms within the trachea, it can block air flow. If this happens, the animal may need to be anesthetized so that the mass can be removed. If an airway cannot be established, veterinarians will often place an air-sac cannula (a tube leading into an air sac through the body wall) so that the bird can breathe. In many respects this is similar to the placement of a tracheostomy tube as performed in people and other mammals in emergency settings.  Anesthesia of a bird with respiratory problems does carry its risks but it may be necessary if the bird cannot breathe effectively. Aside from treating the disease itself, efforts must also be made to ensure that the bird is otherwise stable. Because of this, supportive care is an important part of treatment. Some birds may need supplemental nutrition if they are not eating. Other problems such as dehydration or hypothermia may also need to be addressed.  Lastly, it is extremely important to remember that development of aspergillosis is often an indication of an underlying disease or husbandry problem. The cause of immune suppression must be addressed in order to increase the likelihood that your bird will return to health. What is the Prognosis for a Bird Affected byAspergillus? The prognosis for aspergillosis varies significantly depending on the severity of the disease and when it is detected. With the dedicated care of an experienced avian veterinarian and with several days of hospitalization, a case that is diagnosed early may carry a fairly good to excellent prognosis. Unfortunately, by the time more obvious clinical signs such as respiratory effort are detected, the disease has progressed significantly.  Aspergillosis is a serious disease and as it becomes more severe, prognosis becomes progressively worse, especially in birds that have significant immune compromise. What is the Best Way to Protect against Aspergillosis? BecauseAspergillusis such a common inhabitant of the normal respiratory tract, it is impossible to entirely eliminate it. Vaccines do exist, but their effectiveness is questionable. The best prevention is based on limiting exposure to spores and keeping your bird healthy overall. Make sure your bird is in a clean environment that is not too humid or crowded. Do not leave moist bedding or food in the cage for long periods of time as these are ideal sites for fungal proliferation. Most importantly, make sure your bird is healthy and happy. Limit stress as much as possible and try to maintain routine veterinary care for your bird so that any problems that may predispose to more serious disease are detected early. Can Aspergillosis be Transmitted to Humans? Aspergillosis is not considered to be a contagious disease and a healthy person does not need to worry about becoming infected.Aspergillusspores are in the environment and will likely be breathed in at some point, but they rarely cause disease. One exception may be in people who have severe immune compromise. As with birds, the best way to decrease exposure toAspergillusspores is to keep a clean home in order to limit the inhalation of fungal spores.

Category: Avian Gastric Yeast
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Avian gastric yeast infection is a bird disease caused by a yeast,Macrorhabdus sp,that causes gastrointestinal problems. It is highly contagious and affects a variety of birds. An older name for it is megabacteria because of its size. The organism infects the bird’s stomach, and the infection destroys the ability of the bird’s stomach to properly digest and absorb nutrients from food. Avian Stomach Anatomy The avian stomach is quite unlike the human one and has two parts with a connector. The proventriculus digests food; the isthmus moves food between the proventriculus and the gizzard; and the gizzard grinds food for easier digestion. Food moves back and forth between the proventriculus and gizzard until it is fully digested and the nutrients are absorbed. Who gets Avian Gastric Yeast? This disease occurs in a wide range of birds, such as chickens, partridges, ostriches, turkeys, parrots, finches, and budgerigars. Being infected with avian gastric yeast does not always result in infection and subsequent disease. Signs Signs of avian gastric yeast infection and disease are nonspecific and can take on two forms:  acute and chronic. Diagnosis As avian gastric yeast is transmitted through the fecal to oral route, fresh fecal samples are used as a quick diagnostic tool. Fecal testsare not highly accurate as the organism is shed sporadically in droppings. A negative test does not rule out infection. Histology, a sample of the tissue, is the only definitive test for avian gastric yeast infection. An isthmus tissue sample is usually done after death because of the complication and risk of a surgical procedure. Treatment Treatment outcome varies depending on the severity of the clinical signs the bird is experiencing. Prevention There is no vaccine to prevent avian gastric yeast. The only way to prevent the infection from spreading is clearing it from your flock. Quarantine all new birds for 30 days before introducing them to the flock. A veterinary exam is a necessity for all new birds.

Category: Clostridium difficile Becoming more Common in North America
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What IsClostridium difficile? Some strains contain genes that allow them to produce toxins. It is the toxins, not the bacteria themselves, that make a person or an animal sick. They can form spores, which can survive for years in the environment and are resistant to many disinfectants. If ingested, the spores germinate and the bacteria begin to grow when they reach the intestine. How Common IsClostridium difficile? HumansIn developed countries,C. difficileis the leading cause of infectious hospital-associated diarrhea in adults and accounts for 15-25% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is becoming more common in North America. The most important risk factor forC. difficileinfection (CDI) is treatment with antibiotics. The antibiotics affect the normal “good” bacteria in the intestine, which sometimes allowsC. difficileto take over and grow faster. Old age, certain cancer treatments, long hospitalization, some acid-suppressants used to treat stomach ulcers, intestinal surgery, and some other procedures also increase the likelihood of CDI. A hyper-virulentC. difficilestrain (ribotype 027/NAP1) has emerged in North America, Europe, and Japan, and has been responsible for epidemics of severe illness in hospitalized patients. Recently, severe illness due to CDI has been reported in some healthy, non-hospitalized people as well. AnimalsA small percentage of healthy dogs and cats (0-4%) carryC. difficilein their intestine. But in puppies, kittens, animals in breeding colonies, and dogs that visit human hospitals, the percentage may be higher (up to 30%). The bacteria can also be found in other types of pets, but it is unknown how common this is. How Do Animals And People Become Infected WithC. difficile? Clostridium difficilelives in the intestine of people and animals. When the bacteria are passed into the stool, they form spores that can survive in the environment for a long time. The bacteria are transmitted when the spores are ingested. This typically happens when there is stool contamination on something a person touches, and then the person touches their nose or mouth. Contamination of food and water can also be a problem. It is unclear ifC. difficilecan be transmitted from pets to people. The types ofC. difficilefound in pets are often the same as those found in people, including the epidemic strain ribotype 027/NAP1. So it makes sense thatC. difficilecould potentially be transmitted between people and animals, but there is still no conclusive proof. For now, it is best to err on the side of caution and considerC. difficiletransmissible between pets and people until proven otherwise. What Happens If A Person Or Animal GetsClostridium difficileInfection (CDI)? HumansIn people, CDI (which is also sometimes calledC. difficile-associated disease, or CDAD) may cause no illness at all, or anywhere from very mild to very severe diarrhea. Additional complications can also occur, particularly in people who are already sick for another reason. In some cases, the disease can be fatal. AnimalsThe vast majority of dogs and cats that carryC. difficilein their intestine do not become ill. However, there does appear to be a link betweenC. difficileand diarrhea in dogs in some cases, and there is one report ofC. difficilepossibly causing diarrhea in two cats. In most of these cases the diarrhea is mild, and clinically appears the same as diarrhea due to other common causes. Occasionally, more severe illness and diarrhea may occur. How IsClostridium difficileInfection Diagnosed? In animals and people, CDI is diagnosed by testing the stool for the toxins that are produced by the bacteria. Just findingC. difficile(by culturing the stool, for example) does not mean that it is causing a problem because not all strains can produce toxins. Even strains that can produce toxins don’t produce them all the time, so the bacteria can be found in perfectly healthy people and animals. Detecting the toxins themselves is the key. Testing animals that do not have diarrhea forC. difficileis not recommended. How IsClostridium difficileInfection Treated? In humans, many cases of CDI are caused by treatment with antibiotics for some other infection. In mild cases, diarrhea may resolve with no additional specific treatment. In severe cases, other antibiotics may be needed to controlC. difficile. Probiotics are not considered effective for the treatment of CDI in humans. Some (if not most) cases of CDI in pets resolve without additional antibiotics. If the animal has a lot of diarrhea it may need to be given fluids to prevent dehydration. There is no vaccine available forC. difficilefor any species. If you (or your pet) develop diarrhea while being treated with antibiotics, tell your physician or veterinarian right away. However, it is very important you only stop or change the medication you are taking or giving to your pet if you are told to do so by your physician or veterinarian. Otherwise, the infection for which the antibiotics were originally prescribed may get worse. What Do I Do If My Pet Is Diagnosed WithClostridium difficile? For surfaces that can’t be bleached, thorough cleaning is the most important step to physically remove as much contamination as possible. Steam cleaning is a reasonable way to reduce the number ofC. difficilespores that may be left in rugs, carpets, or similar floor coverings. Therapy Animals Visiting healthcare facilities is a risk factor forC. difficileshedding in dogs. However, it is unclear whether therapy pets that visit hospitals and nursing homes have an increased risk of developingC. difficilediarrhea. Healthy animals do NOT need to be tested or treated forC. difficile. There are guidelines available to help reduce the risk of pets acquiring infectious diseases in hospitals, which should be followed if your pet is part of a visitation program. These include If I HaveClostridium difficile, Should I Test My Pet? NO. Even if your pet was found to be sheddingC. difficilein its stool, you still would not know if it was the same strain you were carrying. This type of specialized testing is not readily available and is not indicated in most situations. If you haveC. difficile, you should be very thorough about washing your hands after using the washroom. Also try to prevent your pet from drinking from the toilet, if it tends to do so. The risk of disease to the general population posed byC. difficilein house pets such as dogs and cats is: Healthy Adults Individuals with compromised immune systems (e.g. HIV/AIDS, transplant, and cancer patients) are more susceptible to many kinds of infections, including those which may be transmitted by pets. While these individuals are not advised to get rid of their pets, precautions should be taken to reduce the frequency of contacts that could result in pathogen transmission (e.g. avoiding contact with any animal feces), as well as the ability of infectious agents to survive in the household (e.g. prompt and thorough disinfection of potentially contaminated surfaces). Infants and young children (less than 5 years old) are more likely than adults to extensively handle animals if given the opportunity, more likely to touch their faces or mouths, and less likely to wash their hands after handling an animal. Children may “snuggle” with pets such as dogs and cats; this very close contact can increase the risk of disease transmission. Young children should be supervised when playing with animals, and an adult should ensure that they wash their hands afterward, especially before handling food. Older children should be taught to do the same. It is important to note that infants less than 12 months of age are not affected byC. difficile. For these groups, the zoonotic risk posed byC. difficilein house pets such as dogs and cats is likely: Additional Information Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).Clostridium difficileinformationpage.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Clostridium difficileinfection.

Category: Common Bacterial Diseases in Backyard Chickens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English They’re adorable. They’re fluffy. They’re organic.Whether as pets or as a food source,backyard chickensare increasingly popular. All sorts of folks, particularly those in or near large cities, are exploring the joys backyard chickens have to offer, often for the first time. While keeping and caring for chickens is exciting, it is also a serious responsibility. Just as cats and dogs can get sick with various diseases, so can chickens. One of the many causes that can make chickens sick are bacteria. Chickens as Food Animals Regardless of whether your birds or their eggs are consumed, chickens are considered food animals and are subject to federal and state regulations. When a chicken is sick, some of the medications your veterinarian can prescribe may have a drug withdrawal period. This means you will have to wait to eat eggs, meat, and other biproducts during treatment and for a period after treatment ends to make sure there are not any drug residues in what you are eating. You must keep this in mind if your birds are treated for a bacterial disease. Your veterinarian will give you a drug withdrawal period. As an owner, this means if your birds test positive for particular infectious diseases, a state veterinarian may visit and evaluate your flock. Restrictions and regulations vary by state, but some state veterinarians have the authority to order a depopulation (euthanasia) of flocks for public health reasons.  Bacterial diseases that can cause federal agencies to get involved includeSalmonella pullorum, Salmonella gallinarum(fowl typhoid), and sometimesMycoplasmas. Disease Prevention Strategies Taking proper care of chickens requires extensive attention and should be thoroughly understoodbeforeyou decide to bring chickens home. There are general steps you can take to prevent bacterial disease in your backyard flock, including proper husbandry and biosecurity practices. Examples of good husbandry that can reduce the likelihood of bacterial diseases include proper nutrition, clean and fresh water, suitable housing with adequate ventilation, and plenty of space for each chicken. All of these measures help reduce stress and make your birds less susceptible to disease. Biosecurity is the measures you take to prevent introducing and spreading diseases. Some measures are wearing clothing and shoes that you only wear when working with the flock, obtaining birds from known disease-free flocks, and having a separate isolation area for quarantine and sick animals, and separating age groups. One effective way to prevent bacterial diseases is by purchasing birds and chicks from a reputable, disease-free source, such as buying birds from flocks that are certified by theNational Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP). The NPIP program provides monitoring and testing for a number of infectious diseases includingSalmonellaspecies, Mycoplasmaspecies,and avian influenza. Poultry farms can be NPIP-certified for each specific disease, and all birds (and breeders producing eggs and chicks) being sold across state lines must be certified negative forSalmonellapullorum/typhoid and avian influenza before transport.  If you want birds that are negative forMycoplasma, the flock must be certified for eachMycoplasmaspecies. Sourcing your birds from certified flocks is a great way to prevent disease, and prevention is always easier than treatment since many bacterial diseases in poultry cannot be cured. Treatment For the majority of chicken bacterial diseases, treatment involves antibiotics. They can be given in the water or with pills (there are other ways that are impractical for flocks of less than 500). How they are given depends on the specific disease and which method is most practical. While treatment can help resolve symptoms in your birds, many chicken bacterial infections can never be cured. These birds that no longer show symptoms become carriers, and will be able to spread the bacteria to other uninfected birds. This carrier status is common among chicken bacterial diseases and there are several options if your birds fall into this category. One option is depopulation of your flock. Combined with proper sanitation of the environment, this option allows for complete eradication of the bacterial disease affecting your chickens. Many backyard chicken owners are more than reluctant to pursue this option. Thankfully, there are alternatives. Another option is to treat your birds for the disease, and accept that your flock will be persistently infected, and may need to be treated multiple times as symptoms reoccur. In these cases, you will need to work with your veterinarian to keep your birds healthy and reduce symptoms. Depending on the disease, you may be required to inform anyone about the bacteria the chickens carry to whomever comes into contact with your chickens or their products. If you decide to keep infected birds, your flock should remain closed. This means birds should not enter or leave the flock. If chicks are not allowed to hatch, eventually your birds will naturally die off. Once this happens, the environment can be cleaned and you can get birds that you know are disease free. Alternatively, there are vaccines against some of the bacterial diseases that can be given to new chickens you want to integrate into your closed and infected flock. These vaccines often do not prevent infection, but do prevent symptoms. Talk with your veterinarian about what options work best for your flock since treatment often does not cure. Bacterial Diseases See charts 1 and 2 for a summary of each disease. Note:Mycoplasmaspecies are not technically bacteria but are similar and thus the diseases they cause are listed here. Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD)-Mycoplasma gallisepticum Mycoplasma gallisepticumis a common chronic and mild disease in chickens.Symptoms include coughing, lung noises, sneezing, nasal discharge, eye discharge, and facial swelling. Younger birds are more severely affected and can show signs of stunted growth and, in some cases, death. Chickens can become infected and spread CRD through direct contact with infected or carrier birds, contact with contaminated equipment, or from hen to chick. It can be diagnosed by submitting samples for testing. Treatment is with antibiotics although it is not curative and only treats clinical signs.  Birds remain carriers for life, and can spread the disease to other birds and their offspring. Infectious Coryza Infectious coryza is caused byAvibacterium paragallinarum,and occurs in all age groups but most commonly occurs in semi-mature to adult birds.  Coryza is usually seen in situations where the area is never emptied of chickens. This disease has a rapid onset, but once it is established in a flock, the remaining birds become carriers for life, even if they do not show any symptoms. Symptoms may include swelling of the face around the eyes and sometimes the wattles, sneezing, nasal and eye discharge, pink eye, swollen sinuses, and sometimes lower respiratory infections. Introducing infected or carrier birds causes it in a flock. Treatment options include depopulation or antibiotics but recovered birds will remain carriers. If chickens with this disease are kept and replacement birds are added to the flock, there is a vaccine available that can be given to incoming birds but that is only feasible for large flocks, not backyard chickens. Fowl Cholera Fowl cholera is caused byPasteurella multocida,with mature chickens being more susceptible to disease than younger birds. Chickens can become infected by carriers that are not showing symptoms, wild birds, predators, rodents, pigs, cats, and contaminated equipment and environments. Symptoms range from difficulty breathing, fever, reduced appetite, reduced egg production, rapid weight loss and sudden death to swollen face, wattles, and swollen joints. Antibiotic treatment can be given for confirmed diagnoses, although your birds will likely remain carriers. A vaccine is available and can be used in regions where fowl cholera is common, but that is not a substitute for good sanitary practices. Rodent control and preventing your flock from associating with wild birds is important in preventing fowl cholera. Infectious Synovitis Infectious synovitis is caused byMycoplasma synoviaeand can affect birds in two ways: Chickens can show either signs of respiratory disease or lameness. This disease can spread through the egg from hen to chick, direct contact, respiratory particles over short distances, and by indirect contacts, such as on equipment or a person’s clothing. Treatment by antibiotics is used to reduce symptoms, which often come back again after treatment is finished. Once a flock has the disease, they are carriers for life. Breeding flocks can be certified NPIP negative, so acquiring from certified negative flocks is ideal. Botulism Botulism is caused byClostridium botulinumand can affect birds of any age. Chickens become exposed by ingesting contaminated food, water, carcasses, maggots, decaying organic material, and sometimes bugs. Depending on the amount of toxin ingested, symptoms can range from dullness and sleepiness to paralysis of the legs, wings and neck and death within 12-24 hours. To treat and prevent botulism in your birds, focus on eliminating potential sources of toxin production by removing all dead animals immediately, controlling fly and insect populations, and preventing access to decaying organic matter. Birds should not be given food and water by mouth until they are able to lift their head up. Vitamins and antibiotics are reported to reduce death rates. Antitoxin is available but it is difficult to get and expensive. In areas exposure to botulism is high, there is a vaccine available Pullorum Disease In the U.S.,Salmonella pullorumhas been eradicated by those participating in NPIP but can be found in other countries. Pullorum disease is caused bySalmonella pullorumand is highly fatal to young chicks. Adult birds may or may not show unthriftiness, but spread theSalmonellathrough the egg to chicks. The infected chicks then spread theSalmonellato the other chicks. Often eggs have decreased hatchability, and clincal signs in chicks include weakness, lack of appetite, sleepiness, sudden death, a higher mortality around 4-5 days old, droopiness, chilled appearance and huddling under heat sources, and white diarrhea with a “pasted-down” appearance around the vent. After a week of age, birds that inhaled the organisms in the hatcher may show respiratory signs. The number of deaths peaks around 2-3 weeks of age. Birds that survive are irregular in size, unthrifty, stunted, or poorly feathered. Pullorum disease can get into your flock through direct contact with carrier chickens, contamination of equipment and from hen to chick. Once your birds are affected, they will be carriers for the rest of their lives. Prevention includes purchasing birds and eggs from NPIP-certified flocks or similar eradication programs. Fowl Typhoid Fowl typhoid has also been eradicated in the U.S. It is caused bySalmonella gallinarumand while chickens of any age can be affected, it primarily occurs in young adults older than 12 weeks of age. It can get into your flock through direct contact with contamination of equipment, carrier chickens, and from hen to chick. Signs of illness include sudden death (sometimes sporadic), listlessness, yellow diarrhea, loss of appetite, and a pale, anemic appearance of comb and wattles. Prevention includes purchasing birds and eggs from NPIP-certified flocks or similar eradication programs. Paratyphoid Paratyphoid is caused by a type ofSalmonellaand affects mainly young birds. Signs of illness are similar to those seen with pullorum disease and include anorexia, diarrhea and reduced egg production. However, chickens are often asymptomatic so your birds may seem unaffected despite harboring this bacterium. Treatment and prevention are similar to those for fowl typhoid. Necrotic Enteritis Necrotic enteritis is caused byClostridium perfringensand most heavily affects chickens 2-12 weeks of age. If your flock is affected you may see birds become acutely depressed and die within hours or dark, often blood-stained diarrhea, reduced appetite and weight loss. Birds become infected by eating contaminated fecal matter, soil and other material. Unlike other diseases, treatment with antibiotics will resolve this disease in your chickens. In addition, your veterinarian may recommend supportive vitamin treatment to enhance the effectiveness of the antibiotics. Necrotic enteritis tends to occur more frequently in overcrowded, immuno-suppressed flocks so good husbandry and management are particularly important in prevention. Part of this husbandry involves having an effective deworming protocol as coccidiosis may be a contributing factor. Salpingitis Salpingitis (inflammation of the tube through which the eggs pass) has many causes, some of which do not involve bacteria. When bacteria are involved though, it is usuallyE. coli. Salpingitis is common in older birds and affected hens may show signs of decreased egg production, a distended stomach, and difficulty walking. Your chickens cannot spread this disease to each other as it is mostly caused by changes in their reproductive system related to age. As a result, this is no way to prevent salpingitis. You can, however, still treat your birds with antibiotics if they become infected. Your chickens may need surgery to remove their tube to completely resolve this issue. Bumblefoot Bumblefoot is a common condition among backyard poultry typically complicated by secondary bacterial infections, particularlyStaphylococcusspecies. If any of your chickens develop bumblefoot, it could be due to pressure necrosis (in which pressure restricts the flow of blood, causing the skin tissue to die) from inappropriate footing, trauma, and abnormal posture and weight bearing. The effects of pressure necrosis are especially important if your chickens are obese as this increases the compression of the soft tissue structures in their feet. If affected, you may see a progression of signs. Initially, less severe signs include redness of the foot followed by swelling, pain, and in severe cases, loss of function. Depending on the degree your chickens are affected, treatment ranges from foot soaks and pressure-relieving bandages to surgery. Prevention goes a long way in terms of bumblefoot and includes an appropriate diet, proper footing and perches, and good drainage of the chicken coop to avoid wet or muddy ground. Colibacillosis Colibacillosis is caused byE. coliand can affect chickens of all ages in many ways. Depending on the body system affected, you may see signs of respiratory distress, GI signs like diarrhea, or sudden death. Diagnosis of colibacillosis can be difficult as many strains ofE. coliare normal inhabitants of your chickens’ intestinal tracts and do not cause disease. Thus, your veterinarian will need to look at the entire picture as well as laboratory results since a positive test does not necessarily meanE. coliis responsible. If your chickens are suffering from colibacillosis, treatment options include antibiotics but these have variable success. Preventing this disease focuses heavily on proper management and sanitation practices and reducing stress factors that make your birds more susceptible to infection. Examples of these practices include adequate ventilation, good litter and range conditions, and properly cleaned facilities. If you have any questions, contact your veterinarian. Chart 1: Common Bacterial Diseases and Symptoms  Disease Bacterial Agent(s) Primary Body System Affected Symptoms Chronic Respiratory Disease/Mycoplasmosis Mycoplasma gallisepticum Respiratory Coughing, discharge around the eyes and nose, facial swelling, unthriftiness Infectious Coryza Avibacterium paragallinarum Respiratory Difficulty breathing, facial swelling around eyes and wattles, swollen sinuses, hallmark foul-smelling, sticky discharge around eyes and nose and decreased egg production Fowl Cholera/ Pasteurellosis Pasteurella multocida Respiratory Inflammation of the conjunctiva and sinuses (redness, swelling, pain, increased heat), swelling and darkening (cyanosis) of the face and wattles, loss of appetite, stupor, rapid weight loss, lameness, difficulty breathing, watery yellowish or green diarrhea Infectious Synovitis Mycoplasma synoviae Respiratory and Musculoskeletal Lameness followed by lethargy, reluctance to move, swollen joints, stilted gait, weight loss, and breast blisters.

Can range from listlessness, ruffled feathers, fever, labored breathing, and diarrhea to sudden death. Diseases marked with an * can be caused by other non-bacterial factors too. Bumblefoot** is not caused by bacteria but secondary bacterial infections are common. Chart 2: Treatment and Prevention  Disease (body system affected) Treatment Prevention Chronic Respiratory Disease/Mycoplasmosis Antibiotic therapy but birds will remain carriers for life Obtain birds from knownMycoplasma-free flocks or depopulate flock and repopulate with clean stock. Infectious Coryza Antibiotic therapy but birds remain carriers for life Vaccine available; multiple doses required. Fowl Cholera/ Pasteurellosis Prolonged antibiotic therapy but birds remain carriers for life Vaccination through use of bacterins. Infectious Synovitis Antibiotic therapy with injectables most effective Obtain birds only from NPIP-certified flocks. Botulism Mildly affected birds separated and given mild laxatives, water into crop twice daily, and Epsom salts mixed into feed. Antitoxin available but very expensive. Eliminate sources of toxin production by prompt removal of all dead animals, controlling fly and insect populations and avoid access to decaying organic matter. Pullorum Disease/ Salmonellosis/ “White Diarrhea” Eradicated in the U.S. Obtain birds only from NPIP-certified disease-free flocks or similar eradication programs. Fowl Typhoid Eradicated in the U.S. Obtain birds only from NPIP-certified disease-free flocks or similar eradication programs. Paratyphoid Similar to fowl typhoid Similar to fowl typhoid Necrotic Enteritis/ Rot gut Antibiotic therapy. Supportive vitamin treatment may enhance effectiveness.

Category: Psittacosis in Birds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Psittacosis? Psittacosis, also known as parrot fever, ornithosis, and avian chlamydiosis, is a bacterial infection found in at least 465 species of birds worldwide. It is highly contagious among birds and can spread to people. Any pet bird can get this disease, but cockatiels, budgies, and parrots are the most commonly affected companion species. Psittacosis may kill more than 50% of birds it infects, but ultimately the risk of death depends on such factors as the species and the health of the bird. What Causes it? Psittacosis is caused byChlamydia psittaci,a bacterium that enters, multiplies in, and destroys cells of the infected bird.C. psittacimay target cells throughout the bird’s digestive system, respiratory system, or entire body. How is Psittacosis Transmitted? Infected birds may shedC. psittaciin their droppings, saliva, mucus, feather dust, and eye/nasal discharge. Healthy birds may then inhale this bacteria in airborne particles, such as dust from dried droppings and feathers. Birds may also ingestC. psittacifrom contaminated food, water, perches, and toys. While these are the most common modes of transmission, blood-sucking insects such as lice may also spread the bacteria among birds. A mother bird may also transferC. psittacito her chicks before or after they hatch. What are the Signs? Not all birds infected withC. psittaciappear sick. These birds are called carriers. They appear healthy but may become ill and shed the bacteria during times of stress (e.g., battling another infection, changing diet, or living in a crowded environment). Species including budgies, cockatiels, and cockatoos are more likely to be carriers, while lorikeets, canaries, and rosellas are more likely to become sick and show symptoms. How is Psittacosis Diagnosed? Signs of psittacosis are similar to those of many other diseases. Therefore, your veterinarian may do blood tests, take X-rays, or run some additional specific tests to more definitively diagnose psittacosis. Those specific tests include measuring antibody levels in the bird’s blood and testing forC. psittaciin swabs from the bird’s mouth, eyes, and vent. The vent is the shared opening of the urinary, digestive, and reproductive tracts. How is it Treated? Doxycyclineis the antibiotic of choice for combatingC. psittaci. However, it may not completely eliminateC. psittacifrom the body, leaving the bird a seemingly healthy carrier that could spread the disease to other birds or become ill again under stressful conditions. To lower this risk, a veterinarian may prescribe doxycycline for 2-8 weeks; the usual duration is 45 days. This medication may be given by mouth, injection, or in food/water. The veterinarian will decide the best method for your bird based on its species and the severity of disease. If the bird is given doxycycline by mouth, its calcium intake from such sources as mineral blocks and cuttlebone should be reduced because calcium may limit the absorption of doxycycline. If the bird is suffering from a severe form of psittacosis, your veterinarian may also provide fluids, heat, and other additional treatments to relieve the symptoms. How can Psittacosis be Prevented in Birds and Humans? Birds should always be fed a healthy diet and live in clean, uncrowded, and non-stressful conditions to reduce the risk of illness. Any new bird should be examined by a veterinarian, tested forC. psittaci,and quarantined for 30 days or more. An infected bird should be isolated and treated. Anything that has been in contact with the infected bird should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Because psittacosis can spread from birds to humans, you should always wear protective gear such as a mask, gown, eyewear, and gloves when interacting with the infected bird. It is also important to wash your hands after each interaction. What is the Prognosis? The mortality rate of psittacosis can reach upwards of 50% in birds. However, this percentage depends on such factors as the species and health of the affected bird and how early the disease is caught and treated. If psittacosis is caught early and treated properly, the prognosis may actually be quite good. Stressful conditions or simultaneous infections may result in more severe disease and a worse outcome. It should also be noted that although treatment may make the bird feel better, the bird may remain a carrier ofC. psittaci. This means the bird could become sick with psittacosis and spread it to other birds at some point in the future.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is it? Proventricular dilatation disease is an inflammatory disease affecting the gastrointestinal and neurological systems in a variety of bird species. PDD is incurable, but manageable. Consequences of PDD range from gastrointestinal problems causing an increase in the size of the bird’s stomach to neurological symptoms. The disease is caused by avian bornavirus, which targets the bird’s nervous system. The damaged nervous system does not allow nutrients to be digested or absorbed. The virus does not always cause the disease, so a bird can have bornavirus and never develop PDD. Research on the virus and disease is still ongoing with much to be discovered. Who gets it? These are only some of the affected species, but more than 50 different parrot species can be affected. How is it spread? What are the signs? The signs can happen quickly or take time to develop. However, all the symptoms are general and are not specific to PDD. How is it diagnosed? The symptoms of PDD are not specific and there are a variety of potential causes explaining the bird’s illness such as lead toxicity, fungal or bacterial infection, or parasites. Therefore, other potential causes must be ruled out first before a diagnosis of PDD can be made. A physical examination by your veterinarian is first so a professional can see the clinical signs. Tests may include bloodwork, such as complete blood count or serology, radiographs to look for an enlarged stomach, a stomach biopsy to detect infected tissue and nerves, and other laboratory tests, such as PCR. How is it treated? There is no cure for PDD, so treatment reduces inflammation and the other symptoms. How do you prevent it? Infected birds should be isolated for life to prevent the virus spreading to other pet birds. New birds should be isolated and tested for the virus before they are introduced to the flock. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine to protect birds from avian bornavirus.

Category: Dietary Conversion  – Getting your Bird to Eat Right
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English By now you've most likely heard that a pelleted (formulated) diet should make up the majority (70-80%) of your pet bird's diet. Saying this is all good and well for us bird veterinarians, but how can you achieve this at home? Well, like many things, there is more than one way to convert your bird to a healthy diet.  You can use one approach, or combine them. Gradual Introduction With this technique you mix pellets in with your bird's regular food and slowly increase the percentage of pellets being offered. No matter what approach you use, it is important to ensure your bird continues to eat. For some birds 10 days is too quick to allow for complete conversion. In these cases try changing the percentage every other day. This will mean a 20-day conversion period, rather than 10. Depending on your schedule you may or may not see your bird eating much. So how do you make sure your bird is getting adequate nutrition? Substitution This approach is quite simple: Just offer the regular food in the morning and then remove that food at night and introduce the new pelleted diet. Flock Foraging This technique works well for bird species that like to eat on the ground, such as cockatiels and budgies (parakeets). The approach is especially useful for tame birds. Good luck with this sometimes challenging, but always rewarding process. It can lead to life-long health benefits for your feathered friends.

Category: Diets for Healthy Parrots
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Seeds are not an appropriate or natural diet for birds. Seeds are the reproductive part of a plant’s life cycle and, as such, they are not available all year round. Wild birds have no choice other than to eat more than just seed – they also eat green buds, roots and tubers, insects, leaves, flowers, bark, and even dirt! For years, people gave their birds a mostly seed-based diet simply because there wasn’t enough guidance on what a good pet bird diet is, and birds lived much shorter lifespans than they should have because of their terrible nutrition. A diet consisting of mostly seeds is the avian equivalent of a person living on fast food and cookies. Seeds are a teeny, tiny part of their diet in the wild. Captive parrots love to eat seeds because of the high-fat level that makes them taste good; like children and dogs, birds often prefer junk food to healthy food. Sadly, a seed diet will not give your pet bird a full lifespan with good health and will instead give them viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, and unnecessary veterinary bills for you. Consider: An all-fresh diet for birds, often defined as one without pellets or seeds, is also not recommended. It generally consists of a variety of cooked foods, such as beans, grains, and pasta, with a variety of fresh vegetables and a bit of fresh fruit. It tends to lack the correct variety of vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Fresh doesn't necessarily mean balanced, and this diet usually lacks sufficient calcium. Balanced means that the right nutrients are given in adequate amounts that won't interfere with other nutrients or be toxic. A bird’s body cannot absorb enough calcium if there is more phosphorus in the diet than calcium. In general, avian veterinarians see more clinical problems, such as obesity and metabolic bone disease, in birds using fresh-food diets than with an appropriate diet. So What Should They Eat? A good diet boosts the immune system and helps the bird ward off illness. Not only that, but also a good diet keeps a bird in good spirits, keeps their feathers in great condition, and improves life overall. Remember- wild birds eat a wide variety of foods such as nuts, grasses, flowers, fruits, insects, seeds, and the list goes on. New seasons bring new types of foods, and they eat what is available. Captive birds also eat what’s available, whether it’s good for them or not. While not enough research has been done about the healthiest diet for birds for anyone to know absolute specifics, we can safely say that pellets are formulated to meet the best guesses for nutritional requirements based on the information available. The first formulated diets for birds were created in the 1970s and have kept improving. While birds can have some seeds without problems – given as a treat – their diet should be 60% formulated pellets and 40% vegetables, with seeds and fruit used only as treats. Birds on a pelleted diet live longer, have fewer health problems, and look better than birds on a seed diet. A diet of 100% pellets is rarely healthy either, as there is no ‘one diet’ recommended for parrots that have evolved in a wide range of geographical and climatic conditions, e.g., arid zone birds (budgies and cockatiels) versus rainforest birds (macaws and Eclectus). Many people say that their birds will not eat pellets. The likely reason is not because of the taste, but because the bird doesn’t recognize pellets as food. Birds are like cats in that they get used to what they first ate as youngsters, and many dislike trying new foods. It’s easier to start with a baby bird than an adult, but as with cats, it can be done. We have to teach many birds, just as their parents would have done, what is safe to eat, even if it may take longer than we realize. To switch a bird from an all-seed diet, the first step is to determine how much seed they eat. Measure how many teaspoons of seed your bird eats in 24 hours. Measure the amount fed in the morning and then 24 hours later blow off the husks and measure how much is left. The difference is the amount eaten. Repeat this exercise for 3-4 days to get an idea of the average daily consumption. The next step is to then only feed that amount of seed that you know your bird eats, but now mixed with an equal amount of the formulated pellets and thawed mixed frozen vegetables. Mix it all together to make a uniformly distributed mash. The last step is to then take away a pinch of seed each day. This makes your bird slightly hungrier each day, and as they forage through the mash they start eating the pellets and the vegetables. At the end of 2-3 weeks, most birds are eating the formulated diet and vegetables, and vegetables and aren’t getting any seed at all. It may take longer with some individuals. Other tricks that work with some birds: If at any time during this conversion period, your bird looks unwell or develops small black droppings, feed it some seed immediately. You may have pushed too hard and your bird is starving. Vegetables and Fruits Remember, 40% of your bird’s diet should be vegetables. Three main vegetable types can be fed to birds, easily grouped by color: All fruit is high in sugar and should be given only as a treat. Low glycemic index (GI) fruits should be given. Fruits high on the GI, such as watermelon, are rapidly digested and absorbed and result in marked fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Low-GI fruits (apples, apricots, bananas, grapes, kiwis, peaches, pears, plums, strawberries) are more slowly digested and absorbed, producing gradual rises in blood sugar. Remember that the fruits that many of the captive parrots eat in the wild are not often available in the human market. A Special Note about Lorikeets Lorikeets are unique among parrots in that their anatomy and metabolism have evolved around a high-energy lifestyle. Wild lorikeets eat high-sugar, easily digested foods (pollen, nectar, and fruit) but burn it off quickly. In captivity, lorikeets fed a similar diet are likely to gain weight and suffer the associated health problems. They should be fed small amounts of commercial lorikeet diets (i.e., 1 dessert spoon per day) and low GI fruits and vegetables. Lifespan and Diet While there are approximately 279 species of parrots, one reliable rule of thumb is that the bigger the bird is, the longer they will live, to around 70 years or so – and even 90 is not unheard of for the largest parrots. Captive cockatiels can live for 15-25 years, lovebirds 10-25 years, parakeets 7-14 years, pigeons 5-10 years, and the tiny finch 2-5 years. However, those lifespans depend on appropriate nutrition and lifestyle. Birds do best with a formulated pellet diet and vegetables, enrichment activities, exercise, space, attention, and veterinary care. Birds fed a less-than-appropriate diet will not be so lucky.

Category: Foraging in Companion and Aviary Birds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Foraging as a Natural Behavior One big piece of the puzzle keeping your pet bird happy and healthy is daily maintenance. These behaviors are essential for birds in the wild to survive. They are likely just as crucial for your pet bird’s behavioral and mental well-being. These maintenance behaviors include foraging, social interaction, and feather care. Among these, the focus here is on the natural act of searching for, finding and mechanically processing a source of food, otherwise known as foraging. Depending on the species, many wild birds spend the majority of their day foraging. For example, wild parrots can occupy up to 70% of their awake time each day with this activity. Their counterpart — your pet bird — likely also has an intrinsic drive to engage in foraging. Some birds, such as parrots, are so similar to their wild relatives that they are not considered domesticated and thus have the same foraging drive as wild birds. Studies have shown that given a choice, animals will choose to work for their food rather than choosing freely available food. Foraging represents a requirement for your bird’s well-being and a natural behavior that can help provide a balanced, healthy lifestyle. The Importance of Foraging Foraging is an example of enrichment. Enrichment involves providing animals with opportunities to engage in species-appropriate behaviors, giving them a greater sense of control of their environment. This feeling of control empowers animals, and encourages exploration, boldness, and calmer behavior when exposed to stressful situations. It helps avian pets stay active mentally and physically, enhancing their overall quality of life. This mental stimulation is especially important for birds who are highly intelligent. For example, parrots are equivalent to a 3- to 5-year-old child and are capable of using higher levels of thinking. Foraging is also a great way to prevent behavioral problems that can progress to medical issues. If your bird does not receive enough social stimulation through interaction with people or other birds, they are more likely to spend more time either foraging or taking care of their feathers. Without foraging as a continuous option, some birds are more likely to engage in excessive preening. This excess can progress to feather destruction and loss, skin damage, and secondary infections. In these cases, foraging can be used as both a prevention strategy and a management tool to help treat feather destruction and other behavioral disorders. Foraging may also help to treat other social behavioral disorders, such as screaming and other abnormal vocalizations, and pair bonding behaviors that can result in issues with their reproductive drive. Thus, incorporating foraging opportunities into your bird’s daily lifestyle can help prevent and, if needed, treat various behavioral and medical issues. Any behavior or medical disorder should be thoroughly investigated by your veterinarian so that interventions to complement foraging are also applied if appropriate. Setting your Bird up for Success When it comes to foraging in pet birds, the options are seemingly unlimited. Some birds may need training to learn how to forage, and some may need specific environmental considerations for foraging opportunities. This last is particularly the case for birds who are visually impaired, physically limited with arthritis, or if they never had foraging opportunities when they were young. If foraging is not introduced appropriately with consideration given to these birds’ individual needs, then they may become frustrated and not eat, or they could risk physical injury. Underweight birds should be monitored to make sure their nutritional needs are being met while they learn to forage. Check with your veterinarian to make sure foraging, or how to go about it, is suitable for your bird. If it is, remember a few key things. Start simple, go slow, and gradually increase the amount of work your bird has to do to get the food reward. Regardless of which tools you use to encourage foraging, it’s essential to work within your bird’s comfort zone and skillset, especially if your bird is being introduced to foraging for the first time. This activity is supposed to be enjoyable and enriching for your bird; it should elicit curiosity and excitement, not fear or anxiety. They need to maintain their healthy, well-balanced diet while learning. One way to do this and incorporate foraging is to use their normal diet. Instead of providing your bird with free access to their regular food in an open bowl, slowly offer them food through foraging only. This may mean initially providing a third of the normal amount of food through foraging and the rest in your previous method. The eventual goal is to get your bird to forage for all their food. Taking things slowly is important as you want to make sure your bird is getting the proper nutrition they need throughout the process. There are several things you can do to ensure your bird’s experience with foraging is a good one. Depending on your bird’s individual anxiety levels and response to changes in their environment, some birds may find certain foraging tools frightening. One way to avoid fear is to introduce new objects to them slowly. Instead of buying a new foraging toy and sticking it into their cage right away, give your bird the chance to notice it from afar, outside their cage. You can also introduce new objects with desired food items, so your bird associates the object with something they enjoy. Another way is to start with things you already have around the house. For example, you can hide pieces of food in crumpled-up paper, stick food items in between the scales of a pinecone, or use wood items with drilled holes to hide food. Other ideas include hiding food in cardboard boxes, shredded paper, wood shavings, or paper towel and toilet paper tubes. These methods allow your bird to start learning how to forage with items they may already be familiar with, reducing potential fear or anxiety. Many birds will require a good amount of patience and guidance from you, especially in the beginning. Whenever you introduce your bird to a new foraging tool or method, allow them to see you slowly hide the food item in the tool. For example, if you hide a food item in a crumpled piece of paper, make sure your bird sees the treat and sees you hiding it. This way, your bird knows to look there for the reward. Moreover, do not hesitate to gently help your bird obtain the item. Allow your bird the time and space to work through the challenge, but do not let them get frustrated. This can work against you as birds can get so frustrated they give up and lose their motivation to explore other challenges. If your bird repeatedly gets frustrated quickly or you find yourself constantly needing to help them solve the challenge, that may mean the current method is too complicated. Remember it’s better to start simple and then slowly make things harder for your bird. This helps ensure your bird’s safety as introducing your bird to a foraging method that is too complicated or inappropriate can lead to strangulation hazards, toxic ingestion, and foreign body ingestion. To avoid these risks, supervision and researching your specific foraging method beforehand are critical. Your veterinarian is an excellent resource you can consult with. Techniques Scattering and Hiding Food Scattering food outside the cage instead of keeping it all in one or two easily accessible bowls, while you stand by, is a straightforward way to encourage foraging. Designating a space outside the cage to do so can help maintain cleanliness while encouraging foraging. One step up from this is scattering food in natural materials like leaf litter, straw or paper, so your bird has to dig for it. Adding wooden blocks or other obstacles increases the challenge and work involved. You can also have multiple food bowls around the cage, some with and some without food. Occasionally rotating which bowl has what keeps birds on their toes as they have to check all the bowls. You can partially or fully cover food bowls with newspaper or cardboard, so your bird has to chew their way through it. It may be necessary to punch a starter hole so your bird learns to chew through the barrier to get the food. You can also mix food with inedible items such as wood beads, plastic bottle caps, and shredded paper. Make sure the inedible items are large enough to not be swallowed and do not pose a risk. Some birds, especially parrots, really like shredding and destroying items, the remnants of which may be swallowed and become hazardous. Supervise your bird to prevent swallowing. Finally, you can try wrapping individual food items in pieces of paper, corn husks or other materials. Twisting the ends can make it more challenging for your bird. Puzzle Feeders Another way to hide food is to use puzzle feeders. These are devices that hold food and must be manipulated in different ways to release the food. There are many different types available with varying degrees of difficulty. Be sure to research whatever products you are considering paying particular attention to safety. Alternate between Reward and No Reward Not all foraging efforts should be met with a reward. In the initial phases of learning these skills, birds should be kept motivated through consistent rewards. Later in the process, however, keep your bird engaged by alternating which toys, bowls, or other foraging tools have food and which don’t. When suited to your bird, continual challenge and novelty are great ways to mentally and physically engage your bird. The goal is to encourage your bird to explore many foraging avenues and not just rush to the one with their favorite food item. Accordingly, try to match how valued the reward is with how difficult it is to get it. Your bird may be more motivated to continue working harder and longer for their favorite treat than for a less valued item. However, giving your bird treats or food items that are not part of their regular diet should be infrequent and should not undermine their overall diet. It’s easy to overfeed your bird with high-calorie treats; monitoring food intake and body weight with a scale are good ways to avoid weight gain. Foraging Perch or Tree A foraging perch is a piece of non-treated wood drilled with holes into which food items can fit in tightly. There are many types of perches, but the point is that the food reward is easily visible but not accessible unless your bird chews through the wood. A foraging tree, on the other hand, is several steps up. Like a perch, a foraging tree can have holes in it to hide food, but it also offers many opportunities to hang different food puzzles and toys. Your bird will have to navigate the tree and its branches to get from puzzle to puzzle, which can be randomly filled with different food rewards and no rewards. These trees can be made of lumber, sticks, PVC pipe, or rope and can either be purchased or hand-made. While foraging trees can be excellent tools, they require a lot of space and are more expensive, so they are not the best fit for everyone. Ask your veterinarian for recommendations if you believe a foraging tree may work for you. Foraging Toys (Tools) There are many options when it comes to foraging toys. However, just because something is marketed as a suitable foraging toy for birds does not mean it will work for your bird. Some factors to consider are safety, available cage space, and difficulty. You want a toy suited for your bird’s current skill set that poses no risk of injury. If there is a risk, it may be better to go with another foraging toy or always supervise your bird when they are using it. How Practical is Foraging? Providing your bird with foraging opportunities is an ongoing process. There is no stopping point. Foraging helps meet your bird’s need for on-going mental stimulation, exactly like food, water, and social interaction. As your bird becomes proficient at one method, they may need further challenge to stay engaged. You will need to dedicate some time and creativity into finding new ways to help your bird forage, especially initially. While it may take some time to figure out what works best, the aim is to eventually develop a routine with enough variability to keep your bird engaged. When exploring foraging options, it’s essential to consider how much space you have, how much time your bird is left alone, and whether they need supervision with some foraging methods. Finding ways to incorporate foraging into your bird’s daily lifestyle that works for both of you will make the experience enjoyable and exciting for everyone involved.

Category: Parrot Nutrition
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Long gone are the days when it was considered appropriate to feed pet parrots nothing but seeds and human food. Seeds are essentially junk food for birds. They are relatively high in fat and low in essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamins A and D, calcium, and certain amino acids. Not only is a steady diet of seeds not healthy for a bird, it can cause disease in the long run. As such, it is now felt that seeds are good for treats and training aids, but not for the main course. Birds who eat well are healthier, live longer, have higher activity levels, and enjoy better plumage than birds who eat a poor diet. The mainstay of a pet bird’s diet (approximately 80% of the food consumed) should be a premium commercial pellet supplemented with vegetables and a small amount of fruit. The pellets themselves are made of vegetables, fruits, grains and seeds. Because all the ingredients are mixing together during the manufacturing process, birds can’t pick out their favorite items and as such won’t develop nutritional imbalances. Pellets are available to suit any pet bird now as they come in many sizes and varieties. While providing significantly improved nutrition compared to seeds, pellets are also superior to fresh produce as they can be easily stored without fear of decay. Occasionally sharing some of your healthy food is good for your bird’s health both from a nutritional point of view as well as for bonding and training. That being said, it’s important not to offer food that has been in or near your mouth or take food that has been in your parrot’s mouth. As stated above, commercial pellets are an excellent base that should be supplemented with a variety of vegetables and sparing amounts of fruit. However, your bird will also benefit from and enjoy moderate amounts (less than 10% of total amount eaten daily) of healthily prepared pasta, beans, eggs, brown rice, pine nuts, and some unsalted nuts such as almonds, Brazil nuts, walnuts and macadamia; however, beware the high fat content of most nuts. The amounts of these feeds that are appropriate to feed vary by species of bird, age and health status, so it’s best to check with your veterinarian about the specific amounts for your pet. While it’s often tempting, avoid feeding peanuts as well as processed, salty, fatty, or sugary foods. These items can have serious long-term health effects for your bird. In the wild birds spend many hours seeking food and water, and interacting with members of the flock. In our homes they usually spend very little time looking for food, and often their flock members (humans) are out of the house for many hours of the day. As such, I recommend that you work towards incorporating captive foraging into your bird's life. In this process, birds have to work for their food via the use of various home-made and commercial foraging toys. This will increase the bird's active time during the day and decrease therisk of certain behavioral problems. Vitamin A Birds require vitamin A to keep their immune systems strong. Vitamin A helps prevent bacterial infections, and yet vitamin A deficiency is unfortunately all too common in pet birds.  Birds without enough vitamin A don’t have enough protective mucous lining their respiratory tract and are less able to fight off bacteria and fungi. The sinus cavity and respiratory systems are the most common places for these infections.  Signs of bacterial infections include sneezing, difficulty breathing, nasal discharge, swelling around the eyes and cere, lethargy, inappetence, weight loss, and bad breath. Lack of vitamin A can also affect other vital organ systems such as the bowel and kidneys. Before pellets were readily available, it was commonplace to supplement birds’ diets with a powder or liquid vitamin A. However, this approach was only variably effective owing to breakdown of the vitamin and unreliable consumption of the vitamin by the birds. Supplementation is unnecessary, and may be dangerous, for birds whose base food is a balanced and fortified pellet; it is yet another reason to work towards converting your bird to a pelleted diet. In addition to the vitamin A provided in pellets, you will also be providing supplementation when you feed your bird fresh vegetables with vitamin A, such as: the dark leafy greens like broccoli, kale, dandelions, and spinach (although spinach should be given in limited amounts) as well as carrots and yams. Egg yolks and fresh or dried chili peppers also have significant amounts of vitamin A. Most birds like scrambled eggs, and frozen vegetables that don’t have spices or added ingredients are an easy way to give your bird vegetables. Remember to keep the amount of egg fed to a minimum as egg yolks are high in fat and cholesterol. Foods to Avoid While our birds can eat much of what we eat, in limited amounts, some of the items that your bird should not have are: In addition to avoiding the above foods, all fresh fruits and vegetables should be thoroughly washed, as for human consumption, to reduce the risk of infection with bacteria such asE. coliorSalmonella.

Category: Backyard Chickens Cause Human Health Risks
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says owners of backyard chickens and other poultry should be made aware of the risks these animals pose to humans, and take basic steps to prevent disease transmission.  I suspect many of you who live in rural areas, and many in urban settings in which cities allow chickens, have backyard poultry; owners need to understand that these birds can spreadSalmonella, Campylobacterand avian influenza to humans.  Numerous human infections ofSalmonellahave been linked to contact with backyard chickens, and these especially occur in children younger than 5 years of age, pregnant women, and people over 65, as all of these groups may have decreased immunity.  Symptoms ofSalmonellaandCampylobacterinclude diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps but symptoms may be more severe if the infection enters the blood stream; in those cases, hospitalization may be required. Avian influenza viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can easily spread and infect domestic poultry; birds can carry the virus in saliva, mucous and feces.  Avian influenza can also infect humans and symptoms can be mild to severe.  Symptoms in people are typical of other flu viruses and cause fever, cough, sore throat, nasal discharge, muscle and body aches, nausea and vomiting.  Preventing disease transmission from poultry to humans involves thorough hand washing with soap, or hand sanitizer if you are unable to wash.  Poultry should certainly not be allowed to enter homes, and owners should designate a pair of shoes only to be worn in the poultry area and not worn in the house.  Children less than 5 should be kept away from poultry. Food and drink should not be consumed in areas where poultry live.

Category: Common Bacterial Diseases in Backyard Chickens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English They’re adorable. They’re fluffy. They’re organic.Whether as pets or as a food source,backyard chickensare increasingly popular. All sorts of folks, particularly those in or near large cities, are exploring the joys backyard chickens have to offer, often for the first time. While keeping and caring for chickens is exciting, it is also a serious responsibility. Just as cats and dogs can get sick with various diseases, so can chickens. One of the many causes that can make chickens sick are bacteria. Chickens as Food Animals Regardless of whether your birds or their eggs are consumed, chickens are considered food animals and are subject to federal and state regulations. When a chicken is sick, some of the medications your veterinarian can prescribe may have a drug withdrawal period. This means you will have to wait to eat eggs, meat, and other biproducts during treatment and for a period after treatment ends to make sure there are not any drug residues in what you are eating. You must keep this in mind if your birds are treated for a bacterial disease. Your veterinarian will give you a drug withdrawal period. As an owner, this means if your birds test positive for particular infectious diseases, a state veterinarian may visit and evaluate your flock. Restrictions and regulations vary by state, but some state veterinarians have the authority to order a depopulation (euthanasia) of flocks for public health reasons.  Bacterial diseases that can cause federal agencies to get involved includeSalmonella pullorum, Salmonella gallinarum(fowl typhoid), and sometimesMycoplasmas. Disease Prevention Strategies Taking proper care of chickens requires extensive attention and should be thoroughly understoodbeforeyou decide to bring chickens home. There are general steps you can take to prevent bacterial disease in your backyard flock, including proper husbandry and biosecurity practices. Examples of good husbandry that can reduce the likelihood of bacterial diseases include proper nutrition, clean and fresh water, suitable housing with adequate ventilation, and plenty of space for each chicken. All of these measures help reduce stress and make your birds less susceptible to disease. Biosecurity is the measures you take to prevent introducing and spreading diseases. Some measures are wearing clothing and shoes that you only wear when working with the flock, obtaining birds from known disease-free flocks, and having a separate isolation area for quarantine and sick animals, and separating age groups. One effective way to prevent bacterial diseases is by purchasing birds and chicks from a reputable, disease-free source, such as buying birds from flocks that are certified by theNational Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP). The NPIP program provides monitoring and testing for a number of infectious diseases includingSalmonellaspecies, Mycoplasmaspecies,and avian influenza. Poultry farms can be NPIP-certified for each specific disease, and all birds (and breeders producing eggs and chicks) being sold across state lines must be certified negative forSalmonellapullorum/typhoid and avian influenza before transport.  If you want birds that are negative forMycoplasma, the flock must be certified for eachMycoplasmaspecies. Sourcing your birds from certified flocks is a great way to prevent disease, and prevention is always easier than treatment since many bacterial diseases in poultry cannot be cured. Treatment For the majority of chicken bacterial diseases, treatment involves antibiotics. They can be given in the water or with pills (there are other ways that are impractical for flocks of less than 500). How they are given depends on the specific disease and which method is most practical. While treatment can help resolve symptoms in your birds, many chicken bacterial infections can never be cured. These birds that no longer show symptoms become carriers, and will be able to spread the bacteria to other uninfected birds. This carrier status is common among chicken bacterial diseases and there are several options if your birds fall into this category. One option is depopulation of your flock. Combined with proper sanitation of the environment, this option allows for complete eradication of the bacterial disease affecting your chickens. Many backyard chicken owners are more than reluctant to pursue this option. Thankfully, there are alternatives. Another option is to treat your birds for the disease, and accept that your flock will be persistently infected, and may need to be treated multiple times as symptoms reoccur. In these cases, you will need to work with your veterinarian to keep your birds healthy and reduce symptoms. Depending on the disease, you may be required to inform anyone about the bacteria the chickens carry to whomever comes into contact with your chickens or their products. If you decide to keep infected birds, your flock should remain closed. This means birds should not enter or leave the flock. If chicks are not allowed to hatch, eventually your birds will naturally die off. Once this happens, the environment can be cleaned and you can get birds that you know are disease free. Alternatively, there are vaccines against some of the bacterial diseases that can be given to new chickens you want to integrate into your closed and infected flock. These vaccines often do not prevent infection, but do prevent symptoms. Talk with your veterinarian about what options work best for your flock since treatment often does not cure. Bacterial Diseases See charts 1 and 2 for a summary of each disease. Note:Mycoplasmaspecies are not technically bacteria but are similar and thus the diseases they cause are listed here. Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD)-Mycoplasma gallisepticum Mycoplasma gallisepticumis a common chronic and mild disease in chickens.Symptoms include coughing, lung noises, sneezing, nasal discharge, eye discharge, and facial swelling. Younger birds are more severely affected and can show signs of stunted growth and, in some cases, death. Chickens can become infected and spread CRD through direct contact with infected or carrier birds, contact with contaminated equipment, or from hen to chick. It can be diagnosed by submitting samples for testing. Treatment is with antibiotics although it is not curative and only treats clinical signs.  Birds remain carriers for life, and can spread the disease to other birds and their offspring. Infectious Coryza Infectious coryza is caused byAvibacterium paragallinarum,and occurs in all age groups but most commonly occurs in semi-mature to adult birds.  Coryza is usually seen in situations where the area is never emptied of chickens. This disease has a rapid onset, but once it is established in a flock, the remaining birds become carriers for life, even if they do not show any symptoms. Symptoms may include swelling of the face around the eyes and sometimes the wattles, sneezing, nasal and eye discharge, pink eye, swollen sinuses, and sometimes lower respiratory infections. Introducing infected or carrier birds causes it in a flock. Treatment options include depopulation or antibiotics but recovered birds will remain carriers. If chickens with this disease are kept and replacement birds are added to the flock, there is a vaccine available that can be given to incoming birds but that is only feasible for large flocks, not backyard chickens. Fowl Cholera Fowl cholera is caused byPasteurella multocida,with mature chickens being more susceptible to disease than younger birds. Chickens can become infected by carriers that are not showing symptoms, wild birds, predators, rodents, pigs, cats, and contaminated equipment and environments. Symptoms range from difficulty breathing, fever, reduced appetite, reduced egg production, rapid weight loss and sudden death to swollen face, wattles, and swollen joints. Antibiotic treatment can be given for confirmed diagnoses, although your birds will likely remain carriers. A vaccine is available and can be used in regions where fowl cholera is common, but that is not a substitute for good sanitary practices. Rodent control and preventing your flock from associating with wild birds is important in preventing fowl cholera. Infectious Synovitis Infectious synovitis is caused byMycoplasma synoviaeand can affect birds in two ways: Chickens can show either signs of respiratory disease or lameness. This disease can spread through the egg from hen to chick, direct contact, respiratory particles over short distances, and by indirect contacts, such as on equipment or a person’s clothing. Treatment by antibiotics is used to reduce symptoms, which often come back again after treatment is finished. Once a flock has the disease, they are carriers for life. Breeding flocks can be certified NPIP negative, so acquiring from certified negative flocks is ideal. Botulism Botulism is caused byClostridium botulinumand can affect birds of any age. Chickens become exposed by ingesting contaminated food, water, carcasses, maggots, decaying organic material, and sometimes bugs. Depending on the amount of toxin ingested, symptoms can range from dullness and sleepiness to paralysis of the legs, wings and neck and death within 12-24 hours. To treat and prevent botulism in your birds, focus on eliminating potential sources of toxin production by removing all dead animals immediately, controlling fly and insect populations, and preventing access to decaying organic matter. Birds should not be given food and water by mouth until they are able to lift their head up. Vitamins and antibiotics are reported to reduce death rates. Antitoxin is available but it is difficult to get and expensive. In areas exposure to botulism is high, there is a vaccine available Pullorum Disease In the U.S.,Salmonella pullorumhas been eradicated by those participating in NPIP but can be found in other countries. Pullorum disease is caused bySalmonella pullorumand is highly fatal to young chicks. Adult birds may or may not show unthriftiness, but spread theSalmonellathrough the egg to chicks. The infected chicks then spread theSalmonellato the other chicks. Often eggs have decreased hatchability, and clincal signs in chicks include weakness, lack of appetite, sleepiness, sudden death, a higher mortality around 4-5 days old, droopiness, chilled appearance and huddling under heat sources, and white diarrhea with a “pasted-down” appearance around the vent. After a week of age, birds that inhaled the organisms in the hatcher may show respiratory signs. The number of deaths peaks around 2-3 weeks of age. Birds that survive are irregular in size, unthrifty, stunted, or poorly feathered. Pullorum disease can get into your flock through direct contact with carrier chickens, contamination of equipment and from hen to chick. Once your birds are affected, they will be carriers for the rest of their lives. Prevention includes purchasing birds and eggs from NPIP-certified flocks or similar eradication programs. Fowl Typhoid Fowl typhoid has also been eradicated in the U.S. It is caused bySalmonella gallinarumand while chickens of any age can be affected, it primarily occurs in young adults older than 12 weeks of age. It can get into your flock through direct contact with contamination of equipment, carrier chickens, and from hen to chick. Signs of illness include sudden death (sometimes sporadic), listlessness, yellow diarrhea, loss of appetite, and a pale, anemic appearance of comb and wattles. Prevention includes purchasing birds and eggs from NPIP-certified flocks or similar eradication programs. Paratyphoid Paratyphoid is caused by a type ofSalmonellaand affects mainly young birds. Signs of illness are similar to those seen with pullorum disease and include anorexia, diarrhea and reduced egg production. However, chickens are often asymptomatic so your birds may seem unaffected despite harboring this bacterium. Treatment and prevention are similar to those for fowl typhoid. Necrotic Enteritis Necrotic enteritis is caused byClostridium perfringensand most heavily affects chickens 2-12 weeks of age. If your flock is affected you may see birds become acutely depressed and die within hours or dark, often blood-stained diarrhea, reduced appetite and weight loss. Birds become infected by eating contaminated fecal matter, soil and other material. Unlike other diseases, treatment with antibiotics will resolve this disease in your chickens. In addition, your veterinarian may recommend supportive vitamin treatment to enhance the effectiveness of the antibiotics. Necrotic enteritis tends to occur more frequently in overcrowded, immuno-suppressed flocks so good husbandry and management are particularly important in prevention. Part of this husbandry involves having an effective deworming protocol as coccidiosis may be a contributing factor. Salpingitis Salpingitis (inflammation of the tube through which the eggs pass) has many causes, some of which do not involve bacteria. When bacteria are involved though, it is usuallyE. coli. Salpingitis is common in older birds and affected hens may show signs of decreased egg production, a distended stomach, and difficulty walking. Your chickens cannot spread this disease to each other as it is mostly caused by changes in their reproductive system related to age. As a result, this is no way to prevent salpingitis. You can, however, still treat your birds with antibiotics if they become infected. Your chickens may need surgery to remove their tube to completely resolve this issue. Bumblefoot Bumblefoot is a common condition among backyard poultry typically complicated by secondary bacterial infections, particularlyStaphylococcusspecies. If any of your chickens develop bumblefoot, it could be due to pressure necrosis (in which pressure restricts the flow of blood, causing the skin tissue to die) from inappropriate footing, trauma, and abnormal posture and weight bearing. The effects of pressure necrosis are especially important if your chickens are obese as this increases the compression of the soft tissue structures in their feet. If affected, you may see a progression of signs. Initially, less severe signs include redness of the foot followed by swelling, pain, and in severe cases, loss of function. Depending on the degree your chickens are affected, treatment ranges from foot soaks and pressure-relieving bandages to surgery. Prevention goes a long way in terms of bumblefoot and includes an appropriate diet, proper footing and perches, and good drainage of the chicken coop to avoid wet or muddy ground. Colibacillosis Colibacillosis is caused byE. coliand can affect chickens of all ages in many ways. Depending on the body system affected, you may see signs of respiratory distress, GI signs like diarrhea, or sudden death. Diagnosis of colibacillosis can be difficult as many strains ofE. coliare normal inhabitants of your chickens’ intestinal tracts and do not cause disease. Thus, your veterinarian will need to look at the entire picture as well as laboratory results since a positive test does not necessarily meanE. coliis responsible. If your chickens are suffering from colibacillosis, treatment options include antibiotics but these have variable success. Preventing this disease focuses heavily on proper management and sanitation practices and reducing stress factors that make your birds more susceptible to infection. Examples of these practices include adequate ventilation, good litter and range conditions, and properly cleaned facilities. If you have any questions, contact your veterinarian. Chart 1: Common Bacterial Diseases and Symptoms  Disease Bacterial Agent(s) Primary Body System Affected Symptoms Chronic Respiratory Disease/Mycoplasmosis Mycoplasma gallisepticum Respiratory Coughing, discharge around the eyes and nose, facial swelling, unthriftiness Infectious Coryza Avibacterium paragallinarum Respiratory Difficulty breathing, facial swelling around eyes and wattles, swollen sinuses, hallmark foul-smelling, sticky discharge around eyes and nose and decreased egg production Fowl Cholera/ Pasteurellosis Pasteurella multocida Respiratory Inflammation of the conjunctiva and sinuses (redness, swelling, pain, increased heat), swelling and darkening (cyanosis) of the face and wattles, loss of appetite, stupor, rapid weight loss, lameness, difficulty breathing, watery yellowish or green diarrhea Infectious Synovitis Mycoplasma synoviae Respiratory and Musculoskeletal Lameness followed by lethargy, reluctance to move, swollen joints, stilted gait, weight loss, and breast blisters.

Can range from listlessness, ruffled feathers, fever, labored breathing, and diarrhea to sudden death. Diseases marked with an * can be caused by other non-bacterial factors too. Bumblefoot** is not caused by bacteria but secondary bacterial infections are common. Chart 2: Treatment and Prevention  Disease (body system affected) Treatment Prevention Chronic Respiratory Disease/Mycoplasmosis Antibiotic therapy but birds will remain carriers for life Obtain birds from knownMycoplasma-free flocks or depopulate flock and repopulate with clean stock. Infectious Coryza Antibiotic therapy but birds remain carriers for life Vaccine available; multiple doses required. Fowl Cholera/ Pasteurellosis Prolonged antibiotic therapy but birds remain carriers for life Vaccination through use of bacterins. Infectious Synovitis Antibiotic therapy with injectables most effective Obtain birds only from NPIP-certified flocks. Botulism Mildly affected birds separated and given mild laxatives, water into crop twice daily, and Epsom salts mixed into feed. Antitoxin available but very expensive. Eliminate sources of toxin production by prompt removal of all dead animals, controlling fly and insect populations and avoid access to decaying organic matter. Pullorum Disease/ Salmonellosis/ “White Diarrhea” Eradicated in the U.S. Obtain birds only from NPIP-certified disease-free flocks or similar eradication programs. Fowl Typhoid Eradicated in the U.S. Obtain birds only from NPIP-certified disease-free flocks or similar eradication programs. Paratyphoid Similar to fowl typhoid Similar to fowl typhoid Necrotic Enteritis/ Rot gut Antibiotic therapy. Supportive vitamin treatment may enhance effectiveness.

Category: Enrichment for Backyard Birds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   Chickens, ducks, geese, and other “backyard birds” can be quite social and be wonderful pets. They need appropriate predator-proof housing, medical care, food, water, and enrichment. Enrichment helps your birds to thrive mentally and physically, and different species of birds may have their own unique enrichment needs. Dirt Baths Chickens not only enjoy a dust or dirt bath but need it for good health. This activity reduces parasites on the feathers, keeps them cooler, and helps to distribute natural oils through the preening process during these baths. If a natural dirt hole does not exist, you can make one using a low-sided kitty litter pan with added sand or dirt which does not have any added fertilizer or chemicals. The litter pan needs to be big enough for large breed chickens like Bielfelders or Jersey Giant to get their bodies down in the dirt. Snuffle Mats, Snuffle Balls, and Dog Puzzle Bowls Ducks and chickens can both forage in snuffle mats. This is a great option when the ground is frozen. Black soldier fly larvae, mealworms, berries, and seeds can be sprinkled in asnuffle mat. In warmer months, snuffle mats can be made of grass. If your chicken run does not have grass, then you can grow oat grass in trays. When the grass reaches one to two inches tall, sprinkle in treats and give the tray to your birds. They will forage for the treats, eat the grass, and dig in the dirt which are all normal bird behaviors. Dog puzzle bowls and snuffle balls can be filled with snacks or food so that birds can forage. Birds also enjoy chasing and rolling the balls around. Herb Planters Plant perennial herbs like mint, thyme, and oregano in planter boxes. Once they are well established, you can place them in your chicken run. Put chicken wire over the boxes so that the birds can get to the plants but not dig in the dirt. Hanging Food Activity Kale leaves hanging from clothes pins can create a fun foraging activity for birds. Cabbage heads or homemade suet-type blocks can be suspended. The birds will stretch and hop up to get the treats, just like they would naturally jump at low-hanging branches. Kiddie Pools for Ducks and Other Waterfowl Ducks love the water and need it for good health and grooming. Providing a kiddie pool for swimming can be great entertainment for the ducks. Ducks will swim even in cold weather. Deeper pools give ducks an opportunity to dive under the water but be sure to provide them with a ramp or other safe access in and out of the water. Buckets and Other Water Sources When a pool is not an option, buckets can be used so your ducks can fully submerge their head daily. This is not just enriching for the duck but also needed for good health and grooming. Foraging for food in water Ducks enjoy foraging for food in water. Sprinkle berries, peas, insects, sprouts, or vegetable peels in a deep dish or pool. Waterfowl maintenance food, sold commercially, floats on the water and can be fed daily to ducks and other waterfowl as their regular diet. Exploring If given the space, chickens and ducks can cover a lot of ground in a day, foraging for insects and plants along the way. While many ducks and chickens can live in small spaces, they should still have opportunities to explore and forage safely. If possible, allow for free-ranging times when you can monitor them or create a “chicken tractor” to allow the birds to safely move from one area to the next. Clicker Training Chickens and ducks can be clicker trained. Teach them to hop up on a platform, to target an object with their beak, or to come when called. Roosting Chickens and Muscovy ducks will typically roost at night in the coop. This provides a safe and draft-free place to sleep. When given the option, many will also roost during the day in their run. Covered Outside Space A covered run gives your birds space for enrichment opportunities year-round, regardless of the weather. Keep snuffle mats, dust baths, and other enrichment items dry and safe from bad weather. Greenhouse plastic on the roof and sides helps keep this space warm while hardware cloth keeps your birds safe from predators. Birds are natural problem solvers and enjoy interacting with enrichment activities. By providing enrichment and meeting their specific needs, backyard birds can be a wonderful addition to your family. You may be surprised by how much personality they have.

Category: Environmental Enrichment for Birds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English More than 20 million pet birds live in the United States; birds are adored for their beautiful appearances, extraordinary personalities, and unique behaviors. As we continue to make more progress toward understanding some of the medical and behavioral challenges associated with taking care of birds, one particular area of interest for bird owners is environmental enrichment. Boredom and the stress associated with the inability to perform natural behaviors are common challenges associated with bringing animals into our homes because they rely heavily on their natural instincts. Our goal for the birds in captivity should be to replicate their natural history and environment as much as possible in captivity to avoid the development of major social, behavioral, and physiological issues. For instance, research indicates that the intelligence of Psittacines is comparable to that of a 3-5 year old human child, so they deserve a similar level of stimulation and socialization throughout their day to day routines to ensure appropriate development and quality of life. Without environmental enrichment, a bird’s boredom may progress to stress and changes in behavior. Some common causes of stress in captive animals include restrictive enclosures, suboptimal nutrition, the reduced or restricted ability to exercise, inadequate habitat, and a lack of mental stimulation. As with humans, there are often predictable signs and behaviors observed in captive animals that we associate with stress and boredom, and as owners and clinicians, our challenge is to learn to understand these signs within our avian friends so we can intervene whenever they arise. Some common behaviors that may indicate stress or boredom in pet birds include self-destructive behavior, feather picking, open-beak breathing, fearful or aggressive behaviors, trembling, and excessive vocalization and screaming. If your veterinarian isn't comfortable working with these issues, see an avian specialist. Although experiencing some level of stress or boredom is normal for any species, giving our pets the option to expand their mental, physical, and behavioral repertoire is a great first step to ensuring they maintain a happy, healthy lifestyle. Environmental enrichment is a means to provide pet birds in captivity with the ability to express natural behavior, such as foraging, exploration, exercise, etc. Some of the most common themes for enrichment that we focus on with pet Psittacines include: providing opportunities to exhibit foraging behavior, investigation of novel items, destroying/manipulating items (like tearing up a phone book or newspaper), social interaction, the opportunity to exercise (climb, fly, etc.), and puzzles to manipulate. There are many different options when it comes to empowering our pets through enrichment, and a little creativity will serve you well. Some items for enrichment can be bought at a store, but most enrichment can be done through using what you already have at home. Here are a few ideas to get you started, but the sky is the limit when it comes to what you can offer. Target training is a technique that can be used to modify behaviors through operant conditioning, which involves the use of positive reinforcement (rewards) to shape desirable behaviors and eliminate undesirable ones. This technique is a great way to challenge these highly intelligent animals to learn new things while also developing a strong social bond with their owners. While developing these enrichment tools and strategies, it is important to evaluate their safety and potential hazards that could be associated with them. You should always assess and eliminate potential risks of strangulation (neck, legs, extremities), toxicities, ingestion of objects, and injury before implementing enrichment tools and ideas. It is also important to observe your bird using their enrichment tools to ensure that they are safe and able to effectively stimulate your bird. Just like humans, birds express their emotions through specific signs and behaviors. As we continue to learn to better understand them, we can take steps to improve the mental, physical, and emotional health of our companions through the use of environmental enrichment. Enrichment does not have to be extravagant or expensive. It can be as simple as providing a paper towel roll to push around their enclosure or changing the location of things that are already inside of their living space. Creativity and variety are the keys to success when it comes to keeping our pets stimulated. There are a variety of online resources that you can consult for ideas, including theAmerican Association of Zoo Keepers guidelines to environmental enrichment.Maintaining the health and happiness of our pets is always a top priority as owners, and incorporating environmental enrichment into your bird’s daily routine is a simple and effective way to ensure that their quality of life never stops improving.

Category: Top Ten Ways to Keep your Bird Safe from Kitchen Dangers
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Companion avians are extra sensitive to what's going on in the air. Whatever they inhale goes to all parts of their bodies very quickly. This sensitivity, coupled with their small size, makes it especially dangerous for birds to breathe in cooking fumes and eat some of the foods and plants that are commonly found in kitchens. ASPCA experts urge bird parents to heed the following precautions in order to prevent curious beaks from getting caught in dangerous situations. For a further list, check out ourtoxic plantpages. Much of the information there is pertinent for birds, as well as dogs, cats, and horses. Remember, if you think your bird has ingested or come in contact with a potentially toxic substance, call your veterinarian or the ASPCA. To reach the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, call (888) 426-4435. For more information, visit the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center online. Tips on cooking safety were provided by Karen Rosenthal, DVM, MS. Extra Tips The following items can also be toxic to your bird: Hairsprays, perfumes, insecticidal fumigants, pesticide sprays, automobile exhausts, and fumes from glue and paint. The ASPCANational Animal Poison Controlis available 24 hours a day at 888-426-4435. Expect an initial consultation fee of around $100.00 and additional follow-up is at no charge.

Category: Balancing your Parrot's Lifestyle
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We can all relate to the importance of balance. A balanced diet, a balanced checkbook, and a balanced lifestyle are important to our well-being. Birds also need balance in their life. Balanced nutrition is an important cornerstone of care. Equally important is balanced activity and behavioral enrichment to allow them to engage with others and with their environment. What are the Elements of a Balanced Lifestyle? There are three primary elements to a parrot’s daily life: Nutrition, social interaction, and maintenance behaviors. Nutrition and foraging refers to the make-up of the diet and the time and energy involved in finding, extracting, eating, and processing food. Social interaction includes time spent in a flock setting vocalizing, preening, flying, and displaying. Maintenance activities include all the things that a bird has to do to maintain its physical health outside of eating, such as sleeping, preening, and bathing. Once these areas have been satisfied, there are additional behaviors and activities that take place on an annual cycle, such as reproduction, molt, or, in some cases, migration. However, if the three basic categories occupy most of a bird’s time and energy, the annual activities, particularly reproduction, may not take place at all. It comes down to budgeting of time, nutrients, availability of mates or nests, etc. This is the first step to recognizing how we can change a pet bird’s behavior through manipulation of the environment, diet, and our social interaction with them. Getting Off Balance In a wild setting, birds work hard most of the time to find food, watch for danger, and take care of themselves. A natural equilibrium becomes established, which may or may not allow for extra activites. In captivity, basic needs are met easily and so there is an enormous surplus of time and energy intake and a minimal amount of physical activity required. This extra time and dietary energy can be utilized for breeding even if the other required elements, such as a mate or nest site, are minimally available. For many captive parrots, this is enough to be reproductively active on a continuous basis, often without being able to ever complete the cycle and enter a phase of rest and repair. Because physiological changes for breeding are so intensive, it is believed that birds that are constantly in this condition are prone to a variety of medical and psychological illnesses. Resulting medical conditions include osteodystrophy (loss of bone calcium), hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver), egg coelomitis (inflammation of the abdomen from internally ovulating), oviductal or ovarian cancer and cysts, egg binding, cloacitis (inflammation or infection of the cloaca), cloacal prolapse, and stroke. Undesired behaviors that can result include feather or skin destructive behaviors (feather picking/plucking), obsessive compulsive behaviors, territorially defensive behaviors, and screaming or other attention-getting behaviors (e.g., separation anxiety). Birds that do not enter breeding condition, but still cannot satisfy their needs for activity, mental exercise, or social interaction, can also exhibit some of these problem behaviors. At the very minimum, birds that are not allowed to achieve lifestyle balance probably experience more stress and do not behave and interact with their human flock to their full potential. Social Interaction Most wild parrots are social creatures except, perhaps, when they pair up and concentrate on raising young. Commonly the birds will spend brief periods of time allopreening (preening the feathers on eachothers’ heads) or otherwise interacting and vocalizing with a flock. These flocks can be very noisy and active. As our birds’ surrogate flock, we need to fulfill this role without inadvertantly taking on the role of mate. Talking, dancing, training, and playing games with your bird are excellent ways to fulfill your bird’s need for social interaction. Even just having your bird nearby on a perch, stand, or travel cage, wherever you are at the time, is good quality time. To avoid the impression that you are a willing mate, avoid prolonged cuddling, allopreening, or perching on your shoulder. To a parrot, these can suggest a more intimate interest. Nutrition and Foraging This cornerstone of daily activity includes the search for food and the act of extracting, eating, and processing it. This can occupy as much as 6-18 hours of a wild parrot’s day. The activity of foraging also engages the bird’s mind as it flies, takes in all of the sensory information, watches for predators, learns from its flock members, and concentrates on discovering, manipulating, and extracting food items. In contrast, a pet parrot may only spend 20-30 minutes a day simply eating out of a bowl in isolation from others. During periods when social interaction is limited, as is often the case when we, the surrogate flockmates, are away earning a living, other maintenance behaviors such as foraging and feather care should be increased to fill the time. This in turn may be very beneficial as a part of behavioral modification treatments for abnormal behaviors such as feather picking, screaming, or pair-bonding behaviors. There are three keys to successfully teaching your bird to forage: Diet, starting simple, and consistency. Foraging rewards should be tiny pieces of extra special food that is not present in the regular diet. For most parrots, the basic diet should be limited to pellets and vegetables, thus freeing items like fruit, pasta, Cheerios, whole-grain crackers or other non-fatty people foods for use (sparingly) in training and foraging. Listed below are some basic foraging ideas. Remember to start easy if your bird has never foraged. On a daily basis, assemble, play with, and disassemble foraging items in front of your bird at first as they may not even understand that food can be concealed. Once they understand that rewards are involved, they will begin exploring and learning on their own. You are the surrogate flock so your bird will be naturally interested in whatever you show interest in on a regular basis. As your bird masters a particular technique, you can begin to randomize rewards, increase difficulty, and combine techniques. For example, every foraging device may have a tasty nut piece as first but later you can hide pellets or beads or toys instead. For combination, you could place wrapped items in a bowl that is itself wrapped with cardboard. Interestingly, the increased difficulty and less consistent reward can actually increase your bird’s drive to forage as they search harder for that desired reward. Give these techniques a try: Foraging perchA piece of non-treated wood (e.g., pine lumber) drilled with holes into which rewards fit tightly. The reward should be visible but not accessible without chewing down through the wood. This perch material can be used with your training perch, when the bird is outside of the cage with you. The wood can also be used as a perch in the cage, or even hung in the cage to increase the challenge. Wrapping food bowlsWrap the food bowls with paper or cardboard so that your bird has to spend time chewing in to get at the food. You may have to teach your bird the first time by punching a starter hole, or simulating the foraging activity yourself, acquiring your bird’s favorite food item, and not sharing it with the bird after you find it. Treat wadsYou can individually wrap rewards in small pieces of paper, corn husks, snowcone cups or Dixie cups, or other materials. Not all wrappings need to contain a reward, either. Buried treasuresPellets or more valued rewards can be mixed in with wood buttons, dry beans, or other items so that the bird has to dig through to find its food. Some parrot species, such as grey parrots, can be particularly stimulated into new foraging behaviors by having a “sandbox” and buried treasures provided. Commercially-available toysThere are a variety of toys available that require birds to unscrew parts or manipulate components to get at their reward. See the Resources list at the end of this packet for ideas on where you can find commercially available foraging toys. Remember that you can gradually increase the difficulty by stuffing the toy with wrapped food items, sticks, or other clean debris. Foraging treeA “tree” complete with challenging foraging stations can be made of lumber, sticks, plastic pipe, or rope. See the Resource section at the end of this handout to learn where you can acquire the DVD “Captive Foraging,” which demonstrates how to build and train your bird to use a foraging tree. Trick trainingBy asking your bird to perform a desired behavior for a reward, you are, in essence, providing a modified foraging activity for your bird. In addition, you are also having a lot of fun, and are satisfying your bird’s need for social interaction. See the Training section later in this handout and check out the training opportunities in the Resources list at the end of this handout. Maintenance Activities Maintentance activities include sleeping, preening, and bathing—the basic physical needs of a bird in addition to eating. While we do not generally need to encourage maintenance activities, we do need to provide for them. A regular allowance for quiet, dark conditions for proper sleep is important as is provision of bathing opportunities. Although covering your bird can provide some privacy, if there is still activity and noise in the room, it is unlikely that the bird will completely rest. If possible, we recommend that you provide a small accessory cage (such as a travel cage) in a separate, darkened room, such as a bathroom or spare bedroom. The “sleeping cage” need only contain the basic essentials: a perch and water and possibly food if you may be delayed in removing the bird the next morning. As a general rule, your bird should have the opportunity for 10 to 12 hours of rest daily. If this schedule is consistent, you may be able to diminish “hormonal” or sexual behaviors since photoperiod, or day length, has some influence on the secretion of reproductive hormones. Some experts also believe that breaking up the bird’s daily environment by activity (e.g., sleeping, socializing, and feeding) could help decrease a perception of their cage as a breeding territory. Providing for your bird’s bathing needs is usually relatively simple. Some birds will prefer to bathe in a bowl while others will enjoy showering with you. Most will accept gentle misting with water. Some like to splash in the sink under a gentle stream of water. We encourage you to experiment to find your bird’s favorite method. Frequent bathing is a good thing and the only requirement is that the temperature in your house is at least 55-60°F. If they really enjoy bathing, it can be a daily activity but we recommend an opportunity at least 1 to 2 times a week. Getting Back Into Balance As mentioned earlier, an imbalanced lifestyle can lead to abnormal behaviors. For example, if a bird is picking its feathers, this could occur because of a lack of social and foraging activity. If social interaction and challenging foraging activities are introduced, there may be less time available for overpreening. Of course, there are other reasons for feather picking including health problems which should be checked out by your avian veterinarian before starting treatment yourself. Balancing daily activities should, as closely as possible, fit the natural biology and behavior of your bird’s species as well as the lifestyle constraints of your home. Maintaining a balance of healthy social interaction, foraging and nutrition, and maintenance behaviors requires conscious effort by the owner. In the wild, a multitude of external pressures and natural processes shape and mold the bird’s lifestyle. In the absence of that, you become the master of the bird’s environment. It’s a tall order to try to provide the stimulation and boundaries that nature provides, but it’s up to you to do your best. I recommend that you become as much an expert as you can on your bird’s natural lifestyle. There are some resources at the end of this packet that can help get you started. Here are some encouraging tips to help you keep it in perspective. Training & Behavior Modification Concepts Define your goalIt is essential to know what you are trying to train your bird to do, otherwise how will the bird ever learn what you want? Be sure to choose small, achievable goals at first. Use small steps or approximations to reach the goal“Rome wasn’t built in a day,” right? Nothing complicated is learned in one great chunk—not even by humans. However, breaking it down into small, short steps and practicing these steps over and over can provide the building blocks for a variety of complicated new behaviors. Use of bridges and cuesA bridge is a sound, such as a clicker, a spoken word, or a whistle, which is used in conjunction with the bird performing a desired action. The association eventually builds so that the bridge becomes a cue—a sound used to signal to the bird it is time to perform that behavior. Positive reinforcementThis is the presentation of a stimulus following a behavior that serves to maintain or increase the frequency of the behavior. Positive reinforcers are desirable items or interactions such as food rewards or moments of verbal interaction or a pet on head. The reward should be consumed or completed in within about 10 seconds so that the training can continue smoothly. Negative reinforcementThe removal of a stimulus following a behavior that serves to maintain or increase the frequency of the behavior. These tend to be unpleasant stimuli that the bird avoids. Negative reinforcement can be effective but the learner generally does not continue learning beyond the minimal amount necessary to avoid the negative stimulus. For this reason it is NOT generally recommended. Positive punishmentThe presentation of an aversive stimulus following a behavior that decreases or suppresses the frequency of the behavior is NOT RECOMMENDED as it will tend to produce counter-aggression, escape behaviors, and finally apathy. Negative punishmentThe removal of a stimulus following a behavior that serves to decrease or suppress the frequency of the behavior. This can be used carefully to replace inadvertent positive reinforcement of undesired behaviors and is particularly helpful if acceptable replacement behaviors are positively reinforced. Example: A bird is screaming in your presence and you leave the room until it stops for a couple of minutes. Then you return and offer a treat or positive interaction for being quiet. TargetsA target is something used to focus a bird’s attention and direct their next step. The bird is always rewarded when the target is touched or followed. If this rule is not violated, there is no end to the types of tasks and tricks that can be trained. A target can be as obvious as a colored stick or as basic as a raised finger. StationThis is where all the neuron-building takes place. The station can be a portable perch or anything that the bird is comfortable sitting on but which is not distracted by other birds, people, food, toys, etc. The bird will learn that this is where the best rewards are to be achieved and should look forward to the time spent at this special spot. Don’t change the rulesOnce you hold out a reward, or a hand for stepping up, or a target, and the bird follows through, you must let them have their reward. If you’ve decided it’s too easy for them, reset the scenario after the reward and make them try again with a slightly harder goal. On the flip side, if it looks like too big a step, withdraw the reward, step back for a second, then step in with a new, easier goal to achieve. PatienceAnimal training takes time and patience! This is especially true if the bird has significant social issues to overcome. Take your time and celebrate and repeat the small achievements along way.Ending on a good note: Try to end training sessions on a good note. If you see a hard-won breakthrough, give the bird a good reward and call it a day—unless it’s clear his favorite reward is continuing the training! Foundation Behaviors to Teach Your Bird Step-UpStepping up is a foundational maneuver upon which most training and behavioral guidance relies. If your bird is already fairly tame or even used to know how to step-up, then simply press your hand gently up against the front of your bird’s legs and say step-up (or use whatever bridge or cue you prefer). Once the bird places its foot onto the edge of your hand, hold still and provide a firm and solid perch with your hand. A shaking, hesitant, or unsure hand will not be a desirable perch for most birds to transfer their weight to. If your bird is not tame, you may have to start by bribing your bird to your hand by offering a small food reward. If the bird does not respond immediately then eat the reward in front of them (with obvious relish) and try again later. When they do step onto your hand to get to the bribe, avoid the temptation to lift the bird away the first few times. Repeat the exercise a few times before finally beginning to lift the bird away. If they seem uncertain, offer them a reward or set them down and start again. Remember, the priority is to build trust before building new behaviors. Step-DownStepping down is important simply to allow for you to guide your bird’s movement. To step your bird down, with your hand positioned lower than the perch you desire it to go to, gently roll your hand towards the perch, shifting the bird’s weight forward so that they step down. In most cases, the bird should be encouraged to grasp the perch with it’s beak, and then climb up to the perch from there. In this sense, the bird is actually climbing up when being stepped down most of the time. A target or food reward can be used to encourage a bird to step onto a perch for the first several times—particularly if the bird seems unsure about a new or odd-looking perch. StayStaying on a perch, where placed, is important for your bird to experience “normal” flock social interaction while outside of its cage with you. This simple behavioral requirement will allow your bird to share time with you, but not on you, and will preclude your bird from having free-roam throughout the home. The free-roaming pet parrot is at increased risk of traumatic injuries and household poisonings. Behaviorally, the free-roaming pet parrot will be at risk of developing pair-bonded interactions with one person, and may be less able to be guided into general flock interactions with others in the home. Portable tabletop perches are great for this training since they can be put anywhere and are not usually higher than people. Set your bird on the perch and occasionally offer a stroke or reward—as long as they stay put. If they climb down and walk around, put them back without any verbal cue or other reward. Come back a few minutes later and offer a reward if they stay put, or work to devise other positive reinforcement methods that will help your bird decide that staying on the training perch is a desired thing – from their point of view. Foundational Diet Recommendations An overabundance of food, foods high in fat and calories, and too many food choices can all turn on your bird’s reproductive drive. In addition, obesity and other nutritional complications may occur. For most captive parrots, the most appropriate diet is a combination of formulated pellets and vegetables. Fruit, seeds, nuts, pasta, and other people foods are not present in the regular diet. The brand or type of pellet is generally not as important as what the bird will accept. In other words, the best pellet is the one that the bird will eat! Talk to your avian veterinarian about the appropriate percentage of pellets, fresh vegetables, and other food for your particular parrot. To convert your bird to a formulated (pellet) diet: Conversion for medium to large parrotsWith the bird sharing time with you from its training perch, eat (or act like you are eating) the food in front of your bird. Make sure that you really enjoy the food item, and show your enjoyment to your bird. Offer some to your bird, but do not necessarily try to force the issue. Give a limited time to accept the offer (a few seconds). If they don’t take it, keep eating the food and make it obvious that you are enjoying it. Do this daily as it must be seen as a regular flock behavior. During the introduction period, offer pellets in a separate bowl from the old diet. Once your bird is eating the pellets during these “foraging session,” you can remove the dish used for the old diet. This will open up many opportunities for “treats” to be used as positive reinforcement and training tools in the future. Once the birds are regularly consuming a pellet diet you will notice changes in their droppings. The droppings may be larger and lighter in color than when on seed. Additionally, food colorings, if present, may be seen (orange coloration for example). Conversion of cockatiels or budgiesIt may be important to have your bird’s wings clipped unless they are very tame, in order to maintain the bird’s focus on you. Spread a variety of choices of pellets out on a table surface covered by a towel and set your bird amongst them. Use your hand to simulate a scratching and pecking flock member. Pick at the pellets, crunch them in your fingernails, and flick them about. Do this daily as it must be seen as a regular flock behavior. During the introduction period, offer pellets in a separate bowl from the old diet. Once your bird begins to eat the pellets consistently, you can replace its old diet. You may also find that using smaller pieces or varieties of pellets will be more readily accepted and you can later increase the size you feed. You may want to simulate foraging, using your fingers, in the food bowl in the cage as a final conversion training method as well. Since these species are ground-feeders, it may help to offer the pellets on the floor of the cage or in a flat dish instead of in a bowl. Even then, be sure to monitor your bird’s droppings to ensure that they are eating well. Once the birds are regularly consuming a pellet diet you will notice changes in their droppings. The droppings will generally be larger and lighter in color than when on seed. If you only see scanty, dark green feces or black feces, your bird may not be eating and will need to be offered its old diet again. Conversion of lovebirds, parrotlets, and conuresIt may be important to have your bird’s wings clipped unless they are very tame, in order to maintain the bird’s focus on you. Place a small assortment of pellets in one hand. Holding it slightly cupped, perch your bird on this same hand and use your opposite hand to simulate a scratching and pecking flock member. Pick at the pellets, crunch them in your fingernails, and flick them about. Do this daily as it must be seen as a regular flock behavior. During the introduction period, offer pellets in a separate bowl from the old diet. Once your bird begins to eat the pellets consistently, you can remove its old diet. You may also find that using smaller pieces or varieties of pellets will be more readily accepted and you can later increase the size you feed. You may want to simulate foraging, using your fingers, in the food bowl in the cage as a final conversion training method as well. Even then, be sure to monitor your bird’s droppings to ensure that they are eating well. Once the birds are regularly consuming a pellet diet you will notice changes in their droppings. The droppings will generally be larger and lighter in color than when on seed. If you only see scanty, dark green feces or black feces, your bird may not be eating and will need to be offered its old diet again. Conversion of finches and canariesFor the most part, these species will self-convert if offered a dish of very small pellets or mash. Most brands of pellets offer a finely ground mash for these birds. Offer the old diet in a separate dish until you notice a change in dropping color or you see the birds investigating the new diet. Once your bird begins to eat the pellets consistently, you can remove its old diet. Monitor your birds' droppings to ensure that they are eating well. Once the birds are regularly consuming a pellet diet you will notice changes in their droppings. The droppings will generally be larger and lighter in color than when on seed. If you only see scanty, dark green feces or black feces, your bird may not be eating and will need to be offered its old diet again. Offer vegetablesThese should be restricted to just two or three types of vegetables at a time to avoid the perception of abundance. For smaller species, I suggest trying grated or thinly sliced fresh vegetables or offering clean sprouts or broccoli. A frozen vegetable mix (e.g., corn, diced carrots, and peas or beans) can be convenient. Just thaw out a small amount each day. Restricted foodsThese include fruit, seed, nuts, pasta, rice, and other people foods. These items pack lots of calories that can stimulate reproductive behavior or cause health problems. Also, regularly offering softened or warm foods can simulate regurgitative feeding that might be offered by a mate. Nuts and seed are NOT recommended. As an alternative, edamame or other favorite beans or whole grain cereal (e.g., Cheerios) can be offered. Even then, very limited amounts of these items should be offered, preferably only as a REWARD for foraging and training. Ideally a reward item can be consumed in a few seconds so as not to interrupt the flow of training and to stretch out foraging time. Making your bird work for what they want will help balance their lifestyle, prolong your healthy interaction, and limit the amount of high-fat items that they actually eat. Inappropriate Pair Bonding Should your pet bird view you more as a mate than a member of its flock, there is a greater risk of reproductive and behavioral problems. There are four main control points that we can use to encourage or discourage our bird’s sex drive. DietIf the diet contains excess fat or simple carbohydrates or if there is a rich variety presented on a regular basis, this can support reproductive drive. See “Foundation Diet Recommendations.” Social interactionNormally, most birds do not give each other extensive physical pleasure unless they are pairing up. Long petting sessions or touching your birds in sexually-stimulating ways will reinforce the perception of you as a willing mate. Regular amounts of shoulder time may also convey a perception of sexual intimacy with you. Nesting sitesReproductive readiness starts with certain external influences but is strengthened when a bird is able to carry out nuptial actions such as nest exploration or nest building. If your bird tends to explore cabinets, closets, clothes piles, or under furniture or bed covers, this activity should be curtailed and replaced with other activities such as foraging. Photoperiod and sleep cycleVariations in day length may affect reproductive drive. I recommend maintaining a consistent day length of 10 to 12 hours. You can place your bird in a small sleep cage at night if the cage is in a room where sleep may be interrupted. A sleep cage can be a small travel cage and needs only to have a perch and some water. Going to the sleep cage should be positively reinforced, particularly during the first uses. Recheck appointments are vital for working through medical and behavioral problems. Please check with your veterinarian about when to schedule your bird’s next appointment. Suggested Resources "Captive Foraging" DVD by Dr. Scott Echols.

Category: Bathing your Bird
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bathing with water allows birds to have healthy feathers and skin. Wild birds use rainfall, a puddle, lakes, or wet vegetation. Most birds, domestic or wild, spend a lot of time taking care of their feathers. That time is not only normal, but also important. It's easier to loosen dirt on wet feathers and make feathers easier to preen. Birds preen when they arrange their feathers and in doing so spread oil from the preen gland so the feathers remain waterproof and keep them warm by trapping air. Well preened and maintained feathers are also important for aerodynamic efficiency and effective social communication. New feathers come in, generally speaking, once a year. During that year, the bird needs to keep them in good shape. Many things adversely affect their feathers, such as mites, bacteria and gradual wear so that eventually the feathers are a bit frayed.  Keeping good care of feathers likely helps birds fly better. Most indoor birds enjoy a simple bath, and once you have put everything they need into place, they do all the work while you get to watch your bird enjoy themselves. Watching them take a dip is truly entertaining, hence the popularity of bird baths in yards. Many birds like being misted with a water bottle, while some dislike it. How often a bird should be bathed comes down to the bird’s preference, not yours. It’s helpful to offer a bath once a week, but some birds will like it more often or less than that. Trial and error is the best method to find out what each particular bird prefers. Bathing in Water You can encourage your bird to bathe by offering a shallow dish inside the cage or while out socializing with you. You might also try showering with your bird, as there are commercially available perches for the shower. (Be sure to clean up any bird poop left in the tub or enclosure.) Some birds prefer to bathe under running water, such as in a sink under a faucet. Misting Watch your bird’s body language for signals that they do not like being misted. Body language will vary based on the species and individual parrot, but if you notice any attempts to escape or avoid the spray bottle, or growling/vocalizing, please do not force your bird to be misted. There are several other methods of bathing that will promote preening and you bird might enjoy. Mist your bird lightly in a manner and schedule that is accepted by your bird, and that adds to its daily life and activities. Misting is supposed to be a good thing, not a bad thing! A light misting merely implies superficial dampening of the feathers enough to guide the bird towards more normal preening activity for a short time period. If your bird is ill, fearful, or has other medical concerns, misting may not be appropriate. Misting can be combined with time that is shared with your bird out on a training perch. This combines social interaction with feather care, and the combination of these two categories can enhance the lifestyle and welfare of your parrot. The goal is enrichment, welfare and happiness. Over the Counter Products Many products are marketed to enhance the appearance of your bird’s feathers or to stop feather-damaging behaviors. Some of these products have ingredients that are far from natural, and some are realistically appropriate for mammals only. Overall, most of these products will not help, do not teach or enrich alternative activities and behaviors, and some can actually cause harm. In general, we recommend water as your misting agent, and the money that you save by not purchasing some of these commercially offered sprays can be better applied toward toys or other environmental enriching products. Outdoor Bird Baths If you keep a bird bath for wildlife, it needs to provide clean water. That means you will need to clean it. Algae is the most common problem. If you see algae, empty the bath. Mix three parts water to one part vinegar and spray it on the algae. This mixture will not harm nearby plants. OR:  one part distilled white vinegar to nine parts water. If necessary, use a wire brush to scrub debris. If bleach is needed, it should be diluted at about one cup per gallon and used for scrubbing and cleaning. Afterwards, the surfaces should be rinsed well, and allowed to fully air dry before being used.

Category: DNA Vaccine Approved for Chickens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Some new exciting technology has gained USDA conditional approval for the poultry industry. It is a DNA vaccine for avian influenza.  Agrilabs indicates the vaccine is created by splicing a gene for a specific antigen related to an avian influenza virus into a bacterial plasmid, and then the plasmid is administered along with an adjuvant that improves vaccine delivery into target cells.  Once the antigen is in the target cells, an immune response is triggered to hopefully allow the animal’s immune system to fight off the disease.  The conditional license allows Agrilabs to stock pile large amounts of the vaccine if the vaccine is needed for a future avian flu outbreak.  The company indicates this is a major milestone in realizing the promise of DNA vaccines in animal health.  Past DNA vaccines have failed to be effective and were too costly and inconvenient, but the company’s newly developed adjuvant has helped to increase effectiveness. An adjuvant is a chemical added to a vaccine to make it more effective. DNA vaccines do not expose animals to the actual disease so there is no risk of the animal developing the disease as could happen with a modified live viral vaccine.  And if vaccinated animals do become infected, it can be determined if the infection is due to the virus or the vaccine.  The company indicates that the adjuvant is a really important part of this vaccine as it allows a lower dose of vaccine to be used, which lowers the cost.  The company is also using the same technology to develop vaccines for swine influenza and cattle.  Avian influenza is highly contagious and deadly, and because many chickens are housed together, avian influenza can wipe out an entire flock in a short period of time.

Category: Signs of Illness in Pet Birds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English How to Pick up on Potential Illness Sooner Some people have the impression that pet birds can go from fine and healthy one day to looking seriously ill the next. While there are situations that cause a bird to get really sick really fast, oftentimes this is not the case. By the time a bird is showing more obvious signs of sickness, they have likely not been feeling well for a while. This isn’t accidental; your pet bird doesn’t want you to know they are sick. Most birds are prey species and have adapted to hide signs of sickness as looking or acting visibly sick often meant looking tasty to potential predators. What this means is that as a bird owner you have to pay closer attention to your pet in order to pick up on more subtle signs of sickness. Observe your bird, and pay attention to: You want to get to know your bird really well and establish a baseline of what normal means for that individual bird.Part of doing so means keeping track of their weight as this is a very important measure of their health. Birds have very high metabolisms and their weight can rapidly decrease with only a day or two of not eating. This rapid weight loss results in a catabolic state that can quickly be life threatening. To avoid this situation, some people weigh their birds daily with a scale, which is a more accurate way to track weight loss or gain than simply looking at them and guessing. If you do invest in a scale, make sure to weigh your bird at the same time each day as their weight may vary quite a bit throughout the day. The goal here is to establish what is normal for your bird. This is important because oftentimes when a bird starts feeling sick there will be changes away from normal but these can be easy to miss if you aren’t paying close attention. What Healthy Looks Like Ideally, you should consult with your veterinarian before getting a pet bird and have done some research on what is normal and healthy for the species you plan to own. This is incredibly important to do before getting your pet bird as it will prepare you to be a better owner and can solidify whether the species you want is actually a good choice for you. Companion birds require a good amount of work and each have their own unique needs. Seriously consider whether you will consistently meet all of your bird’s needs. It’s also a good idea to know whether you believe the type of bird you want will be a good fit for you and your family before you purchase one. As a general guideline your bird should be alert and curious about their surroundings; their feathers should be sleek, well-groomed and clean; and they should have a good appetite. A healthy bird should be symmetrical (its wings are at the same level); bear weight evenly so it is not leaning or favoring one side; perch with no problem; breathe easily with a closed mouth; and poop effortlessly. Your bird’s face, eyes, ears and nostrils should be free of any debris. Let’s talk about your bird’s droppings. Again, normal varies by species, diet, age, and many other factors but here’s a quick description of what normal pet bird droppings should look like. There are three parts to bird droppings: feces, urates and liquid urine. Urates are semisolid material consisting of concentrated urine. Unless dealing with poultry, waterfowl or carnivorous birds, normal fresh feces should be slightly loose to firm in consistency and basically odorless. It will vary between different shades of brown when a bird is fed a pelleted diet and will be more on the greenish side if given a seed diet. The color of feces can change if a bird is fed certain foods like blackberries and sweet potatoes so it’s important to keep that in mind. Normal urates should be white and normal urine should be clear. Earlier Signs of Sickness (Often Subtle) One of the first signs of sickness tends to be a decrease in talking or other sounds. Other changes in behavior or personality can include increased aggression, screaming, intolerance of strangers, biting their enclosure or toys, and feather picking. Appearance-wise, untidy or dirty feathers may indicate a problem with the feathers or could be because the bird isn’t grooming itself; something else is going on that is making your bird not want to groom. Other early signs of disease can include flakiness on skin or beak, sores on bottoms of feet, and lameness or shifting of body weight. Remember changes in any of the factors in the observe your bird list could indicate a problem as well. For example, if your bird’s urine isn’t clear or it isn’t eating as much as normal, these could be signs that something isn’t quite right. Looking for trends or big changes is a good idea. For example, if your bird’s weight goes down a little one day and returns to normal the next, then you probably don’t have to worry as much depending on what happens in the next few days. Before worrying, you want to see either a trend of something that isn’t good (so continual small drops in weight) or a big change. For instance, if your bird loses 10% of its bodyweight over any period of time, you need to have your bird examined by a veterinarian. In addition, there are some changes that may seem small but are not. General and More Serious Signs of Sickness The classic “sick bird look” is fluffed feathers, closed eyes and a more depressed, lethargic attitude. A bird only looks this way once it isn’t able to hide its sickness any longer, meaning the bird hasn’t been feeling well for a while. These birds may fluff their feathers to conserve body heat as they have lower body temperatures than normal. Alternatively, they may hold both wings away from their body and pant which indicates that they are usually heat stressed or very oxygen deprived. Behavioral signs that should not be ignored include: Physical signs of sickness: If you notice any of these in your pet bird you should consider seeking out veterinary assistance promptly. Remember these general signs tend to happen once earlier signs of illness may have already been missed and can indicate a more serious problem. Many of these signs are general and can be caused by a number of different diseases but they all indicate that there’s a problem. The sooner you notice changes in your bird and recognize signs of early illness, the more likely you and your veterinarian will able to stop or prevent serious illness.

Category: Lead Contamination in Backyard Chickens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many folks are raising backyard chickens for meat and eggs as they are trying to get a safer alternative to commercially produced eggs.  However, Dr. Radford Davis at Iowa State indicates that there are some concerns that the birds can be exposed to heavy metals such as lead, and they could pass toxic lead on to people in the eggs or meat. The chickens may pick up lead from sources like contaminated water or food, but the most likely source of lead is contaminated soil.  Soil can be contaminated by flakes of lead-based paint that may have come off older buildings or even be contaminated if guns were shot nearby in the past.  A study out of California recently looked at lead exposure in backyard chickens and lead contamination of eggs, which can affect human health.  Livers from about 1500 backyard chickens were tested for a 1-year period and over 3% were positive for lead. Most lead-positive chickens were from urban areas, not rural ones. The chickens with the highest lead concentration would lay eggs that would double the recommended amount of lead for a child under 6 years old, and liver exposure in children can lead to behavior disorders, attention deficit disorders, decreased brain volume and decreased IQ.  Even at lower levels, repeated consumption of lead can cause a problem as lead was found in chicken feed, paint chips and blood from other chickens in the flock.  Most chickens did not have clinical signs although still had enough lead in their bodies to contaminate meat and eggs and potentially cause illness in humans. To prevent this, check your soil for lead (ask your veterinarian how to do that in your area) and also check lead levels in eggs before feeding them to your family.

Category: Feather Destructive Behavior in Birds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Feather destructive behavior (also called feather picking) happens when birds damage their feathers with their beak. This is not a disease by itself, but a symptom of an underlying problem. Feather picking can cause baldness, and in severe cases it can damage underlying tissues. It is widespread among captive parrots, especially grey parrots and cockatoos, but any pet bird can be affected. Left unchecked, feather picking has serious consequences. Besides causing baldness or a lack of nice feathers, feather picking affects a bird’s ability to keep itself warm, can cause bleeding, infections, and permanent damage to the feather follicle, thus preventing normal regrowth. This can progress to an obsessive-compulsive disorder, making treatment much more difficult. Causes Feather picking is a consequence of captivity. This behavior is much less common in wild birds. The conditions of captivity provide less stimulation than a bird has in the wild,where they spend their time avoiding predators, exploring their environment, socializing, etc. A bird may feather pick in response to decreased levels of mental and social stimulation. Causes are divided into medical and non-medical. Several can contribute to feather picking at the same time. While not listed below, any disease that causes pain, discomfort, irritation or itch can be a medical cause. Non-medical causes Medical Causes Recognizing Feather Picking in your Bird Any feather your bird can reach is fair game, although the chest, undersurface of the wing and inner thigh are most commonly affected. Feathers on the head and neck are unaffected because their beak cannot reach these areas. To spot changes as soon as possible, be familiar with what your bird’s feathers and general appearance normally look like as well as what they should look like. Your bird’s feathers should be tidy and sleek. If you notice any broken feathers or bald spots, consult your veterinarian. Diagnosis Diagnosing the underlying cause(s) of feather picking can be a long process and requires excellent cooperation between you and your veterinarian. With non-medical causes so common, it is important to provide your veterinarian with a thorough history of your bird’s behavior and environment. This helps your veterinarian rule in or out possible causes. In addition, your veterinarian will perform a physical examination and an assessment of your bird. Once your veterinarian has a good list of possible causes, they may decide further specific tests are needed. These can include bloodwork, x-rays, skin biopsies, and more. These tests are tailored to your individual bird. Treatment Realistically, eliminating feather picking in each bird is not possible. Feather picking is a complex problem with different contributing factors. A reduction in the amount of feather picking can be considered a success. The basis for several treatment strategies is to provide your bird with healthy, more desirable alternatives to feather picking. Feather picking serves a purpose to your bird. It can help birds cope with boredom, stress, anxiety and other unpleasant feelings. Treatment plans are designed to address the underlying reason of why your bird is picking. How they do so should be tailored to your bird and your lifestyle. The most impressive treatment plans will fail if they cannot be carried out. Different Therapeutic Strategies A lot of work and time go into creating a treatment plan and carrying it out. It is important to work closely with your veterinarian. Some strategies are slowly introduced to prevent over-stimulation, stress, and other risks. Depending on your bird’s response and what works best, your treatment plan will change as time goes on. Temporary Fixes Temporary measures that reduce feather picking include Elizabethan collars, neck braces, fabric jackets or vests, and applying foul-tasting substances to the areas being picked. These tactics are not solutions. Your bird is still upset, agitated, or sick and will feather pick if given the chance. Prognosis Feather picking requires a fair amount of persistence and patience from both the owner and veterinarian. Despite an excellent treatment plan and teamwork, success may mean only a reduction of feather picking rather than eliminating it entirely. Catching it early improves the chance of success.

Category: Feather Picking (Feather Destructive Behavior)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Feather picking is an all too common condition in pet bird population. Also known as feather destructive behavior or feather damaging behavior (FDB), it seems to be most common in African gray parrots, Quakers and various cockatoo species. Additionally, it is not uncommon among cockatiels, lovebirds and parrotlets. That being said, feather destructive behavior can occur in any bird species. This condition can often be frustrating to owners, and achieving a correct diagnosis and cure of the underlying condition can prove challenging for even the most experienced avian veterinarian. Many people think of FDB as strictly a cosmetic issue; this is often not entirely true and FDB may have a serious underlying medical cause. Feather picking is more accurately defined as a symptom rather than a specific disease. There are many different possible causes. Broadly, these causes are categorized into two groups: medical and behavioral. Medical Causes Medical picking usually occurs because of an underlying disease that causes pain, irritation and or direct feather damage. Several examples of medically-induced FDB include: kidney and/or liver damage or failure; testicular or ovarian disease; musculoskeletal damage; gastrointestinal diseases or dysfunction; certain viral conditions; primary bacterial or fungal dermatitis; allergic skin disease; internal or external parasites; nutritional deficiencies. In order to diagnose these medical causes, a variety of diagnostic tests may be required in addition to a thorough history and physical examination. Behavioral Causes In simple terms, behavioral feather picking is often associated with boredom. In the wild, a bird's day is filled with activity; they spend the majority of their day foraging for fresh food and water and finding secure nesting or roosting sites. They also tend to spend a great deal of time socializing with other birds and preening themselves as well as other flock members. In the comforts of our homes and apartments, birds often need only walk a few inches along a perch to find large dishes full of plentiful food and water. They are often alone for many waking hours as the other members of their flock (humans in this case) leave the roost and go to work or school for the day. Typically most pet birds lack a companion for company and mutual preening, and this may predispose them to over grooming, which is often the first step on the road to feather-damaging behavior. Unfortunately, buying a companion bird may not cure a bird that is already picking, and in some cases may even worsen the situation due to incompatibility. In addition to boredom, other causes of feather picking include lack of exercise, inappropriate sleep patterns, and poorly directed reproductive behaviors. Diagnostic Approach It has always been my approach to first attempt to exclude medical causes of picking while always keeping in mind the behavioral components of the disease. This way, serious and potentially life-threatening diseases are not overlooked. Additionally, this approach may allow us to diagnose more minor conditions that, while not life threatening, can cause serious feather destructive behavior. Unfortunately, if left untreated for long periods of time, feather picking can become a habit. This may mean that when the instigating cause is discovered and cured, the feather damaging behavior may continue. In these instances a combined medical/behavioral approach is critical. The assumption that all feather damaging is behavioral in origin is simplistic, incorrect and may have potentially serious ramifications for the patient. Only when we are confident that all underlying medical causes have been ruled out will we consider the condition to be primarily behavioral in nature.
