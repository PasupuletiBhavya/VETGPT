Category: Adverse Reactions to Spot-on Flea and Tick Products
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Spot-on flea and tick products for dogs and cats have greatly improved the safety and convenience of controlling external parasites on our pets. Using pesticides that are many degrees less toxic and frequently more effective than the organophosphate or carbamate dips and sprays of the past, these spot-on products help keep our pets (and our homes) free of annoying pests that can also carry serious diseases. When used according to the label directions, spot-on products are well tolerated by most pets. However, as with any product that is applied directly on the skin, there is the possibility that certain individuals will have adverse local reactions to one or more ingredients in the product. Some individuals will have similar reactions to many different spot-on products with different active ingredients, suggesting that their sensitivities may be to some of the inactive ingredients. These reactions are restricted to the area of skin that comes in direct contact with the product, so they do not reflect a systemic toxicosis but rather a local hypersensitivity. Skin reactions to spot-on products can vary from mild tingling sensations to actual chemical burns of the skin in especially sensitive individuals. The mildest form of skin reaction to spot-on products is epidermal paresthesia, which is defined as an abnormal sensation such as an itch or prickling of the skin. Paresthesia occurs when the applied product "tickles" the nerve endings in the skin, causing the characteristic sensation. Although paresthesia may occur with any spot-on product, it is most commonly associated with products containing concentrated pyrethroids such as permethrin, cyphenothrin, and etofenprox. Pyrethroid paresthesia is a syndrome that has been well documented in both humans and animals. Human descriptions of pyrethroid paresthesia vary from "tingling" to "pins and needles" to "burning" sensations in the skin at the site of pyrethroid contact. These sensations begin within 30 minutes of application and may last 8 to 24 hours if untreated. Some pets appear to experience similar discomfort following application of spot-on products; the fact that the products are generally applied between the shoulder blades can make the sensation particularly annoying to the pets. Affected pets, cats in particular, may become hyperactive and agitated as they try to walk away from the sensation; others may become quiet, subdued and reluctant to move. Skin at the product application site will appear normal (if redness is noted, you're dealing with contact dermatitis, see below). Fortunately, treating epidermal paresthesia is fairly simple and entails bathing off the product with a mild dish soap (pet shampoos are too mild to remove all of the product). For pyrethroid paresthesia, applying vitamin E to the affected skin can provide quick relief— just use scissors to snip open a vitamin E capsule (the kind used as a vitamin supplement) and squeeze the oily contents onto the pet's skin and rub it in. A rare but more significant skin reaction (in terms of sensitivity) to spot-on products is contact dermatitis, in which an inflammatory reaction develops in response to the topically applied product. These responses - sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity reactions - can occur upon the first use of a product, but more commonly occur after several uneventful exposures to the product. The body sets up an inflammatory response to the site of application, and the skin will appear red and irritated. In more severe cases, wheals or blisters may develop and the skin may actually ulcerate. Unlike paresthesia, which tends to occur within 30 minutes of application, oftentimes the onset of contact dermatitis is delayed for several hours, with the full extent of the injury taking 12 to 24 hours to develop. Depending on the degree of the inflammatory reaction, the level of discomfort can range from mild to quite severe. After bathing off the spot-on product, pets who develop more than mild redness at the application site should be seen by their veterinarians for further treatment to reduce the inflammation and discomfort. The good news is that skin reactions to spot-on flea/tick control products are quite uncommon, and most pets will have no problems when these products are used. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict which individual will react to a given product until the reaction has occurred. For this reason, it is a good idea to observe your pet closely for at least an hour following the application of any spot-on product for any signs of discomfort. Although not life-threatening, skin reactions can range from mildly annoying to very painful; for this reason, a pet that has had a reaction to a spot-on product should never have the same product applied in the future. If a spot-on product is still desired for flea and/or tick control, try a product with different active ingredients than the one that caused the reaction. Following application, watch the pet carefully and be ready to bathe at the first sign of problems. Unfortunately, there are rare individuals that cannot tolerate any of the topical spot-on products, and other flea control options such as sprays or dips may be needed. More serious problems can result when spot-on flea/tick products designed for dogs are inappropriately applied to cats. Certain concentrated pyrethroids (e.g. permethrin) that are not harmful to dogs can cause life-threatening tremors and/or seizures if applied to cats—these are not really adverse events but are instead true poisonings since the product was misused.  Always read the label before using any topical flea/tick product on cats, andneverapply products intended for dogs onto cats. Frontline (fipronil) istoxic to rabbits. If your pet has a reaction to a flea or tick control product of any kind, you should report the reaction. All spot-on product labels will have a phone number that you can use to report the reaction to the manufacturer. By law, the manufacturer is required to send monthly reports of adverse reactions to the appropriate federal regulating authority. Alternatively, you can go to the agencies' websites to find out how to report reactions directly to them. Report reactions to flea/tick products containing heartworm preventatives, such as Revolution and Advantage Multi, to the Food and Drug Administration; report flea/tick products that do not contain heartworm preventatives to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Category: Asthma in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Asthma? Asthma is a recurring respiratory compromise featuring the constriction (narrowing) of the lung’s airways. There are three features that define asthma: • Airway inflammation• Airway hyper-responsiveness• Reduced airflow (which is at least partly reversible) More simply, this means the airways of the lungs are inflamed, plus they are extra reactive to mental stress or respiratory irritants, and the flow of air through the lungs is reduced (either sometimes or all the time). When all three features are present, we can be comfortable diagnosing asthma. What Exactly is Happening in the Lungs with Asthma? First, excess mucus forms in the airways. After that, the airway walls swell with inflammation and can actually ulcerate. Finally, the airway muscles go into spasms leading to constriction. Airway constriction leads to an inability to draw a deep breath, intolerance to exercise, coughing, and musical sighing sounds called “wheezes,” though not all these symptoms may be apparent at the same time. Sometimes a low-grade chronic cough is the only evident sign, but it should be remembered that a sudden asthmatic crisis can arise at any time and can represent a life-threatening event. Asthmatic airway constriction can happen spontaneously, in reaction to stress or anxiety, or as a type of allergic reaction. Relieving and preventing airway constriction is the main focus of treatment. Is Feline Asthma the Same as Human Asthma? The feline condition was named asthma because of the clinical features shared with the human disease. As of this time, it appears that all the diagnostic criteria needed to diagnose asthma in people are shared by cats, yet we are still working out the mechanics of this syndrome in cats and have a great deal to learn. For example, in humans, we know that while actual symptoms of asthma occur in episodes, the airways of the lung are diseased all the time. We do not know yet if feline airways are also diseased all the time or if the actual airway structural changes occur only when there are clinical signs of distress. How is the Diagnosis Made? Because of the constricted airways, the actual volume of air this patient can move in and out of the lungs with each breath is reduced. There is often a great deal of effort seen in the cat’s breathing. The abdomen appears to be working to push air out and the breaths are shallow and rapid. The cat may even be breathing with its mouth open in an effort to move the largest possible amount of air. The next step toward making a diagnosis of feline asthma is the chest radiograph, assuming the cat is not in too much distress to hold still for this procedure. Classically, this radiograph will show what is called air-trapping, meaning that the small airways have constricted so that inhaled air cannot be exhaled. The lungs are larger in appearance than normal as they are over-inflated. The diaphragm may seem flattened due to this over-inflation. It is possible to view the tiny airways in much higher detail on radiographs. This is partly because they are made more prominent because of the mucus and inflammatory fluid inside them (the doughnuts and tramlines, as mentioned below) and partly because they are surrounded by more air than usual (air-trapping). Inflammation and mucus build up within the airways, causing their walls to appear thickened in the radiograph. The terms used for such airway appearance are doughnuts (when viewing the airway end-on) or tramlines (when viewing the airway from the side). You may hear your veterinarian use these terms, and they are classical findings in airway disease. Some Asthmatic Cats Have Normal Radiographs Since visible changes are not always evident on radiographs, which can lead to diagnosing asthma when it is not there. Indeed, diagnosing asthma can be complicated, and it is famously underdiagnosed because up to 23% of asthmatic cats can have completely normal radiographs. The coughing cat with normal chest radiographs poses a diagnostic dilemma. It is hard enough to sort out potential issues when there actually are radiographic changes, as many conditions can mimic others. Because of the nature of feline heart disease, where the heart muscle can thicken without the overall external shape of the heart changing, heart disease should be considered. In heartworm-endemic areas,feline heartworm diseaseshould be considered. If the patient is thought not to have too high of an anesthetic risk, a tracheal wash and/or bronchoscopy can be considered but often have indefinite results. CT (cat scan) imaging is emerging as a helpful diagnostic tool, but it is not yet available in many areas. Response to Therapy as a Diagnostic Test One important asthma feature is that the airway constriction it engenders is reversible. In an emergency situation, a small dose of epinephrine (adrenalin) orterbutaline(which expands airways) can reverse an asthmatic crisis in as little as 15 minutes. Response to an injectable corticosteroid (such asdexamethasone) generally yields a positive response within 30 minutes. Sometimes, diagnostic tests still leave room for questions, and you have to simply go with medical treatment for asthma and regard response to therapy as evidence that the diagnosis is correct. See below for a list of medications commonly used in the long-term management of this problem. Treatment Options Oral and Injectable Steroids It is crucial to realize that the underlying problem in the airway is inflammation. Inflammation is what is responsible for constriction. To resolve inflammation, corticosteroid medications have been the cornerstone of therapy. These can be given in pills, by injection, or, more recently, through a metered dose inhaler. Usually, treatment is started with either an oral corticosteroid such asprednisoloneor a long-acting injection such as Depo-Medrol. These medications are relatively inexpensive, and a good response to them helps confirm the diagnosis, as mentioned. A better strategy might be to use oral or injectable steroids to ensure that they work and if they do, change to a metered dose inhaler (see below), as there is much less potential for corticosteroid side effects with an inhaler. If the response to oral corticosteroids is good, they may be continued long-term, supplemented with some of the other medications mentioned below, or used only during flare-ups. Long-term corticosteroid use has some potential for side effects, though feline patients tend to be resistant to these problems. If giving pills is too difficult, especially in a cat that is stressed and having some trouble breathing, a long-acting corticosteroid injection can be used periodically to control asthma symptoms. Cats are more sensitive to potential side effects from these injections as they are much stronger than oral corticosteroids. This sensitivity means that injections can only be given periodically without the risk of developingdiabetes mellitus. If the cat seems to require an injection more frequently than every other month, a metered dose inhaler should be considered (see below for details). When using oral corticosteroids, it is important to taper the dose over time so as to find the minimum dose needed to control symptoms. If higher doses are used indefinitely, asthma symptoms may become resistant to steroids. This resistance is more of a problem with injectable steroids and manifests as a shorter and shorter interval between the need for the injection. Again, if this is seen, consider changing to an inhaled form of medication. Metered Dose Inhalers Human asthmatics have enjoyed the benefits of portable inhalers for years. These handy devices deliver medication locally to the airways, thus minimizing drug side effects to the rest of the body while maximizing desired response. There were two problems with using these devices in cats: Interestingly these same problems apply to human infants with asthma and a device called a pediatric spacer was invented for them. This tubular chamber is attached to the inhaler on one end and a face mask on the other. The inhaler is actuated into the spacer and the infant simply breathes in the spacer’s contents. The discovery that the pediatric spacer could also be used for cats has solved the feline inhaler problem as well. The setup is the same as described above for young children and the cat takes 7 to 10 breaths from the face mask to be properly dosed. Corticosteroid inhalers, Flovent® being the most popular, are typically used twice daily long term while airway dilator inhalers such as albuterol-containing Proventil® or Ventolin® are used for flare-ups. Cats are generally started on a combination of oral prednisone and the metered dose inhaler and gradually maintained on only the metered dose inhaler. Pediatric equipment is generally available from most human pharmacies, however, a device created specifically for feline use can be ordered. It comes with a spacer and an appropriately sized face mask. Your veterinarian will need to prescribe the metered dose inhaler usually from a regular human pharmacy. See theAerokatdevice. Are there other Treatment Options? Other medications that might be helpful include: Allergen-Specific ImmunotherapySince allergy is generally a part of the asthma picture, it makes sense that "allergy shots" might be helpful. In fact, they are helpful to many cats. It is important to realize that this form of therapy takes months before benefits are obvious so it is not a method for fast relief but more for the "bigger picture." The owner must be able to give injections to the patient at home regularly. A veterinary dermatologist is generally needed to oversee this type of therapy. Airway DilatorsTerbutaline(Brethine®) andtheophyllineare airway dilators commonly used in the management of asthma. It makes sense that if constriction is an important feature of this disease that eliminating constriction would be therapeutically helpful. Terbutaline is available orally or as an injectable. Some veterinarians encourage owners to keep a bottle of injectable terbutaline at home in case of a crisis and show them how to give it. If you are interested in this, let your veterinarian know. Theophylline is an oral medication usually given once a day at bedtime.  CyclosporineThe use of cyclosporine in asthma is relatively new. Cyclosporine is an immunomodulator often used in organ transplant patients. It has been used occasionally in cats where adequate suppression of inflammation has not been possible with combinations of the other medications listed or when the cat is unable to take corticosteroids for other reasons (concurrent diabetes mellitus, infection, history ofcalcium oxalate bladder stones,etc.). Cyclosporine should not be prohibitively expensive since cats, being small, require relatively small doses but blood levels of cyclosporine may be periodically recommended which increases the expense of this treatment significantly. Don’t Forget... Minimizing irritants in the air is always helpful to an asthmatic cat. It is important to realize that asthma can culminate in a respiratory crisis that can become life-threatening if ignored. If your cat begins to breathe with an open mouth or if you see excessive abdominal movement during breathing and the cat is not purring, you may have an emergency situation. Contact your veterinarian immediately.

Category: Atopic Dermatitis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English You or someone you know may have allergies, but did you know your cat can too? Atopic dermatitis (atopy, allergic dermatitis, feline atopic skin syndrome, non-flea, and non-food hypersensitivity dermatitis) is a hypersensitivity, or over-reaction, to a variety of common and otherwise harmless substances in the environment. Cats with atopic dermatitiscan be allergic to plant pollens,house dust,mites,and mold spores. Signs Atopic cats may lick, chew, rub, or scratch parts of the body, such as the back, sides, face, and ears. This itchiness (pruritus) and scratching can cause thickened, reddened skin with excoriations (scratch marks) and crusts (scabs). However, atopic cats may also hide scratching behaviors. It’s very common for pet owners never to see their atopic cats scratch and instead only see alopecia (hair loss). Diagnosis Many conditions besides allergiescan cause your cat to beitchy.To diagnose your cat, your veterinarian may take skin and hair samples to determine if askin infectionor parasite is causing your cat’s itching. Once your cat’s veterinarian has ruled out other causes of itching and diagnosed atopic dermatitis, allergy tests can be used to identify what your cat is allergic to in the environment. Cats can be allergy tested through an intradermal allergy test or blood allergy test. In an intradermal allergy test, small amounts of common allergens are injected into the skin, and then the veterinarian watches for a skin reaction. In a blood allergy test, antibodies (protein levels) against various allergens are measured. Neither of these tests can diagnose atopic dermatitis. Instead, these allergy tests are used to identify what a cat is allergic to so that a cat can be started on allergen-specific immunotherapy (hyposensitization or allergy injections). Each allergy test has its advantages and disadvantages. Intradermal allergy testing is a specialized test performed by aboard-certified veterinary dermatologist. A mild sedative is given to relax your cat during the test, and hair is clipped on one side of the chest. While a blood allergy test only needs a blood sample from your cat, some atopic dermatitis cats don’t have antibodies that the blood test can measure. Unlike humans, allergy tests cannot be used to diagnose food allergies in cats. Management Cats with atopic dermatitis can’t avoid everything they’re allergic to. When cats groom themselves, they lick off and swallow allergens that have settled on their hair coat. For allergic cats, even a small amount of allergen can trigger a feeling of itch. If your cat is diagnosed with atopic dermatitis, a variety of anti-allergy medications are available. These medicationsinclude antihistamines,steroids(cortisone), andcyclosporine. Not every medication works for all cats. Itcan also be a struggle to give oral medications to some cats. Although steroid injections can be administered to cats, these injectable steroids may have more side effects than oral steroids. Not every medication works for all cats. With anti-allergy medications such as steroids, some cats may develop serious side effects. Another option to prevent flare-ups of atopic dermatitis in cats is allergen-specific immunotherapy, which involves hyposensitization and allergy injections. Immunotherapy involves giving your cat a series of diluted allergens based on what they are allergic to. Over time, immunotherapy makes cats less sensitive to their allergens. However, it takes time to have its full effect. Do not discontinue immunotherapy on your own without consulting your veterinarian. When helpful, immunotherapy is usually continued lifelong but may be given less frequently over time.

Category: Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia (IMT)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Immune Destruction of Blood Platelets, also called ITP or IMT ) What is a Platelet? A platelet is a cloud-shaped blood cell, neither related to the red blood cell line nor the white blood cell line. Platelets assist in the clotting of blood in that they home in on damaged areas of blood vessels and aggregate there, meaning that they pile onto each other and bind, forming a small plug to seal the hole in the leaking blood vessel. While piled on each other, they release assorted biochemicals that initiate a more permanent fibrous seal of the tear. Of course, large tears are too big for platelets to seal but when it comes to small bleeds and normal blood vessel wear and tear, platelets are the star of the show. There is a saying that “platelets are vascular integrity and vascular integrity is platelets.” A small bleed unstaunched by a platelet aggregation quickly becomes a large bruise. Spontaneous bruising (in other words, visible bruising from the normal wear and tear of one's body) is a sign of reduced platelet numbers or poor platelet function. Small abnormal bruises are called petechiae or petechial hemorrhages.  Large abnormal bruises are called ecchymoses or ecchymotic hemorrhages. Platelets in Times of Health Platelets come from the bone marrow where a large (actually gigantic relative to the red and white blood cell precursors) cell called a megakaryocyte spits off little active pieces of itself. These pieces are platelets, ready to enter circulation where they will live for an average of 8 to 12 days in a dog or 6 to 8 days in a human before a bleeding capillary calls them to their destiny. At any given time some 200,000 to 500,000 platelets are on patrol in the circulatory system, though only about 20,000 to 50,000 are considered the bare minimum to prevent spontaneous bruising and bleeding. About one-third of the circulating platelets are stored in the spleen, like boats in a harbor, ready to mobilize if necessary. When platelets become too old to be useful, the spleen has cells called phagocytes that essentially eat old cells and recycle their inner materials. Immune-Mediated Platelet Destruction For reasons unknown, platelets can be mistaken by the immune system for invaders. When this happens, antibodies coat the platelets and the spleen’s phagocytes (a type of cell that absorbs other cells) remove them in numbers up to 10 times greater than the normal platelet removal rate. In a normal situation, old platelets are removed in the liver, an interaction that generates a message to the bone marrow megakaryocytic (bone marrow cells that produce platelets) to make more platelets. In immune-mediated disease, the platelet removal venue switches to the spleen, and the interaction is different; the megakaryocytic in the marrow may or may not be stimulated properly. If the marrow successfully receives the message to make more platelets, the megakaryocytes respond by getting larger and growing in numbers so that they may increase their platelet production. The platelets produced under these circumstances tend to be larger and more effective than normal platelets and are called stress platelets. The bone marrow attempts to overcome the accelerated platelet destruction rate by stepping up production; unfortunately, with immune-mediated destruction occurring, a platelet can expect to survive only one day or less in circulation instead of its normal 8 to 12 days. If antibody levels are high, a platelet may survive only minutes or hours after its release from the bone marrow, and making matters worse, the antibody-coated platelets still circulating do not function normally. This is balanced by the especially effective stress platelets entering the scene so that overall it is hard to predict how the balance will work out in a given patient. Making matters worse, sometimes the bone marrow simply does not receive the message to make more platelets. What Would Cause the Immune System to get so Confused? Keep in mind that the immune system responds to the shapes of proteins present on a cell’s surface. These shapes are similar to ID cards. The immune system recognizes shapes defined as “self” and does not attack but when it sees a cell expressing protein shapes that are “non-self,” it will respond. If the immune system is responding to a blood parasite, tumor, drug, or other cell type (as in lupus orimmune-mediated hemolytic anemia), it will be producing antibodies against enemy shapes. Some of these shapes may, unfortunately, resemble some “self” shapes such as some of the shapes on the surface of the platelets. The platelets are then misidentified as the enemy and are attacked. What Happens to the Patient? The usual patient is a middle-aged dog. Poodles appear to be predisposed although Cocker Spaniels and Old English Sheepdogs also seem to have a higher than average incidence of this condition. Spontaneous bruising is the major clinical sign. The gums and oral surfaces as well as the whites of the eyes are obvious areas to check as is the hairless area of the belly. Small spots of bruising in large conglomerations called petechiae (pet-TEEK-ee-a) are the hallmark sign. A large, purple expansive bruise might also be seen, which is called ecchymosis. Large internal bleeds are not typical of platelet dysfunction, though bleeding small amounts in urine, from the nose, or rectally may also indicate a platelet problem. When these sorts of signs are seen, a platelet count is drawn, along with usually an array of clotting parameters, red blood cell counts to assess blood loss, and other general metabolic blood tests. Since reliable testing to detect anti-platelet antibodies is not available, the veterinarian must determine if any other possible causes of low platelet count make sense. Causes of Platelet Reduction Dramatic reduction in platelet numbers is almost always caused by primary immune-mediated destruction, which means there is no apparent cause; the immune system just went haywire. That said, it may be worth making an effort to identify a blood parasite or other cause of the platelet drop. If an infectious agent such as one of these is responsible for the immune-mediated platelet destruction, obviously specific therapy against the infection is warranted in addition to therapy for the platelet destruction. Very low platelet counts can also occur in response to the suppression of megakaryocytes within the bone marrow. This might be caused by: Disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC) is a life-threatening, disastrous failure of normal blood clotting and clot-dissolving functions in the body. One of its hallmark signs is a drop in platelet count, along with a constellation of other signs. If platelet numbers are normal but it is obvious that platelet function is not, some other causes to look into might include: Therapy for Immune-Mediated Platelet Destruction Once a tentative diagnosis of immune-mediated platelet destruction has been made, the goal of therapy is to stop the phagocytes of the spleen from removing the antibody-coated platelets by cutting off antibody production. This, of course, means suppression of the immune system using whatever combination of medications seems to work best for the individual patient. Prednisolone, Prednisone,orDexamethasoneThese steroid hormones are the first line of defense and, often all that is necessary to bring platelet counts back up. Unfortunately, long-term use should be expected and this means steroid side effects are eventually inevitable: excessive thirst, possible urinary tract infection, panting, poor hair coat, etc. The good news is that these effects should resolve once the medication is discontinued; further, if side effects are especially problematic, other medications can be brought in to reduce the dose of steroid needed. Prednisolone is the pre-activated form of prednisone. VincristineThis injectable medication is mildly immune suppressive but also seems to stimulate a sudden burst of platelet release from the marrow megakaryocytes. The platelets released in response to vincristine contain a phagocyte toxin so that when they are ultimately eaten by spleen phagocytes, the phagocytes will die. While repeated injections of vincristine, ine ultimately do not yield the same effect, at least a one-time dose may be extremely helpful.Vincristineis extremely irritating if delivered outside of the vein. It must be given by IV cleanly or the overlying tissue will slough. Vincristine is generally used for unstable or more severely affected patients. Azathioprine,Cyclophosphamideor Mycophenolate When corticosteroids alone have not yielded a good response after a week or if a reduction in steroids dose is desired, a second immune-suppressive agent can be used. These medications may not have steroid side effects but they have other issues of their own that must be considered. Cyclosporine is an immune modulator often used in organ transplantation. TransfusionYou might think that a transfusion of blood or at least platelet-rich plasma might be helpful in treating platelet dysfunction. The problem is that platelets do not survive well after removal from a blood donor. You have about 12 hours to deliver the freshly withdrawn blood to the recipient before the platelets become inactive. After the platelets are delivered, they are likely to live only for hours. In general, most efforts are spent on establishing immune suppression. That said, if the patient has had significant blood loss as a result of her platelet deficiency, a transfusion will certainly replace red blood cells even if it cannot effectively replace platelets. Gamma Globulin TransfusionGamma globulins are blood proteins including antibodies. Human gamma globulin appears to occupy the phagocyte antibody binding site so that coated platelets cannot be grabbed out of circulation. This has been a promising therapy for both humans and dogs but is generally prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, research has shown that results are similar to those obtained simply by using vincristine. Since a less expensive treatment exists with less potential for side effects, gamma globulin therapy is rarely used. SplenectomyIf the medication simply does not work or the condition keeps recurring once medications are discontinued, the solution may be to simply remove the spleen. After all, this is where the phagocytes removing the platelets are primarily located. In humans, immune-mediated platelet destruction is generally treated with splenectomy first. Response in dogs has not been as predictably good, thus in veterinary medicine, it is generally one of the last therapies invoked and is reserved for patients with recurrence issues. TPO Receptor Agonists (Romiplostim and Eltrombopag) Hepatic thrombopoietin is one of the factors the liver makes in response to removing old platelets from circulation. Remember, when platelet removal switches to the spleen in this disease, hepatic thrombopoietin is not generated and the bone marrow may not be properly stimulated. These two agents have revolutionized ITP treatment in humans so we bring them up here. They act by enhancing the marrow's response to hepatic thrombopoietin. The problem is that eltrombopag does not bind to canine receptors and studies of romiplostim in dogs are sparse. That said, it may not be long before research progresses and TPO receptor agonists are included in therapy. Prognosis The good news is that 70-90% of dogs with ITP will recover. Factors that bode poorly include: Treatment continues long after the patient appears to have recovered with the immune-suppressive agents tapered down slowly over several months. Recurrence occurs in approximately 30% of affected dogs and most commonly occurs after two to three months from diagnosis. When recurrence happens, medications must be stepped up. Of the dogs that suffer a recurrence, approximately 50% will suffer yet another one. Splenectomy results in permanent remission in approximately 60% of patients and is likely a good choice for a dog with a recurrence problem.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Coping with an itchy cat can be an extremely frustrating experience for you, the pet owner, and can truly test the limits of the human-animal bond.  Persistent scratching and chewing by the pet can also result in open wounds to the skin and pain to your cat.  The following information is intended to help provide pet owners with a basic understanding of the most common underlying causes of itching (pruritus) and allergies in cats. What are the most common causes of chronic itching? Itching in cats can involve not only scratching but also chewing, licking, and rubbing. The common causes of itching in cats are external parasites such asfleasandmange, allergies, and a type of fungal infection called ringworm. Although medications are available to temporarily decrease itching, it is always recommended to find outthe cause of your cat's itching. Otherwise, the itching will return as soon as the medication is stopped. Especially when used over time, some medications such as steriods can result in other health conditions. What are allergies? Allergies are a common cause of skin conditions in cats. People with allergies usually have hay fever (watery eyes, runny nose and sneezing) or asthma. Although cats withasthmacan be allergic, most cats with allergies lick or chew their fur. What are the major types of allergies in cats? Flea AllergyFlea allergic dermatitis is the most common skin disease in cats.  For the flea allergic patient,100% flea controlis essential for remaining symptom-free. “But doctor, I never see fleas on my pet.”  You may not see them, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there!  Flea allergy is caused by the flea’s saliva, and it only takes a few bites to cause a problem.  Also, the itchy pet often scratches or licks so much that adult fleas are hard to find because they are removed from the body. “If fleas are the problem, why is my pet still itchy in the winter?”  In warm climates or in our homes, fleas may survive in low numbers year-round.  Because flea allergy is so common, many veterinarians recommend instituting complete flea control before proceeding with test for itching. For most allergic pets, year-round flea treatment is an important part of reducing itch. Food AllergySome pets develop hypersensitivities to foods. Various food proteins, carbohydrates, or even preservatives or dyes can all be potential food allergens. There is currently no accurate blood or skin test to determine if your cat has a food allergy. The only method of diagnosing a food allergy is by placing your pet on a carefully selected prescription or homemade hypoallergenic diet for several weeks, which is called afood trial. The diet only contains ingredients your pet has never eaten before. If the allergy signs resolve, a food challenge is performed by feeding the former diet and watching for a return of the itching.  If this occurs, a diagnosis of food allergy is confirmed. Atopic DermatitisAtopic dermatitis(AD) is an inherited predisposition to developing skin problems from exposure to a variety of commonplace and otherwise harmless substances including the pollens of weeds, grasses and trees, as well as housedust mitesand mold spores.  In cats that have been diagnosed with AD, allergy testing by intradermal skin testing or in vitro blood testing can identify what a pet is allergic to in the environment.  Evaluating the results of these tests helps us compile a list of allergens for a “vaccine” to decrease the pet’s sensitivity. Secondary InfectionsAllergies are often the underlying cause of recurring skin and/or ear infections.  Bacterial and yeast infections, though secondary to the allergy, can increase your pet’s level of itching. Can allergies be cured? Unfortunately, there is no cure for allergy and it is usually a life-long problem. We seek to control allergies and improve the quality of life for both you and your cat.  We will formulate the best program of management that suits all involved with your cat’s care. Can itching be treated without the expense of diagnostic testing? There are many anti-allergy medications to reduce itching.  These medications do not cure allergies but can help decrease the symptoms. However, without addressing the underlying cause of the allergy, the itching will return when the medication is stopped.  Long-term use of some anti-allergy medications, such assteroids, can result in many health problems.  Working with your veterinarian to diagnose the underlying cause of the allergy and itching may reduce the need for medications or enable your veterinarian to use more specific and targeted allergy treatments.

Category: Feline Aortic Thromboembolism (FATE or Saddle Thrombus)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called saddle thrombus) One tends to feel apprehensive about a condition with the acronym FATE, and rightly so. FATE (feline aortic thromboembolism) is a dramatic and painful condition with serious implications. It comes on suddenly and appears to paralyze the cat, causing one or both rear legs to become useless and even noticeably cold. The cat will hyperventilate and cry out with extreme pain. Despite the extreme presentation, the cat may be able to recover from the episode, but it is important to understand how this came to be in order to make decisions. A thrombus is a large blood clot. An embolism is a small blood clot lodged in an unfortunate location. What is a Saddle Thrombus? A saddle thrombus is a blood clot that breaks off from a larger blood clot in the heart, travels down the aorta, and lodges at the saddle. Not only is the blood supply to one or both rear legs cut off but a metabolic cascade results, leading to the release of assorted inflammatory mediators (especially serotonin). The muscles of the rear legs become hard, the foot pads become bluish in color, and the condition is extremely painful. The inflammatory mediators readily lead to circulatory shock. The aorta is the largest artery in the body. It stems from the heart where it arches up and runs down the length of the back, ultimately splitting into the arteries supplying blood to the back legs. The split where the aorta becomes the left and right iliac arteries is called the saddle. 72 percent of cats with a saddle thrombus have both rear legs affected. Where the Saddle Thrombus Came from The saddle thrombus comes from a larger clot in the left atrium of the heart. This obviously begs the question as to why there would be a large blood clot in a cat’s heart. In fact, 89 percent of cats with a saddle thrombus have heart disease. Heart disease leads to turbulent blood flow, which encourages the formation of clots. Not every cat with heart disease will form an abnormal clot, in fact, most will not; but there is presently no clear way to predict which cats will form these clots and which ones will not. That said, there are some suggestive echo findings that are felt to predict increased risk. In cats withhypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the most common form of feline heart disease, the size of the left atrium is one factor that is considered. The presence of “smoke” in the atrium during echocardiography is another factor. (“Smoke” is the whispy material seen in the circulating blood.) Both these factors are considered controversial but when they are seen, most cardiologists will recommend some kind of therapy to reduce clotting tendency (i.e., a blood thinner). The problem is that, in order to go on preventive therapy, there has to have been a reason to see a cardiologist in the first place (heart murmur during a physical exam, heart enlargement incidentally found on a radiograph, abnormal blood test, or actual symptoms of heart disease).  The majority of cats with aortic thromboembolism have had none of these things, and the saddle thrombus is the very first symptom of a problem. In 76% of cats with saddle thrombus, the FATE episode was the first sign of heart disease. How Bad is this Situation? The outcome is variable but has the potential to be very bad. Let's review the possibilities. Best Case Scenario (Saddle Thrombus But No Concurrent Heart Failure)Cats almost never have a FATE episode unless there is an underlying heart disease, so it is not unusual for the cat in question to also have heart failure; in fact, about half of them do. This, of course, means that about half of them don't. If there is only the thrombus and its associated pain to deal with, this makes the job simpler as the goal becomes pain control until the thrombus can dissolve and circulation can be restored. That said, having a thrombus cutting off circulation to the legs can involve some very serious tissue damage and can be life-threatening in and of itself. A lot of toxic biochemicals are generated in the damaged tissue, and when the clot dissolves, these are all released into the rest of the circulation and this event can be lethal even without heart failure. The clot damage can be severe, symmetrical, and disastrous, or it can create only a partial circulatory blockage, and some improvement in function may be evident in a couple of days. Recovery of function can be complete or partial, and it may take several weeks to tell. Basically, for the cat with a thrombus and no heart failure, the take-home points are: Saddle Thrombus With Concurrent Heart FailureIn this scenario, the cat not only has the pain and paralysis of the saddle thrombus but is also in active heart failure. Even if the thrombus situation resolves relatively promptly with initial signs of limb function recovery and acceptable pain control after a couple of days, there is still a life-threatening cardiac crisis to contend with. The heart failure alone may be lethal in the short term, but let's assume the heart failure can be controlled quickly with medication AND the recovery from the thrombus is in progress. The cat will need heart medication, blood thinners, and nursing care while the rear legs recover. The median survival of saddle thrombus cats with heart failure is 77 days, while the median survival of saddle thrombus cats without heart failure is 223 days. Tissue Damage from ThrombusThe good news is that permanent limb damage is the exception and not the rule, but it is possible. Some cats will lose skin or even muscle from the circulatory compromise. About 5% of cats will have tissue damage appearing as an open wound. As circulation returns, this sort of injury should heal. Another 5 percent will have more serious damage, and the occasional cat will require amputation of a limb. Rapid Death from the Tissue Damage or Heart FailureMany cats will die in the hospital. Some are simply overcome by heart failure. Some will throw another blood clot or multiple clots to a less survivable location, such as the brain or lung blood vessels. Some will suffer what is called a reperfusion injury when, as circulation returns to the limbs, toxic biochemicals from the limbs enter the main body of the circulation. Large amounts of potassium released from dying cells can be enough to fibrillate the already diseased heart. A saddle thrombus is a serious event. Is it likely to be lethal? It turns out the best predictive parameter is the body temperature at the time of presentation to the hospital. Cats with an initial body temperature over 98.9⁰F have a greater than 50 percent chance of avoiding this disaster and getting well enough to return home. EuthanasiaBecause of the potential for repeat saddle thrombus episodes, the need for regular medication administration at home, and the potential long-term treatment of heart disease, not to mention the seriousness & painfulness of the cat’s initial predicament, approximately 50-75% of pet owners elect euthanasia without attempting treatment. Some Statistics What to Expect at the Hospital The doctor will need to quickly determine if the cat has a saddle thrombus or some other reason for rear limb paralysis and pain. The saddle thrombus patient will have cold rear feet, with a bluish or purplish color of the pads when compared to the front feet. Sometimes a toenail will be clipped short on a rear toe to check for bleeding. The diagnosis is often clinched by comparing a blood glucose level taken from the front of the body against one taken from the rear legs. Pain control is generally initiated while these preliminary evaluations are being performed. Obviously, the initial body temperature is recorded so as to assist in making a prognosis and assessing the severity of the situation. Once the cat is more comfortable, more comprehensive blood testing can be performed and chest radiographs can be taken. In doing this, the cat is assessed for kidney toxins, toxins related to poor circulation, general biochemical body function, stress, heart failure, and possible lung cancer. If heart failure is present, diuretics will be needed to relieve extra fluid from the circulation and ease the burden on the weakened heart. There is controversy about using injectable blood thinners, but many hospitals will begin them and later transition to oralclopidogrel,aspirinor both. Most cats will present to their regular veterinarian's office for initial care. The question will arise as to whether 24-hour care is needed or likely to be worth the extra expense, stress of travel to a specialty center, etc. The benefit of the specialty center includes the ability to continue pain-relieving medications overnight and to watch for and address sudden exacerbations with regard to heart failure or new embolisms. The cat will also need an assessment by a veterinary cardiologist to assess the underlying heart disease and prescribe medications as indicated. Many specialty centers will have a cardiologist on-site so this is another reason to transfer sooner rather than later. Of course, not every community has a specialty center conveniently located so the echocardiogram may need to be addressed by a mobile specialist, by telemedicine (over the internet), or even by a skilled non-specialist. The cat will need to be hospitalized for at least a couple of days and possibly for as long as a week for pain management and to establish comfort and appetite before release from the hospital. Owners will need to be able to give medication and nursing care as needed. Saddle Thrombus in the Absence of Heart Disease We have discussed saddle thrombus in terms of heart disease so far but it turns out there are other ways to get an aortic thromboembolism. While 89 percent of cats have heart disease, 6 percent will have cancer, and 3 percent will have no apparent reason for their thrombus. The cats with cancer usually have lung cancer, which is discovered when chest radiographs are taken to assess heart disease. Lung cancer is not the only type of tumor that can induce a state promoting inappropriate clotting, though, so if heart disease is not found, a tumor search should be initiated with abdominal ultrasound. In this scenario, obviously the cat must contend with the thrombus recovery and medication to prevent future embolism, PLUS the newly discovered cancer and whatever treatments are available to address that.

Category: Myeloma-Related Disorders in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What are Myeloma-related Disorders? Myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells. Plasma cells are specialized lymphocytes, i.e. they are part of the white blood cell group and are key components of the immune system. In the healthy individual, plasma cells are responsible for making antibodies and help protect against disease. Plasma cells that become cancerous are known as myeloma cells. A broad spectrum of different clinical signs may develop as myeloma cells proliferate, making this a difficult and challenging disease to diagnose and treat. Currently reported feline myeloma-related disorders include: Otto Kahler (1849-1893), a physician from Prague, is accredited with the first medical description of myeloma in humans.  Incidentally, the word myeloma is derived from two parts: myelo from the Greek word muelos meaning marrow, and oma, a Greek suffix commonly used to denote a tumor. The first description of myeloma in cats was not used until 1957 and was published by Holzworth & Meier from the Angel Memorial Animal Hospital in Boston. Many more reports on this condition now exist, but overall the myeloma-related disorders are relatively rare tumours in cats. What Signs are seen with Myeloma-related Disorders? Symptoms can vary tremendously within the same patient over time, as well as between patients. Clinical signs are dependent upon the location(s) the myeloma cell is proliferating in, as well as signs attributable to the excess production of antibodies by these cancerous myeloma cells. Furthermore, these tumors show differing patterns of clinical signs between different animal species. Cats with myeloma commonly have anemia and this can contribute to the lethargy and weakness that may be seen. The cancerous myeloma cells typically produce immunoglobulins (monoclonal antibodies), which are often referred to as a paraprotein or M-protein. Filtration of the paraprotein by the kidneys leads to abnormal kidney function and even kidney failure. Excessive levels of paraprotein increase the “thickness” of the blood and result in hyperviscosity syndromes that may damage the eye (causing blindness), the nervous system (causing nerve or brain signs), the heart (cardiomyopathy), or in blood clotting (bleeding tendencies). The myeloma cells can congregate in clumps in various internal organs (e.g. in cats, the liver and/or spleen are commonly affected) or within skin, causing isolated tumors (or plasmacytomas), that can interfere with the normal function of these organs or the surrounding area. If the myeloma cells proliferate in the marrow - as happens in some cats, but is more common in human patients or dogs -  then destruction of bone can be seen (also known as osteolysis) causing bone pain or even fractures. Myeloma cells can also disturb the control of key body chemicals (such as calcium metabolism). Patients with myeloma can also be immunosuppressed and have a reduced ability to fight infections. Treatment and Survival in Myeloma-related Disorders Before commencing treatment, a complete diagnostic work-up is strongly recommended. The goal in treating multiple myeloma is to improve quality of life, relieve symptoms and pain if present, and to prolong survival. Complete cure has not been reported. Complete remission (meaning the alleviation of clinical signs) can be achieved. In one report, the majority of cats responded to combination chemotherapy and these cats had a median survival time of 12 months, which is not dissimilar to some reports for the treatment of standard lymphoma. Disease control is usually eventually complicated by a tendency for myeloma cells to become resistant to anti-cancer drugs. What should I do if Myeloma is Suspected in my Pet? Complete investigations for myeloma-related disorders are complex and may take several days. Ideally, referral to a veterinary oncologist in a multi-disciplinary specialist centre is in the best interests of the patient.

Category: Neonatal Isoerythrolysis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Neonatal isoerythrolysis, or NI, is a rare immune-mediated disease that is caused when newborn kittens with type A blood drink colostrum from a mother with type B blood. The antibodies contained in the colostrum are absorbed. They then bind to the kitten's erythrocytes (red blood cells) and destroy them (erythrolysis, hemolysis). Blood type A is dominant over blood type B, therefore type A cats can either be homozygous (genotype AA) or heterozygous (genotype AB). Tomcats that are homozygous type A will always produce type A kittens when bred to queens with type A or B blood. Approximately 95% of type B queens have strong isoantibodies against type A blood. Affected kittens are born healthy and start to nurse vigorously. Once they drink the colostrum, they start to show clinical signs within hours to days, stop nursing, and fail to thrive. They develop hemolytic anemia within one to two days after birth and some or all of the litter will die. Early clinical signs of the disease are pigmenturia (dark red-brown urine). Affected kittens will be anemic, jaundiced, and depressed. Immune mediated hemolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and anemia are the probable causes of death. Blood tests, urinalysis, and blood typing can diagnosis the condition. Pigmenturia in fading kittens is highly diagnostic for NI. Affected or at-risk kittens should not be permitted to nurse from their mother for the first three days. A blood type A queen can be substituted for nursing, or a milk replacer can be used for the first three days after birth. The kittens can be returned to their mother after three days, because the colostrum will no longer be present at that point. Even if the kittens are removed from their mother as soon as the first clinical signs develop, the mortality rate will be high. NI is best prevented by avoiding incompatible matings between type B mothers and type A fathers. Cord blood can be used to determine the kitten's blood type or to perform a crossmatch with serum from the mother. Kittens with blood type B can be immediately placed back with their queen. Type A (or AB) kittens may safely receive milk or colostrum from a type A mother. Prevention is the preferred "treatment" for NI. Affected kittens need supportive care, blood transfusions, etc.; however the prognosis is guarded in spite of any treatment, so prevention should be the main key of defense.

Category: Neonatal Isoerythrolysis in Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Imagine this tragic scenario. A mother cat carries her litter normally and gives birth to a healthy litter of kittens. She cleans them, nurses them, cares for them but within a few days they have all weakened and died. This may happen litter after litter with the cattery breeder wondering what went wrong. While there are many reasons why newborn kittens might not survive, this particular condition is preventable. Neonatal isoerythrolysis is a tragedy among breeders of kittens and is often written off as infectious disease, genetic defects, or simply natural selection. In fact, it is simply a matter of mismatched blood typing. A Human Example: Rh Disease Many of us know our blood type: it is either A, B, O, or AB and comes with a negative or positive after it. It is the negative or positive that is important when it comes to HUMAN isoerythrolysis. The negative or positive in your blood type refers to whether you are negative or positive for a red blood cell protein called Rh factor, named for the Rhesus monkeys used in initial studies of this disease. Problems do not occur when both parents are Rh positive or Rh negative, or even when the father is Rh negative and the mother is Rh positive. Problems occur with a certain combination. When a man who is positive for Rh factor fathers a child with a woman who is negative for Rh factor, the child will be Rh positive. When the mother gives birth, her immune system becomes exposed to the baby’s blood. Her immune system mounts a response against Rh factor and soon she is armed with anti-Rh factor antibodies. This is not a problem for the first-born child. It is secondary children who are in danger. When the mother is pregnant again with another Rh positive child, the antibodies of her bloodstream cross the placenta and destroy her unborn child’s developing red blood cells. The unborn child will likely die. Luckily, this condition is preventable by first being aware of your Rh status when you become pregnant, and by receiving a product called RhIg when the first child is born. RhIg is an anti-Rh factor antibody that destroys any Rh factor entering the mother’s body at the time of the first birth. The Rh factor is destroyed before the mother’s immune system “sees it,” thus preventing her from producing the antibodies that would attack her second child’s blood. See more information onhuman Rhdisease. The Feline Disease Cats do not have Rh factor but a similar parental blood mismatch can occur involving the feline blood types A, B, and AB blood. Cats with type A blood naturally carry antibodies against type B blood and cats with type B blood naturally have antibodies against type A blood. These antibodies do not need exposure to another cat's blood during birth (as with human Rh disease) or from an incompatible transfusion; those antibodies are just naturally there, ready to attack the opposite blood type. It turns out that only some type A cats carry anti-B antibodies and the the ones that do only carry small amounts. On the other hand, all type B cats carry a lot of anti-A antibodies. When a type B mother cat is carrying a litter of type A kittens, the stage is set for disaster. In people, antibodies cross the placenta and cause damage to the unborn baby. In cats, the placenta blocks the antibodies and protects the litter but there is no natural protection once they are born and have to nurse their type B mother's milk. More specifically, the problem happens when they nurse their mother's colostrum, which is naturally loaded with antibodies aimed at destroying type A red blood cells. The feline A,B,AB system is not comparable to the human A,B,O blood typing system. In people, inheriting a Type A gene and a Type B gene creates Type AB blood. In the cat, the Type A is dominant to all other blood types. Any Type A genes will create a Type A cat. This means that when a Type A cat is bred to a Type B cat, each kitten has at least a 50% chance of being Type A. What is Colostrum? Colostrum is milk produced by the mother of any mammal species for the first 12-24 hours or so. The first day of life is extra special for baby mammals as this is the time when the mother gives them a copy of her own immunity. The milk produced in this period is rich with all the antibodies the mother has to give: vaccination-generated antibodies, antibodies from exposure to all sorts of proteins she has experienced or infections she has survived, and, of course, antibodies against the “wrong” blood type. The infant’s intestine is in a sensitive time during this period. The antibodies delivered in the mother’s colostrum are not digested like regular proteins; instead, they are absorbed intact and provide the basis for the baby’s protection against infectious disease until the baby’s immune system is mature enough to make its own antibodies. After the first day of life, the intestine achieves what is called closure and no more such absorption takes place. After closure, any proteins that enter the GI tract are broken down as nutrients. The Type B mother cat is giving a great big dose of anti-A antibodies right into her Type A kittens with her colostrum and the babies are absorbing it into their bodies. The antibodies destroy the kittens’ developing red blood cells; they get pale, perhaps even jaundiced. They get weaker and weaker and then they die, poisoned by their own mother’s milk. Prevention and Saving the Litter As with human Rh disease, the first step in prevention is awareness. If you are going to breed purebred cats, have their blood types tested before they are bred. This can be done at the vet’s office with a test kit and can often be done while you wait. Ideally, a type B mother cat would only be bred to a type B tomcat. Type B feline blood is somewhat unusual in the mixed-breed domestic short hair population, but it is fairly common in purebred cats, particularly the Asian breeds. Type A is genetically dominant to type B so that the mating of a type B mother to a type A father will produce at least a 50 percent chance of type A kitten. So what do we do about the kittens already on the way? The key to survival is to keep the kittens from drinking their mother’s colostrum. As soon as they are born, they must be removed from the mother cat and either nursed by another mother cat or bottle-fed (seeOrphan Kitten Carefor full instructions). They can be returned to their real mother after her colostrum production is over. This ought to be 12-18 hours but keep them away for a full day just to be sure. Regular mother’s milk produced after this time is not a hazard as the antibodies will be digested by the babies. During that first 24-hour period, the kittens may nurse on a Type A mother cat or can be bottled or tube fed. As for the immunity lost by giving up colostrum, there is a next best thing: a plasma transfusion. Feline plasma of the correct blood type can be given to the kittens by injection. (Kittens can be blood typed using cord or placenta blood if one wishes to avoid a needle stick in such a tiny patient.) This blood product will contain many protective antibodies and none of the harmful ones. It is not as good as type-matched colostrum, but is fairly available in most animal blood banks. Sick kittens may survive if they are given blood transfusions but the problem is knowing which blood type to use. The kittens want type A blood but if their mother's antibodies are still present, this will not work. The proper treatment is going to depend on how old the kittens are at the time of diagnosis. If they are less than 3 days of age, a transfusion of their mother's type B red blood cells may be the best choice even though the kittens are type A. Blood Typing Feline blood typing can be performed by most animal hospitals. If a litter of kittens is planned, see your veterinarian about at least typing the mother cat so that you can plan ahead for complications. Neonatal isoerythrolysis is a preventable syndrome but only if it is anticipated.

Everyone reading this is a mammal (unless you are a particularly sentient anemone, coelacanth or axolotl), and one of the things that pegs us as mammals and unites us all is…well, boobs. Yes, even the men and boys. Boob-bearers, all of us. Let me explain. But it still seems to shock people to learn that dogs, cats, rabbits, rats and a host of other domestic species can get breast cancer, too. Since the aim of Breast Cancer Awareness Month is to raise awareness, our aim here is to wave the flag for those who can’t speak for themselves and raise awareness of mammary cancer in companion animals. We also want people to know that breast cancer and mammary gland cancer are the same disease; it’s just called by a different name in other species. Check out the poster we created for use in veterinary hospitals that we hope will help pet owners understand that they're the same.As a pre-amble ‒ and the way this is going it could be a "pre-ramble" ‒ October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I think people are fairly keyed in to the fact that humans can get breast cancer, or mammary cancer, as it is called in companion animals; its gnarled and potentially deadly hand has touched the lives of many of you, I presume. My own mother had surgery to have a tumor removed that was, luckily, low grade. Some numbers may help to illustrate the risks to dogs and cats. For humans, breast cancer happens more frequently in more developed countries, and accounts for about 10 percent of all deaths in women between 20 and 59 (source: World Health Organization). Data for dogs and cats and other domestic species are harder to come by as there is no World Doggy Health Organization database to be accessed as easily as WHO data, but estimates are that 1 in 4 dogs who are not spayed and experience more than one heat cycle will develop mammary tumors. Those stakes are high enough that Vegas would avoid this bet like the plague. Happily, for dogs or cats who are spayed before they are sexually mature (the usual timeframe for a spay is before 6 months of age) mammary cancer is virtually unheard of. Learn more about the specifics of the disease and treatment indogsandcats. The terminology surrounding lumps, tumors and cancer can be a little daunting sometimes, and is often a source of confusion. One thing to keep in mind is that the word tumor does not always mean cancer. Cancer implies malignancy, or a predilection to grow rapidly and spread to other parts of the body: it’s a process known as metastasis, in which a tumor says, in essence, I’m outta here and decides to infiltrate new and exciting regions for growth. A tumor can be benign or malignant, but cancer is always malignant. So how do we know which lump is bad, and which is not likely to be a problem for our pets? Sadly, there’s no easy way. Any lump found on a pet’s mammary gland has the potential to be cancerous, so having your veterinarian remove the lump (or a piece of it, in what is known as an incisional biopsy) and submit it for analysis is an important part of keeping your pets safe from this disease. A biopsy is a piece of tissue that can be preserved and looked at under a microscope by a pathologist to determine what the lump is (mammary tissue vs. some other tissue that just decided on a whim to form a lump) and whether the lump is cancerous, or as doctors call it, malignant. You can’t tell if tissue is cancerous just by the way it looks, how it feels or where it is.There is one intermediate step that can offer information to your veterinarian on how extensive or radical surgery to remove the lump should be. This is known as a fine needle aspirate, or FNA. With an FNA, you don’t get a piece of the mass, you just suck some cells up into the needle and place them onto a slide. It is much less invasive and doesn’t usually require any sedation or anesthesia, but the trade-off is that it is a less accurate test and less likely than a surgical biopsy to tell you the badness level of the tumor. An FNA is actually notoriously unreliable for mammary masses as far as predicting malignancy but can help make sure the lump is from mammary tissue and not something else that set up shop in the same area. Medicine is often like that – the invasive stuff is the most accurate, and the easiest stuff gives you the least useable information. It’s like food where the good stuff tastes bad and the stuff that tastes great kills you.  The universe can seem like a vast, cruel joke some days. I know this sounds complex, intimidating and potentially invasive – not to mention expensive. The good news is that the take-home on this is pretty simple: spay your pet before she goes into heat, unless you have a rock-solid breeding plan for your purebred pet, and have your veterinarian check out any suspicious lumps. That’s about it. Luckily, your trusted family veterinarian has the skills and knowledge to guide you and your pet through this maze to ensure the highest degree of success.

Category: Cancer is a Cellular Delinquent
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Like people, our pets’ bodies develop cancer cells throughout their lifetime. In the lucky ones, these cells remain dormant and no malignancy ever grows; in others, the cells go mad systematically. The cellular delinquents bust past the body’s natural immune system, as though a gate was left open, burgeoning into abnormal cells. They do not surrender to a healthy cell’s programmed death, so the cellular delinquents multiply as they crowd out healthy cells. They don’t follow any rules and ignore signals that they are overfilling the place. For nourishment, they cause new blood vessels to form to supply them, which should be supplying healthy tissue. These marauding delinquents can grow anywhere in our pets’ bodies, just like us: lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, intestines, bone, blood, brain, skin, muscle, mouth, nail beds, and so on. What signs of cancer can we look for in our pets? They range from subtle to more obvious that something is going wrong. Signs of cancer can be similar to ones seen in other diseases, so don’t assume your pet has cancer if you see one. Also don’t assume that age alone is causing lethargy or lack of playfulness. If your pet has one or more of these signs, it’s time for a visit to the veterinarian: catching any disease process early is best because it’s easier to treat.  With cancer, early detection can sometimes make the difference between good health at a reasonable cost and an expensive illness that may include death.

Category: Cutaneous Lymphoma in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Lymphoma is common in cats, but is seen in so many ways and different places that it is confusing. It can be seen in almost any organ. When it affects the skin, it is called cutaneous lymphoma. Lymphocytes, or lymph cells, are white blood cells and part of the immune system. Lymphocytes travel throughout the body. Some lymphocytes line organs to provide immunity against infection. When the lymphocytes become malignant with cutaneous lymphoma, however, skin tumors can develop almost anywhere on the skin. Besides the haired parts of the skin, these tumors can be seen at the lip margins, the eyelids, the anus/rectum, the vulva, and the prepuce of the penis (the fold of skin covering the penis). A specific, poorly understood form of cutaneous lymphoma seems to occur near the hock, which is the ankle of a back leg. A cat can also have skin tumors and lymphoma elsewhere in the body at the same time; often it's seen in the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, kidneys, mouth, or nasal passages. As with non-cutaneous lymphoma in cats, each case is different. The disease is complex and there are several forms of it. Unfortunately, there is no overall consensus from the veterinary community on what the best course of action is in any individual cat. The cause is unknown in most cases. Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus can cause lymphoma in cats, but don’t seem to be involved in most cases of cutaneous lymphoma. Lymphoma in cats can rarely happen at a vaccine site, but mostvaccine-associated tumorsare other kinds of cancer, not lymphoma. Cutaneous lymphoma can look like skin nodules, masses, ulcers, or just areas of skin that are flaky, bald, or changed in color. Some of the skin tumors can be large.  As time goes on, the skin often becomes thick, red, ulcerated, and may ooze fluid. Cats can also have signs of internal disease such as swollen lymph nodes, a lack of appetite, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, and general weakness. For diagnosis, a piece of tissue is taken from the skin tumor, usually with either a biopsy or a fine needle aspirate. It is examined under the microscope. Cutaneous lymphoma can look like some other skin diseases, so enough testing must be done to ensure accuracy. Blood tests and a urinalysis may be needed. More tests like X-rays, ultrasound, or tissue samples may be used to see if other organs besides the skin are involved. Treatment is much like other cancers. Surgery can sometimes remove skin masses or lesions. This surgery can be useful to get tissue to make the diagnosis. If the cat is lucky and the lymphoma is ONLY at one place on the skin, surgery may also help for treatment, but this situation is rare. It’s much more common for lymphoma to involve lots of different organs at once. Even if only the skin is affected, there are usually too many sites for surgery to help. Chemotherapy is the main form of treatment for that reason as it can help multiple areas of the body at once. If all goes well, it can be really effective at reducing the lesions even in a short time, although this result may not last. Radiation may occasionally be helpful for skin lesions occurring in just one spot. Rarely, cases with lymphoma in multiple spots on the skin have also been treated with a superficial form of radiation that treats the skin without affecting deeper organs. Corticosteroids pills such asprednisoloneare often part of chemotherapy for cutaneous lymphoma. If the corticosteroids are used by themselves when more effective therapy isn’t an option, they may give some temporary relief. Sadly, there is no cure and the long-term prognosis is poor. However, chemotherapy can slow progression and temporarily improve a cat’s quality of life. On average, cats treated for cutaneous lymphoma will only survive for less than a year. Some cats live longer, though, and cats whose disease starts out at only one spot might be likely to do better.

Category: Injection Site Sarcoma (Cancer) in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Also called vaccine-associated fibrosarcoma and vaxosarcoma. Back in the 1990s, researchers began to take note of locally aggressive tumors developing in the feline scruff of the neck, where vaccinations and therapeutic injections were typically given. The idea that vaccination (and potentially other types of injections) might occasionally cause cancer began to circulate in the feline medical community. By 1997, a task force was assembled to study the situation and make recommendations. We have come a long way since this time. What should you know about the feline injection site sarcoma (FISS) situation? What Is an Injection Site Sarcoma and Why Do We Think Vaccination Might Cause it? Soft tissue sarcomas have been recognized as difficult, deeply rooted tumors in cats for a long time, long before injections were ever involved. There are many types of soft tissue sarcomas, with fibrosarcoma being one of the most common. The fibrosarcoma is a tumor that does not usually spread throughout the body in the way we usually think of cancer; instead, it digs in deeply and widely in a localized area. After surgical removal, it is notorious for recurring even more aggressively than before.Distant spread does occur but much later in the course of the disease. Fibrosarcomas have been recognized for a very long time, but the potential for vaccination to lead to the formation of a fibrosarcoma is a relatively new concern. The idea that cats could develop a sarcoma associated with vaccination began to receive attention when some of the following facts emerged: Reports of sarcomas stemming from other injections followed, and it is now accepted that chronic inflammation concentrated in a small area is the root of the feline injection site sarcoma. Killed virus vaccine especially creates the exact scenario that can create sarcoma in an individual with the right predisposition for it. Despite the extremely low incidence of this problem, the problem is still serious, and the veterinary profession has responded with numerous studies on how vaccines might be related to tumor formation, why the incidence is so low given how many vaccines are given to cats annually, and what can be done for prevention. The vaccination uses a modified version of the virus to stimulate the immune system against the natural infectious virus. The modified virus can be alive but weakened, or it can be killed. (Recombinant vaccines are a story for another time.) A modified live virus will circulate through the body in a natural way typical of the infectious virus. As it moves through the body, it stimulates the immune response but doesn't generate illness. A killed virus vaccine presents the virus to the immune system, but the virus is dead and doesn't replicate, bind anywhere, or do anything that a live virus might do to stimulate immunity. In fact, the body will tend to clear out the dead virus as it clears out other microscopic debris, and if this happens too quickly, a quality immune stimulation will not result. To see that this does not happen, adjuvants are added to hold the dead virus in place and attract the attention of the immune system. This kind of stimulation can lead to localized inflammation in the vaccination area; one theory is that this inflammation is what leads to precancerous changes in the local cells. Indeed, some fibrosarcomas have been found to have vaccine adjuvants embedded within them. Every manufacturer of killed virus vaccines (which in cats are typically rabies vaccine and feline leukemia vaccine) makes its own adjuvant, and no single adjuvant has been implicated in the sarcoma phenomenon. Current thinking is that the cat's genetic makeup is just as important in determining if this kind of inflammation can lead to a pre-cancerous change in the tissue. Most cats do not generate cancer from localized inflammation: it takes the "right" cat and the "right" vaccine. How Often Does This Happen?Happily, not very often.  Sarcoma incidence is extremely rare, with different studies reporting an incidence between one in 1000 to one in 10,000 vaccines given. To put this in perspective, using the traditional vaccination guidelines a cat would receive three vaccines annually during their 15-year lifespan for a total of 45 vaccines, not including the initial kitten series. In other words, a typical cat would receive 45 vaccines in its lifetime, and a sarcoma erupts in 1000-10,000 vaccines. Now that we have some prevention strategies, the incidence is likely to be even less. It can take as short a time as two months and as long as 10 years to develop a vaccine site tumor, but most appear within four years of the offending injection. While most (80 percent) of the tumors that develop are fibrosarcomas, other types of tumors that can develop through this phenomenon include: All are tumors of muscle, bone, cartilage, or fat. Should I Still Vaccinate My Cat?What Has Been Done about this Problem? Vaccination remains one of the most important aspects of preventive care for cats, and the risk of tumor development was already low before new policies were developed to make it even lower. So, yes, you should still vaccinate your cat. To minimize the risk even further, there have been several developments in vaccination.  For example, vaccinations are made differently now. Instead of the simple modified live versus killed option, we now have recombinant vaccinations that allow a live non-adjuvanted approach to vaccination against diseases like rabies and feline leukemia virus. These are preferentially used over the adjuvanted killed vaccines that have been heavily implicated in sarcoma formation. Some vaccines are given in a needle-free manner (such as nasally) to avoid creating a depot of vaccine in the muscle and skin tissues. Vaccines are divided into core vaccines that all cats should have regardless of their indoor/outdoor lifestyle (rabies and FVRCP distemper vaccines are considered core), while other vaccines are given depending on the cat's realistic risk of exposure. Vaccines are now given in specific locations so as to control how much inflammation occurs in a given spot. You can also read a summary of the2020 vaccination guidelines for catsfrom the American Association of Feline Practitioners. Guidelines for Preventing Injection Site Sarcoma Avoid Unnecessary VaccinationBe wary of vaccination recommendations that encourage you to vaccinate for every possible disease. Recommendations are highly regional and individualized according to the philosophy of your veterinarian, and they all may have a different philosophy, but the guidelines developed by the American Veterinary Medical Association, and the American Association of Feline Practitioners, are a good place to start (see link above). Use Live Vaccine when PossibleLive virus vaccines do not employ adjuvant to stimulate the immune system. Because there is a live vaccine involved, a more natural approximation of the infection is achieved, and this stimulates the immune system much better than any adjuvant. The vaccine that has traditionally involved killed viruses (feline leukemia and rabies) can be given in a recombinant form, which means a harmless virus is used to carry the relevant DNA from the target virus through the body. In this way, a live virus is used, but the actual virus of the infection is not, just pieces of its DNA. This sophisticated method is widely used to vaccinate cats against rabies and feline leukemia virus. Vaccinations Should go in Standardized AreasEach type of injection and type of vaccine has been assigned an area on the cat's body to be given. This system not only helps researchers track which vaccines are associated with which tumors but also separates administration zones so that inflammation from multiple injections does not add together in one spot.  Accepted vaccination guidelines recommend giving vaccines in the areas shown, using the lower limbs or even the tail.  These areas have been selected so that, in case a tumor develops, the central body is not involved, and amputating the affected part is possible.  This sounds like a radical surgery, and it is; however, fibrosarcoma is a very aggressive and malignant tumor and extreme measures are generally needed to control it. Should a tumor develop, a really wide excision is needed: simply removing the visible "bump" is not going to be helpful in the long term. The 3-2-1 RuleBe aware of lumps forming after vaccination (the 3-2-1 Rule). Lumps commonly form in the weeks following vaccination due to the immune stimulation and inflammation centered on this area. These lumps are usually normal and do not represent fibrosarcomas (which generally take years to develop, not weeks). If your cat develops one of these lumps under the skin (they are generally noticed by owners 3-4 weeks after vaccination), the lump may be left alone to resolve naturally. If the lump is still there three months from the time of vaccination, it should be removed and biopsied. Any lumps bigger than 2 cm in diameter (approximately one inch) should be removed no matter how much time has passed since vaccination. Also, any lump should be biopsied if it seems to be getting larger rather than smaller one month after its discovery. (3-2-1 refers to three months post-vaccine, two cm in size, and growing bigger after one month.) Sometimes one such lump will break open. This event usually means there is an infection rather than that a fibrosarcoma has developed. Treatment for Vaccine-Associated Fibrosarcomas Injection site sarcomas can be thought of as being similar to an octopus in structure. There is the body that you see, but also far-reaching tentacles that cannot be seen extending far from the visible tumor body. For surgery to be successful, a broad excision is needed, and it is necessary to first determine how far the tumor has spread. Chest radiographs are vital for staging, and CT scanning, if available, is helpful in detecting the extent of the invisible tentacles. If CT scanning is not available, 5 cm (approximately two inches) should be removed around the visible portion of the tumor in all directions, including any bones. Basic blood work, including a feline leukemia virus test, is needed to fully assess the cat for treatment. If it is possible to remove two inches in all directions around the visible tumor (and consider for a moment how large a volume of tissue this is), the median survival time is two and a half years. The problem is that unless the sarcoma is on a limb that can be amputated, it will not be possible to remove that much of the cat's body. If the complete tumor is not removed, it is almost certainly going to grow back. This situation is where radiation therapy can help a great deal. Whether this should be done before the surgery or after remains controversial and depends on the tumor grade and location. Radiation before surgery can shrink the tumor so as to make surgery more effective. Radiation after surgery can clean up bits of tumor not removed in surgery but must be delayed until the surgery site has healed, and delay can be a problem. Radiation can also be used for palliation, which means the goal is slowing tumor growth rather than curing it; it also means less radiation side effects and expense. Chemotherapy is sometimes used with radiation and surgery, depending on the grade of the tumor and its location. Your veterinarian may not feel comfortable treating this issue and may refer you to an oncologist to get the most up-to-date treatment. Our goal here is to create awareness of an emerging problem in veterinary medicine, not to elicit panic. We believe that intelligent decisions about pet ownership require information and education. What Happens if you Don't do Anything? Early in the course of this tumor's growth, the tumor is a relatively small yet firm growth on the cat's body, neck or leg. It will probably not be bothering the cat much at this stage, but, as we have discussed, even early in its course this tumor will have far-reaching tentacles whose grasp is deeper and stronger every day. If the tumor is incompletely removed, it is likely to grow back more aggressively. If the tumor is left to progress, it will continue its growth until the skin cannot cover it and it bursts forth. By that time, it will be painful, weepy, stinky, and infected. Surgery will no longer be an option, but it is possible that palliative radiotherapy (radiation) might create some control on a temporary basis. How long does it take to go from a firm lump with good life quality to an infected mass with poor life quality? On average about six months. Curative treatment is disfiguring and expensive, but currently, it is the only means of addressing this tumor. Our goal is to create awareness of an emerging problem in veterinary medicine.

Category: Lymphoma
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Lymphoma, also called lymphosarcoma, is a highly malignant tumor of the lymph system.It is one of the most common forms of cancer in both humans and small animals. Presumably you are here because your pet is suspected of having this form of cancer. Perhaps the diagnosis has already been confirmed. In either case, you want to know more and there turns out to be much more to know. Because lymphoma is a common form of cancer in humans, research and new development in this area abounds. Animal patients as well as human patients have benefitted from this research. What is the Lymph System? The lymph system is a network of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes through which foreign proteins and disease organisms are circulated. The lymph nodes serve as processing centers where these foreign substances may be presented to the cells of the immune system. There are many different types of immune-related cells; some produce antibodies, some circulate and destroy the foreign materials they encounter, and some regulate the activity of other cells. Lymphocytes are the primary cells of the lymph system and they act in the various ways mentioned. The lymph vessels serve as a circulatory path for lymphocytes in addition to serving as a collection system directing foreign substances toward the lymph nodes. Lymph vessels interface with the blood stream at several areas allowing lymphocytes greater area to patrol. In many ways, the lymph system is similar to a second circulatory system in the body, one that circulates lymph fluid instead of blood. What is Cancer? Cancer occurs when a normal cell “goes wrong.” The cell’s normal regulatory processes disengage and it begins to divide quickly and without control. These cells do not stop at barriers, nor do they stop growing when they outgrow their own blood supply. They divide over and over, taking over local tissues and escaping to spread to other body areas. The organ to which the original cell belonged is destroyed as the cancer cells obliterate its structure. Other local tissues may also become invaded as the tumor cells grow inexorably into them. Cancer cells break off the primary tumor and travel via blood or lymph vessels to new areas of the body. Wherever these cells lodge, they may start new tumors far from the original tumor but just as deadly. This process continues until there is not enough normal tissue left to sustain life. This form of cancer spread is called metastasis. What is Lymphoma? When lymphocytes become cancerous within a lymph node, the node swells and hardens. Malignant lymphocytes readily travel through the lymph vessels to other nearby lymph nodes. When nearby nodes have been infiltrated, the cancerous lymphocytes continue their journey through the lymphatic system to distant lymph nodes. Soon all the nodes are enlarged. Other organs that harbor lymph tissues (liver, spleen and even the GI tract) can become infiltrated. Ultimately, the bone marrow, where most blood cells are formed, is affected, the immune system is destroyed, and severe anemia and weakness claim the victim's life. Without treatment, animals with lymphoma are expected to live 4-8 weeks from the time of diagnosis. Most patients (especially dogs) are not feeling particularly sick at the time of diagnosis. It may be tempting to hold off on treatment until the pet seems more ill. Waiting can drastically reduce the chance for long-term survival; better remission quality is obtained if the patient is treated while he/she still feels healthy. What is Staging? Cancer, including lymphoma is staged depending on how many body areas are involved. The more localized the cancer is, the lower the stage. The more areas are involved, the higher the stage. The stages of lymphoma are: Stage I: involvement of a single lymph nodeStage II: involvement of lymph nodes on only one side of the diaphragm (in either only the front half or only the back half of the body)Stage III: generalized involvement of peripheral lymph nodes, including both the cranial (above the waist) and caudal (below the waist) halves of the bodyStage IV: involvement of liver and/or spleenStage V: involvement of bone marrow, central nervous system or some other unusual location. The good news is that response to treatment in lymphoma is not affected by stage until the last stage is reached. Lymphoma staging also involves substaging, which includes determining if the patient is feeling healthy (substage A) or sick (substage B). Substage A carries a much better prognosis and response to treatment versus substage B. Obviously everyone wants to find their pet has potential for a long remission. This will mostly be determined by the what body part is involved, whether the patient feels sick or not, whether there are additional secondary problems (such as kidney failure as in renal lymphoma, or elevated blood calcium levels), and whether prior treatment might have made the tumor resistant to other treatments. What is Remission? Remission is the state where cancer is not detectable in the patient and the patient feels completely normal. (Note that this state is different from a cure, where the cancer is considered to be gone forever.) Prolonged remission is the goal of cancer therapy which, for most lymphoma cases, means chemotherapy. This may sound intimidating but chemotherapy for pets is not the same experience as it is for humans. For example, nausea and hair loss are generally uncommon for pets. Keep in mind that humans want a remission measured in decades if possible and most pets only need several years. This makes chemotherapy a different experience for pets. For any patient, there is an approximately 75% chanceof achieving remission no matter which protocol is used. Because lymphoma cells are quite sensitive to chemotherapy medications, there is an excellent chance of reducing the tumor to undetectable levels. How long a remission lasts depends on what protocol is used and a number of other factors. To learn more about where your pet fits into the statistics, please review the section on lymphoma in your pet's species. Numerous protocols are available and there is one to potentially fit every budget and every schedule. What is the Cure? Cure is the permanent removal of all traces of tumor such that no further treatment is needed. In effect, it is a permanent state of remission. While this is technically possible for your pet, it is more constructive and realistic to focus on increasing life quality. With lymphoma, remission is likely but cure is not. Treatment may be thought of as an exchange of only a short time with your pet for a substantially longer time with your pet. It is important to keep your goals in proper perspective through this treatment: In veterinary medicine, the goal for lymphoma is a long remission, not a cure.

Category: Lymphoma in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Lymphoma is currently the most common malignancy in cats, accounting for as much as 30 percent of all feline cancers. Luckily, it is just as responsive to medication as it is in dogs, and prolonged remissions are common. This article reviews the common forms of lymphoma in cats, including diagnosis and treatment expectations. Lymphoma is a cancer made of lymphocytes, and these lymphocytes readily travel throughout the body via the lymph system. Because of all this traveling, lymphoma is only a localized problem in rare situations, so surgery and radiotherapy are not appropriate as sole treatments. To reach cancerous lymphocytes in all the places they have gone, medication (chemotherapy) is necessary because medication can be carried all over the body via circulation. Treatment of lymphoma is going to involve pills and/or injections for your cat regardless of which form of lymphoma has been diagnosed. Classification by Anatomical Location As in the dog, one of the more common ways to classify lymphoma is by the anatomical area (meaning location on the body) where the cancer is mainly located. In dogs, the most common form of lymphoma is the multicentric form, where many (if not all) of the body’s lymph nodes seem to enlarge and fill with cancer cells at the same time. Cats are certainly able to develop multicentric lymphoma as well, but by far, the most common form of lymphoma in cats is the intestinal form, so most of this discussion will center there. Other notable forms of feline lymphoma include renal (kidney) lymphoma, nasal lymphoma, and mediastinal lymphoma. Intestinal Lymphoma As mentioned earlier, lymphoma can develop anywhere there is lymph tissue and virtually all organs have some bits of scattered lymph tissue associated with them. It is not clear why some areas seem to be especially vulnerable to developing lymphoma over others. In the past, the feline leukemia virus was the chief cause of feline lymphoma development. Until there was a feline leukemia virus vaccine, the intestinal form of lymphoma was unusual. Now that Felv vaccination is common, intestinal lymphoma accounts for 50-70% of all cases of feline lymphoma. Until there was a feline leukemia virus vaccine, the intestinal form of lymphoma was unusual but now that Felv vaccination is common, intestinal lymphoma accounts for 50-70% of all cases of feline lymphoma. Cats with intestinal lymphoma tend to be seniors (ages nine to 13 years on average) with a chronic history of weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, or all three. Appetite is variable, which means it may be normal, excessive, reduced, or non-existent. Intestinal lymphoma may be a distinct mass or growth or group of growths, or appear as a more subtle infiltration of cancerous lymphocytes into the delicate membranes of the bowel lining. Infiltrative lesions, which are often invisible to the naked eye, generally respond to chemotherapy; surgery is not necessary or even helpful. Distinct masses, however, can cause an acute obstruction and may require surgical removal to relieve this potential emergency. Removing these masses does not control the cancer, and chemotherapy is still needed after the surgical site has healed. Diagnosis Confirming lymphoma requires a sample of tissue, ideally a small chunk or at least a smear of cells. There are several ways to harvest tissue for analysis. Surgical Biopsy Surgical biopsy involves opening the abdomen and removing pieces of tissue for analysis. Endoscopic Biopsy Involves the use of a long scope inserted into the mouth and/or anus to view the intestine and stomach from the inside. A small “biter” is inserted through the scope that can bite out little pinches of intestinal tissue; these biopsies are not full thickness, but the scope allows for specific areas to be sampled. Needle Aspiration Involves removing a sample of cells from a larger organ or from a mass with a needle, usually with ultrasound guidance. Ultrasound without Biopsy? Ultrasound represents a non-invasive means to evaluate the texture of the organs of the abdomen. Intestinal lymphoma tends to have a characteristic disruption of the bowel lining that is visible by ultrasound. Further, lymph node enlargement in the abdomen can be evaluated as well as texture in the liver. Lymphoma has the ability to be quite subtle in its manifestation, but if the appearance of the bowel on ultrasound is classical, it may be reasonable to begin treatment based solely on this information and forego the more expensive/invasive biopsy procedures. Learn more information oninfiltrative bowel diseaseand the pros and cons of treating it without tissue sampling. Another way that ultrasound might negate the need for further procedures is by obtaining a diagnostic aspirate. If there is a mass or if the local lymph nodes are enlarged, they may be aspirated as described above. If the cells obtained indicate lymphoma is present, then the diagnosis has been adequately obtained. Furthermore, the appearance of the intestine and lymph nodes is often ambiguous. In this situation, the liver can be aspirated despite its normal appearance. Often, lymphoma can be found hiding out there. Again, if a diagnostic aspirate is obtained via ultrasound, it is not necessary to pursue surgery or endoscopy. High-Grade VS Low-Grade One of the advantages of having an actual tissue sample is the ability to grade the malignancy of the lymphoma. Lymphoma is graded by the pathologist reading the biopsy sample as either high-grade, low-grade, or intermediate-grade. The grade refers to how rapidly the cells appear to be dividing and how malignant they appear, with a high grade being the most malignant. The grade of lymphoma bears on its response to chemotherapy (see below). It may be possible to grade a lymphoma with an aspirate sample, but it is vastly easier with an actual chunk of tumor. As a general rule, with lymphoma, higher grades tend to be more responsive to chemotherapy drugs. With feline intestinal lymphoma, however, it is the low-grade cases that achieve remission more easily and for prolonged periods of time. Treatment As with most forms of lymphoma, treatment centers on medication rather than surgery or radiation therapy. The use of medication to treat this disease is called chemotherapy, a term fraught with unpleasant connotations. It is important to realize that cats rarely experience nausea, poor appetite, or malaise with their chemotherapy, and you should not make decisions thinking the cat will be put through some kind of difficult procedure. Instead, the difficulty centers not around side effects but around giving daily medication to a cat and regularly bringing the cat to the vet’s office for injectable treatments and monitoring tests. High-grade (also called lymphoblastic) lymphoma is bad news. Only 25-50% of cats achieve remission, and those that achieve it generally sustain it for only two to nine months. Fortunately, most feline lymphoma is a low-grade (also called lymphocytic) form of lymphoma. This form behaves much more like inflammatory bowel disease, and, in fact, treatment for severe IBD is largely the same as for low-grade intestinal lymphoma. Approximately 70% of cats with this form of lymphoma will achieve remission, and the median survival time is 23-30 months. Treatment for this form of lymphoma generally involves oral medication:prednisoloneandchlorambucil. Many people opt to treat with these two medications based on ultrasound appearance of the GI tract, playing the odds that there will be a response. Given the expense of more accurate diagnostics, this may be a reasonable alternative approach. Renal Lymphoma Renal lymphoma is lymphoma in the kidneys and is one of the worst forms of lymphoma for a cat to contend with. In most cases, the cat is brought to the veterinarian for symptoms related to insufficient kidney function: poor appetite, excessive water consumption, weight loss, and possibly vomiting. Unlike the more typical cases of kidney insufficiency, where the kidneys are shrunken and small, the cat with renal lymphoma will have symmetrically large kidneys. A needle aspirate of the kidney usually reveals lymphoma cells. With chemotherapy, kidney enlargement reduces, and often, kidney function improves until remission is lost. Median survival is only 3 to 6 months, though a recent case report highlighted a cat who lived many years, so long remission times are not impossible. Approximately 50 percent of cats with renal lymphoma are also positive for thefeline leukemia virus, which carries the potential for other complicating issues. Unlike other forms of lymphoma, renal lymphoma has a strong association with tumor spread to the nervous system (brain or spinal cord). This makes for an unpleasant complication, and, unfortunately, this occurs in up to 40 percent of renal lymphoma cats. Mediastinal Lymphoma The mediastinum is not a structure with which most people are familiar. Most people know the chest cavity contains the heart, lungs and some other affiliated structures. But these organs are not just loose and flopping around in the chest, and they are not simply held in place by gravity. The mediastinum is a sheet of connective tissue that bisects the chest and contains the heart, esophagus, trachea, and other central structures similar to a vacuum-packed plastic bag. The mediastinum divides the chest into right and left halves and stabilizes the location of the organs in the middle. Of note in the lymphoma situation are the thymus gland (generally atrophied in adult animals) and the mediastinal lymph nodes. These are lymph system tissues and they become the seat of mediastinal lymphoma.  When these lymph structures fill with lymphoma, the normal fluid drainage of the chest is hampered, and fluid begins to back up in the chest, creating what is called a pleural effusion. This fluid takes up space in the chest that would normally go to expanding the lungs and when the lungs cannot expand, the patient cannot breathe. Shallow rapid breaths, possibly with the mouth open, result and the patient must focus on breathing rather than normal activities, including eating. The fluid can be tapped off the chest using a needle, and a sample can be sent to the laboratory for analysis. Usually, lymphoma cells can be found in the fluid if the cat has mediastinal lymphoma. Treatment is chemotherapy, as with the other forms of lymphoma. Most mediastinal patients are young (less than 5 years old) adults, and most (80%) are feline leukemia virus-positive. Siamese cats seem to be predisposed to this form of lymphoma. In the days before the vaccine for the feline leukemia virus, mediastinal lymphoma was the most common form of feline lymphoma. It is rarely seen today. Cats that are positive for the leukemia virus tend not to live as long because of other complications from the infection, but remission is readily obtained regardless of the viral infection in most cats. Nasal Lymphoma Although nasal lymphoma is rare, it bears mentioning because it is the only form that is potentially localized to one area. Cats with nasal lymphoma typically have nasal swelling, sneezing, and nasal discharge. Localized disease (i.e. the tumor in the nose) can be treated with radiotherapy or with chemotherapy. In general, as with other forms of lymphoma, the disease is assumed to have traveled to other (distant) areas of the body. Because distant disease is addressed with chemotherapy and it is assumed that lymphoma patients have distant disease with their local disease, most nasal lymphoma patients receive chemotherapy. Prolonged remission times (median survival times over 500 days) are possible with treatment.

Category: Myeloma-Related Disorders in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What are Myeloma-related Disorders? Myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells. Plasma cells are specialized lymphocytes, i.e. they are part of the white blood cell group and are key components of the immune system. In the healthy individual, plasma cells are responsible for making antibodies and help protect against disease. Plasma cells that become cancerous are known as myeloma cells. A broad spectrum of different clinical signs may develop as myeloma cells proliferate, making this a difficult and challenging disease to diagnose and treat. Currently reported feline myeloma-related disorders include: Otto Kahler (1849-1893), a physician from Prague, is accredited with the first medical description of myeloma in humans.  Incidentally, the word myeloma is derived from two parts: myelo from the Greek word muelos meaning marrow, and oma, a Greek suffix commonly used to denote a tumor. The first description of myeloma in cats was not used until 1957 and was published by Holzworth & Meier from the Angel Memorial Animal Hospital in Boston. Many more reports on this condition now exist, but overall the myeloma-related disorders are relatively rare tumours in cats. What Signs are seen with Myeloma-related Disorders? Symptoms can vary tremendously within the same patient over time, as well as between patients. Clinical signs are dependent upon the location(s) the myeloma cell is proliferating in, as well as signs attributable to the excess production of antibodies by these cancerous myeloma cells. Furthermore, these tumors show differing patterns of clinical signs between different animal species. Cats with myeloma commonly have anemia and this can contribute to the lethargy and weakness that may be seen. The cancerous myeloma cells typically produce immunoglobulins (monoclonal antibodies), which are often referred to as a paraprotein or M-protein. Filtration of the paraprotein by the kidneys leads to abnormal kidney function and even kidney failure. Excessive levels of paraprotein increase the “thickness” of the blood and result in hyperviscosity syndromes that may damage the eye (causing blindness), the nervous system (causing nerve or brain signs), the heart (cardiomyopathy), or in blood clotting (bleeding tendencies). The myeloma cells can congregate in clumps in various internal organs (e.g. in cats, the liver and/or spleen are commonly affected) or within skin, causing isolated tumors (or plasmacytomas), that can interfere with the normal function of these organs or the surrounding area. If the myeloma cells proliferate in the marrow - as happens in some cats, but is more common in human patients or dogs -  then destruction of bone can be seen (also known as osteolysis) causing bone pain or even fractures. Myeloma cells can also disturb the control of key body chemicals (such as calcium metabolism). Patients with myeloma can also be immunosuppressed and have a reduced ability to fight infections. Treatment and Survival in Myeloma-related Disorders Before commencing treatment, a complete diagnostic work-up is strongly recommended. The goal in treating multiple myeloma is to improve quality of life, relieve symptoms and pain if present, and to prolong survival. Complete cure has not been reported. Complete remission (meaning the alleviation of clinical signs) can be achieved. In one report, the majority of cats responded to combination chemotherapy and these cats had a median survival time of 12 months, which is not dissimilar to some reports for the treatment of standard lymphoma. Disease control is usually eventually complicated by a tendency for myeloma cells to become resistant to anti-cancer drugs. What should I do if Myeloma is Suspected in my Pet? Complete investigations for myeloma-related disorders are complex and may take several days. Ideally, referral to a veterinary oncologist in a multi-disciplinary specialist centre is in the best interests of the patient.

Category: Nasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Squamous cell carcinomas are tumors that are locally destructive and can spread aggressively in the area where they have arisen. That said, there are some circumstances where it is possible to either cure or achieve meaningful control of this tumor, and the nasal form is one of these situations. The squamous cell carcinoma is associated with sun exposure, and this means that lesions on the white-furred areas of the feline face are at risk. The ear tips and nose are particularly vulnerable, as one might expect, as these areas are not well-protected by fur. These tumors begin as a small scabby area that may not attract much attention as it can be mistaken for a minor abrasion. This minor abrasion, however, does not heal and continues to get larger. Because squamous cell carcinoma does not spread distantly in the body until late in its course, this provides a window during which it can be successfully treated. Once it gets too big, that window has closed even if the tumor has not yet spread. Surgical Treatment If the tumor is not too big, surgical removal is curative. That said, squamous cell carcinoma can spread to surrounding tissues, so a wide margin of normal tissue must be removed in order to get the whole tumor.  If the tumor has grown too large, there will not be enough tissue to get a good margin around it, and it will regrow, resuming its destructive course. The surgery is ideally done with laser equipment to reduce bleeding; it is probably best to seek the skills of a surgery specialist or at least a veterinarian with a great deal of facial surgery experience. Your veterinarian may recommend a nerve block during surgery to help control pain after the procedure. The leather of the nose is removed along with some of the surrounding haired skin. The nasal opening will heal cosmetically but will look a little unusual.Discuss with your veterinarian whether or not a referral to a specialist is in the best interest of you and your pet. Surgical Recovery Recovery can vary depending on the tumor size, location, and overall health of your cat. Your veterinary surgeon will give you post- operative instructions and can tell you what to monitor after taking your cat home, including what would be considered an emergency. Preventing self-harm is crucial, and your cat may have to wear an e-collar or “cone” to prevent pawing at their face and harming the surgical site(s). Pain medications and antibiotics are commonly prescribed. You may notice small drops of blood or nasal fluid coming from the nostrils right after bringing your cat home. They may also cough or have a “rougher” sounding voice from the tube placed during surgery which helps them to breathe while under anesthesia (endotracheal tube). Many cats don’t want to eat as much after surgery, and your veterinarian may recommend offering various foods to entice them, appetite stimulants, and surgery site cleaning under sedation (to allow them to smell their food). Any excessive bleeding, difficulty breathing, changes in sleeping habits, or other situations after surgery should be discussed with your veterinarian. Cryotherapy Cryotherapy may be less invasive. This involves using a probe to freeze the tumor. Again, this can be curative if the tumor is small enough, but in freezing the tissue, the cells are damaged and can’t be analyzed by biopsy. The biopsy (lab analysis) of the tissue can confirm squamous cell carcinoma and  enables the pathologist to tell if the excision was complete. This is valuable information that we would prefer not to forgo for obvious reasons. Side effects of cryotherapy are generally mild and include swelling, redness, and pain. For the next 3-6 months your veterinarian will monitor your cat for signs of tumor regrowth. Cats with tumors that have grown into surrounding tissues also need to be checked for cancers in other areas. This may include X-rays of your cat’s chest and lymph node exams. For cases of nasal squamous cell carcinoma caused by sun exposure, the ears and eyelid margins also must be closely monitored along with the nose for regrowth of cancerous areas. Radiation Therapy Radiotherapy is rapidly becoming the treatment of choice. Strontium plesiotherapy using strontium 90 involves applying a localized radiation source to the tumor directly for a brief period of time. (Imagine a wand with a radiation source on the end.) Radiation destroys tissue in a 3 mm diameter from the source, which allows for the destruction of small superficial tumors. As with surgery, if the tumor is too big, it cannot be cured. Alternatively, external radiation beams can be aimed at the tumor under general anesthesia. In one study, 60 percent of irradiated cats had a complete response, and 33 percent had a partial response. Radiation therapy obviously requires specialized equipment that is usually found only in specialty facilities. It is not available everywhere. A consultation with a veterinary oncologist will help determine if a given patient is a good candidate and what is involved in finding the nearest radiofacility. Imiquimod 5% Creme Imiquimod is an immunity-modifying topical crème that is palliative for tumors too large for curative removal or to treat the more superficial form of squamous cell carcinoma called Bowenoid carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Imiquimod is a relatively expensive product, and an upset stomach can result if the crème is licked (which it inevitably would be). NSAIDs You may not know the term "cyclooxygenase," but you are probably familiar with human anti-inflammatory cyclooxygenase inhibitors like aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil®), naproxen (Aleve®), and others. While these human anti-inflammatoriesare not safe for cats, there are some prescripton veterinary medications that are. This comes into play with nasal squamous cell carcinomas because there is potential for carcinomas to express enough cyclooxygenase that a feline-friendly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain reliever (such aspiroxicam,meloxicam, orrobenacoxib) may have anti-tumor effects. These medications are not completely without issues but may be helpful when other treatments are not an option, especially since they offer some pain relief. Prognosis (Outlook) Nasal squamous cell carcinomas usually do spread to tissues close by, but are slow to move to other areas in the body. Cats with superficial tumors (those that have not spread to deeper tissues in the nose or face) have better outlooks vs. large and deeply penetrating tumors. Even though squamous cell carcinomas do not spread until relatively late in their course, they can still be extremely difficult to address. The nasal version is an exception to the poor prognosis rule as long as it is detected early and removed or treated with radiation promptly. The potential for a full recovery depends on the size and location of the tumor, treatment procedures, and your cat’s overall health. Discuss your questions with your veterinarian. Also, talk about what you and your cat might experience. This will help you prepare for managing this condition as effectively as possible.

Category: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Squamous cell carcinoma is not only the most common oral malignancy in cats, it has one of the poorest outcomes. In most cases, the goal is to minimize infection and pain until the tumor has advanced to a state where comfortable eating and/or breathing is not possible. The tumor is treatable only if detected early in its course. Prevention and Risk Factors While sun exposure is an important risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma on the ears and nose, the owner's cigarette smoking habits turn out to be one of the most important risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma. The risk goes up four times when the owner smokes 1 to 19 cigarettes daily. Cats who have at one time lived with a smoker have an increased risk over cats that have always lived in non-smoking homes. The use of flea collars was associated with a five-fold increase in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma, although the study that found this correlation was not able to differentiate between different types of flea collars. Interestingly, regular flea shampoo use was associated with a 90% reduction in risk (perhaps a surface toxin is washed away by frequent bathing). Regular feeding of canned food, especially tuna fish, was associated with increased risk for the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma. In humans, poor oral hygiene has been associated with an increased risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma, so it is speculated to be the basis of the canned food correlation in cats as well. The average age at diagnosis is 12.5 years. This tumor usually occurs in older cats.Get comfortable looking in your cat's mouth. Where to Look The squamous cell carcinoma often grows from the gums surrounding the teeth or under the tongue. To look under a cat's tongue, press your thumb upward from under the chin (in the soft area between the lower jaw bones). This will raise the base of the tongue upward; when the cat's mouth is open, it's easy to see the root of the tongue. Become familiar with the symmetry and contour of your cat's jaws, both upper and lower. Regular teeth cleaning is important for all pets.In pets, regular dental care at the vet's office may mean early tumor detection. Testing Benign lesions can look similar to malignant lesions to the naked eye, and possibly even on radiographs, so a biopsy needed is for the correct diagnosis. In most cases, some kind of sedation and dental evaluation is needed to get close enough to the area in question. If a small sample of tissue can be harvested, the diagnosis should be revealed. Sometimes suspicious tissues are aspirated with needles to harvest cells for diagnostic purposes. It is particularly helpful to aspirate an enlarged lymph node or swelling to see if there is a tumor. Aspiration is not as accurate as biopsy but is less invasive and may not require anesthesia depending on the location of the suspected tumor. Fine needle aspiration is a test your veterinarian may recommend. The squamous cell carcinoma is a destructive tumor. Underlying bone is commonly eaten away. Findings of bone destruction on a radiograph may also be helpful in establishing diagnosis.Computed tomography (CT or CAT scan) is needed to determine the extent of the tumor. If surgery is considered, knowing the tumor margins is crucial and radiographs simply cannot accurately show how far the tumor extends. Treatment Sadly, options are limited for treating oral squamous cell carcinoma; fewer than 10% of cats survive one year from the time of diagnosis. Cats are euthanized when they become too disfigured to eat or breathe. Still, the situation is not without options and some situations are more favorable than others. Your primary veterinarian or veterinary oncologist will recommend treatment options specifically for your pet’s condition. Surgery (Mandibulectomy) When it comes to oral squamous cell carcinoma, the best-case scenario is a tumor in the front of the lower jaw, because this area can be surgically removed. If the tumor is located on the lower jaw, it may be possible to remove the part of the lower jaw that contains the tumor. This surgery is called mandibulectomy and is preceded by a CT scan (where available) to determine the margins of the tumor. If the tumor is located in the upper jaw, surgery is probably not an option (see below). Mandibulectomy Combined with RadiotherapyThe longest survival times (14 months) have been yielded by a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. The study reporting this rather long survival time only reviewed seven affected cats, a relatively small number upon which to draw generalizations. These cats, however, all required feeding tubes for a median of 15 days and had drooling issues and required regular cleaning (usually daily) on the chest and feet long term. Radiotherapy with or without ChemotherapyRadiotherapy can be definitive (intended to cure) or palliative (intended to slow disease and improve life quality but not cure). If surgery can reduce the tumor size to what is called microscopic disease, meaning no tumor is visible to the naked eye, radiation after healing provides the longest survival times. If the tumor is too large to remove to this state, definitive radiation is not going to be possible, but palliative radiation is still an option if it is aggressively done (twice daily treatments for 9-10 days). In this situation, median survivals of 5-6 months were obtained. Similarly, another study showed promising results: a group of 11 cats with oral squamous cell carcinoma treated with a combination of radiation and the chemotherapy agent mitoxantrone yielded complete remission in 8 cats with a median duration of 170 days. It should be noted radiotherapy is generally a very expensive treatment and, when the mouth is involved, can create enough inflammation that a feeding tube is necessary to support the patient. Chemotherapy alone has shown such poor efficacy that it is not worth the attempt for this tumor. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) It has recently been found that certain tumors, particularly carcinomas, have receptors to bind the enzyme cyclooxygenase (lovingly known as COX). This enzyme is involved in the production of biochemicals called prostaglandins that are involved in the generation of inflammation. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as piroxicam and even meloxicam, two drugs more commonly used against arthritis pain, may have anti-cancer properties beyond simply controlling inflammation and pain associated with tumors. Often, these drugs are prescribed for cats with oral squamous cell carcinoma but be aware that cats can be sensitive to their side effects. Often, treatment of the tumor justifies this risk but still, you should be aware of potential complications and discuss the timing of monitoring blood tests with your veterinarian. The bottom line is that the oral squamous cell carcinoma is a very bad tumor for a cat, and as yet, research has not yielded a reliably good therapy. Because the tumor does not spread until late in its course, removing the tumor when it is small is the best hope for a worthwhile survival time. The lower jaw tumors are best suited to this kind of therapy; other forms, such as tumors under the tongue or in the upper jaw, are nearly impossible to address meaningfully, though aggressive radiotherapy is emerging as an option. It is important to keep a realistic attitude about what to expect. Information in this article was largely obtained from the following review article: Marretta, J.J., Garrett, L.D., Marretta, S.M.Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma: an overview.Veterinary Medicine,June 2007; p392-406. Other Types of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma As mentioned, it is difficult to achieve meaningful treatment for a squamous cell carcinoma in the upper jaw and less than 10% of patients are still alive one year after diagnosis. In fact, most cats have stopped eating and require euthanasia within one month or so. Even with palliative radiotherapy only 1 to 4 months of survival are reported. That said, a new therapy is emerging in the form of aggressive radiotherapy. This protocol involves twice daily radiation of the tumor area for 7 days. With this protocol, after therapy 56% of feline patients had no discernible tumor for an average of 13 months. A feeding tube is placed during the time of therapy and kept throughout the recovery time until the cat is eating well and the radiation site is healed. This kind of therapy is relatively expensive but for a 50:50 shot at a long remission it may well be worthwhile.

Category: Cardiomyopathy in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(HCM) is the most common heart disease in cats today. Cardiomyopathy means heart (cardio) muscle (myo) disease (pathy). Other cardiomyopathies in cats that you may hear your veterinarian discuss are: Dilated Cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) used to be a much more common disease in cats than it is today. In the late 1980s, it was discovered that insufficient taurine in feline diets was the cause of most cases of dilated cardiomyopathy. Taurine is an amino acid that cats cannot produce, but must obtain by eating meat. It is essential that the food you feed your cat contains adequate amounts of taurine. This is one reason why home-cooking for cats is risky.  Once the cause of DCM was identified, all commercial diets were supplemented with taurine to prevent this disease from developing. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle weakens and the heart becomes large and contracts weakly.  Eventually, there is a buildup of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and the chest cavity (pleural effusion), a situation that is referred to as congestive heart failure. As with HCM, diagnosis requires an echocardiogram. The cat’s taurine concentration can be measured with a blood test. To be valid,taurine must be assessed prior to beginning taurine supplementation.Because taurine is also essential for vision, your veterinarian might also look in your cat’s eyes to look for other signs of taurine deficiency, such as central retinal degeneration. If taurine deficiency is the cause of cardiomyopathy, most cats who survive for more than 7 days after beginning taurine supplementation will recover and most will ultimately need no ongoing therapy when the heart muscle returns to normal. This usually takes 4 to 6 months. During the initial treatment period, and for long as it takes for the heart muscle to recover, congestive heart failure must be aggressively managed and the risk of clots to the limbs and other organs (as well as sudden death) are always a concern as discussed in the section onHCM. Unfortunately, most cases of DCM today are not related to taurine deficiency.  In such cases, treatment is aimed at managing congestive heart failure when it develops.  Your veterinarian will be able to choose the most appropriate drugs and therapies for managing congestive heart failure. Restrictive Cardiomyopathy And Unclassified Cardiomyopathy These less well understood forms of cardiomyopathy also require diagnosis by echocardiography. There are no specific known causes or treatments. Affected cats are also at risk of congestive heart failure, sudden death, and clots to the limbs and other organs.

Category: Feline Aortic Thromboembolism (FATE or Saddle Thrombus)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called saddle thrombus) One tends to feel apprehensive about a condition with the acronym FATE, and rightly so. FATE (feline aortic thromboembolism) is a dramatic and painful condition with serious implications. It comes on suddenly and appears to paralyze the cat, causing one or both rear legs to become useless and even noticeably cold. The cat will hyperventilate and cry out with extreme pain. Despite the extreme presentation, the cat may be able to recover from the episode, but it is important to understand how this came to be in order to make decisions. A thrombus is a large blood clot. An embolism is a small blood clot lodged in an unfortunate location. What is a Saddle Thrombus? A saddle thrombus is a blood clot that breaks off from a larger blood clot in the heart, travels down the aorta, and lodges at the saddle. Not only is the blood supply to one or both rear legs cut off but a metabolic cascade results, leading to the release of assorted inflammatory mediators (especially serotonin). The muscles of the rear legs become hard, the foot pads become bluish in color, and the condition is extremely painful. The inflammatory mediators readily lead to circulatory shock. The aorta is the largest artery in the body. It stems from the heart where it arches up and runs down the length of the back, ultimately splitting into the arteries supplying blood to the back legs. The split where the aorta becomes the left and right iliac arteries is called the saddle. 72 percent of cats with a saddle thrombus have both rear legs affected. Where the Saddle Thrombus Came from The saddle thrombus comes from a larger clot in the left atrium of the heart. This obviously begs the question as to why there would be a large blood clot in a cat’s heart. In fact, 89 percent of cats with a saddle thrombus have heart disease. Heart disease leads to turbulent blood flow, which encourages the formation of clots. Not every cat with heart disease will form an abnormal clot, in fact, most will not; but there is presently no clear way to predict which cats will form these clots and which ones will not. That said, there are some suggestive echo findings that are felt to predict increased risk. In cats withhypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the most common form of feline heart disease, the size of the left atrium is one factor that is considered. The presence of “smoke” in the atrium during echocardiography is another factor. (“Smoke” is the whispy material seen in the circulating blood.) Both these factors are considered controversial but when they are seen, most cardiologists will recommend some kind of therapy to reduce clotting tendency (i.e., a blood thinner). The problem is that, in order to go on preventive therapy, there has to have been a reason to see a cardiologist in the first place (heart murmur during a physical exam, heart enlargement incidentally found on a radiograph, abnormal blood test, or actual symptoms of heart disease).  The majority of cats with aortic thromboembolism have had none of these things, and the saddle thrombus is the very first symptom of a problem. In 76% of cats with saddle thrombus, the FATE episode was the first sign of heart disease. How Bad is this Situation? The outcome is variable but has the potential to be very bad. Let's review the possibilities. Best Case Scenario (Saddle Thrombus But No Concurrent Heart Failure)Cats almost never have a FATE episode unless there is an underlying heart disease, so it is not unusual for the cat in question to also have heart failure; in fact, about half of them do. This, of course, means that about half of them don't. If there is only the thrombus and its associated pain to deal with, this makes the job simpler as the goal becomes pain control until the thrombus can dissolve and circulation can be restored. That said, having a thrombus cutting off circulation to the legs can involve some very serious tissue damage and can be life-threatening in and of itself. A lot of toxic biochemicals are generated in the damaged tissue, and when the clot dissolves, these are all released into the rest of the circulation and this event can be lethal even without heart failure. The clot damage can be severe, symmetrical, and disastrous, or it can create only a partial circulatory blockage, and some improvement in function may be evident in a couple of days. Recovery of function can be complete or partial, and it may take several weeks to tell. Basically, for the cat with a thrombus and no heart failure, the take-home points are: Saddle Thrombus With Concurrent Heart FailureIn this scenario, the cat not only has the pain and paralysis of the saddle thrombus but is also in active heart failure. Even if the thrombus situation resolves relatively promptly with initial signs of limb function recovery and acceptable pain control after a couple of days, there is still a life-threatening cardiac crisis to contend with. The heart failure alone may be lethal in the short term, but let's assume the heart failure can be controlled quickly with medication AND the recovery from the thrombus is in progress. The cat will need heart medication, blood thinners, and nursing care while the rear legs recover. The median survival of saddle thrombus cats with heart failure is 77 days, while the median survival of saddle thrombus cats without heart failure is 223 days. Tissue Damage from ThrombusThe good news is that permanent limb damage is the exception and not the rule, but it is possible. Some cats will lose skin or even muscle from the circulatory compromise. About 5% of cats will have tissue damage appearing as an open wound. As circulation returns, this sort of injury should heal. Another 5 percent will have more serious damage, and the occasional cat will require amputation of a limb. Rapid Death from the Tissue Damage or Heart FailureMany cats will die in the hospital. Some are simply overcome by heart failure. Some will throw another blood clot or multiple clots to a less survivable location, such as the brain or lung blood vessels. Some will suffer what is called a reperfusion injury when, as circulation returns to the limbs, toxic biochemicals from the limbs enter the main body of the circulation. Large amounts of potassium released from dying cells can be enough to fibrillate the already diseased heart. A saddle thrombus is a serious event. Is it likely to be lethal? It turns out the best predictive parameter is the body temperature at the time of presentation to the hospital. Cats with an initial body temperature over 98.9⁰F have a greater than 50 percent chance of avoiding this disaster and getting well enough to return home. EuthanasiaBecause of the potential for repeat saddle thrombus episodes, the need for regular medication administration at home, and the potential long-term treatment of heart disease, not to mention the seriousness & painfulness of the cat’s initial predicament, approximately 50-75% of pet owners elect euthanasia without attempting treatment. Some Statistics What to Expect at the Hospital The doctor will need to quickly determine if the cat has a saddle thrombus or some other reason for rear limb paralysis and pain. The saddle thrombus patient will have cold rear feet, with a bluish or purplish color of the pads when compared to the front feet. Sometimes a toenail will be clipped short on a rear toe to check for bleeding. The diagnosis is often clinched by comparing a blood glucose level taken from the front of the body against one taken from the rear legs. Pain control is generally initiated while these preliminary evaluations are being performed. Obviously, the initial body temperature is recorded so as to assist in making a prognosis and assessing the severity of the situation. Once the cat is more comfortable, more comprehensive blood testing can be performed and chest radiographs can be taken. In doing this, the cat is assessed for kidney toxins, toxins related to poor circulation, general biochemical body function, stress, heart failure, and possible lung cancer. If heart failure is present, diuretics will be needed to relieve extra fluid from the circulation and ease the burden on the weakened heart. There is controversy about using injectable blood thinners, but many hospitals will begin them and later transition to oralclopidogrel,aspirinor both. Most cats will present to their regular veterinarian's office for initial care. The question will arise as to whether 24-hour care is needed or likely to be worth the extra expense, stress of travel to a specialty center, etc. The benefit of the specialty center includes the ability to continue pain-relieving medications overnight and to watch for and address sudden exacerbations with regard to heart failure or new embolisms. The cat will also need an assessment by a veterinary cardiologist to assess the underlying heart disease and prescribe medications as indicated. Many specialty centers will have a cardiologist on-site so this is another reason to transfer sooner rather than later. Of course, not every community has a specialty center conveniently located so the echocardiogram may need to be addressed by a mobile specialist, by telemedicine (over the internet), or even by a skilled non-specialist. The cat will need to be hospitalized for at least a couple of days and possibly for as long as a week for pain management and to establish comfort and appetite before release from the hospital. Owners will need to be able to give medication and nursing care as needed. Saddle Thrombus in the Absence of Heart Disease We have discussed saddle thrombus in terms of heart disease so far but it turns out there are other ways to get an aortic thromboembolism. While 89 percent of cats have heart disease, 6 percent will have cancer, and 3 percent will have no apparent reason for their thrombus. The cats with cancer usually have lung cancer, which is discovered when chest radiographs are taken to assess heart disease. Lung cancer is not the only type of tumor that can induce a state promoting inappropriate clotting, though, so if heart disease is not found, a tumor search should be initiated with abdominal ultrasound. In this scenario, obviously the cat must contend with the thrombus recovery and medication to prevent future embolism, PLUS the newly discovered cancer and whatever treatments are available to address that.

Category: Heartworm Infection in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Do Cats Get Heartworm? The answer to this question is an unequivocal yes, but feline heartworm disease is a lung disease rather than a heart disease as it is in dogs. The parasite is the same but because the heartworm's natural host is not a cat, the interaction between worm and host creates a very different condition. It isn't good for either the cat nor is it good for the worm. When Heartworm Meets Cat: The Biology The story begins with a mosquito, just as in the canine situation. The mosquito feeds on a heartworm-infected dog, the heartworm microfilaria (the youngest larvae) are sipped up into the mosquito during feeding, and develop in the mosquito's body for the next couple of weeks. This is all according to the plan for the heartworm's life cycle until the mosquito bites a cat instead of another dog. In the third stage, larval heartworms enter the cat's body and develop in the tissues. The feline body is an inhospitable host and worm development is fraught with immunological attack. By the time the larva has reached its 5th stage, it is on its way to the pulmonary arteries to complete its maturation but most infections will end here as the feline immune system is nearly relentless in its assault. At best, only about 25% of the original infecting larvae will survive to adulthood, which means most infections are aborted in this last stage of larval development. Most cats with adult heartworms only have a few worms (1-3 on average) and development to the adult stage takes an extra couple of months in the feline body compared to the canine body. Chances are that there will be a single sex worm population rendering worm reproduction impossible. Only about 20% of feline infections produce microfilaria (youngest worm larvae); further, the feline immune system is so aggressive that the larvae only live a matter of weeks whereas they can live for up to 2 years in a dog. When the adult/parent worm dies inside the cat, a huge amount of inflammation is generated, and many cats do not survive this stage. If the cat does survive, there is likely long-term damage to the lung tissue. It is unclear what percentage of an area's feline population will be infected. The standard statistic is that a region's feline incidence will be approximately 10% of the canine incidence but this appears to be a low estimation since feline infection cannot be defined by the presence of adult worms. It turns out that heartworm disease in cats is not really comparable to the canine disease. In dogs, the disease is vascular (adult heartworms cause trouble by plugging up the pulmonary arteries and generating inflammation there). Adult heartworms make it to the dog's pulmonary arteries after a long maturation process that starts with a tiny larva being deposited adjacent to a mosquito bite in a tiny droplet of mosquito saliva. The baby heartworms do not cause much trouble in dogs and it is not until they have reached substantial size and final location that they are problems. In cats, heartworm disease is more frequently a lung disease and not a vascular disease at all. It is the baby worms that cause all the trouble in feline heartworm disease. If we consider that most feline heartworm disease is from immature worms, the 10% statistic becomes substantially higher. Heartworm disease in cats can produce an assortment of clinical pictures: How many cats are infected without symptoms? The answer is not clear because it is the symptomatic cats that get the most medical scrutiny. Heartworm-Associated Respiratory Disease, or “HARD” Also known as Pulmonary Larval Dirofilariasis As stated, cats are not a natural host for the heartworm, which means the migrating larval heartworms are not likely to complete their life cycle. To recap from above, baby heartworms called microfilaria are sucked up by the mosquito feeding on an infected dog. The ingested young heartworms must spend enough time (several weeks) in themosquito'sbody to develop into an infective stage, at which point they are ready to infect a new host. The infective stage heartworm larva is deposited in a drop of mosquito spit adjacent to a mosquito bite, the larvae crawl into the skin puncture made by the mosquito, gain access to their new host, and continue to develop in the soft tissues of the new host, eventually making their way into the circulation and to the host's pulmonary arteries. The migrating young worm uses molecular signposts to tell it how to get to its host’s pulmonary arteries where it wants to finish growing up, mate, and live out its life. The worm is prepared to read CANINE signposts and does not always migrate correctly trying to understand feline protein signals. The worm may get lost and end up who knows where in the body.If the young worms get to the pulmonary arteries at all, most of them are killed by the especially reactive feline immune response against them. It is this immune reaction that causes heartworm disease in cats and it can start as soon as 75-90 days after the infecting mosquito bite. When young heartworms die in the pulmonary arteries, the immune system breaks them into fragments and attempts to remove them. The resulting inflammation leads to lung disease which manifests as coughing, respiratory effort, and vomiting.The inflammation associated with the death of fifth-stage heartworm larvae is vastly compounded should a coexisting adult heartworm die. In this situation, yet more inflammation results, and even if the cat survives, all this inflammation creates permanent damage in the delicate lung tissues. HARD mimicsfeline asthmaand the two diseases look identical on radiographs. Cats with HARD will cough, wheeze (a musical respiratory sign similar to a sigh), and vomit (though it may be hard to tell aggressive productive coughing from vomiting). Breathing may be shallow and rapid and may progress to actual respiratory distress. Heartworm testing is the only way to distinguish these conditions. Vascular Disease is Separate from HARD While in most situations feline heartworm disease is a lung disease and not a vascular disease as it is in dogs, sometimes cats do get adult worms in their pulmonary arteries just as dogs do. These adult worms do not live as long as they do in the canine body and they do not achieve the same length/size. If they find a mate and give birth to microfilariae, the microfilariae are promptly killed by the feline immune system within the first month. In short, in the feline pulmonary artery, heartworms are much smaller. You would think this would make for milder vascular disease, but because cats are so small even one adult worm takes up a great deal of space in the vasculature. The more usual lung disease is all the worse if the reaction against the immature worms is complicated by a surviving adult worm in the vasculature. When this parasite finally dies, the subsequent blood clots and inflammation is frequently fatal to cats. Most heartworm disease in cats is caused by the inflammatory reaction generated by the worm. In dogs, heartworm disease is mostly about the obstruction of blood flow from the physical size of the worms. Symptoms of Disease The cat's immune system is extremely reactive against heartworms. For this reason, it is virtually impossible to detect microfilariae in an infected cat (their immune system removes them too quickly). Also, symptoms of infection tend to be more immune-related than heart failure-related. Cats develop more of a lung disease, complete with respiratory distress, and chronic coughing or vomiting. Feline heartworm disease is often misdiagnosed as feline asthma. Sudden death may occur just as it may occur in infected dogs. In cats, there are two phases where the disease can exert symptoms. The first is when immature worms reach the lung and pulmonary arteries, as early as 75 to 90 days after infection. Even small worms are inflammatory and disruptive to circulation. Cells of inflammation infiltrate the lung and interfere with the cat’s ability to breathe. The second phase where problems can occur is when the worm dies. Since cats are not the natural host for this parasite, most immature worms that make it to the lung are killed. The presence of the dead worm is extremely inflammatory. (Imagine your body trying to remove or digest the dead body of another animal inside your lung and circulation!) The effects of this kind of widespread inflammation may reach far beyond the lung and circulatory system. The kidney can be affected as well as the gastrointestinal tract and even the nervous system. Heartworm disease is primarily a lung disease in cats, not a heart disease. Diagnostic Testing Antigen TestingIn dogs, diagnosis is usually not complicated. A blood sample is tested for proteins that can only be found on the skin of the adult female heartworm. Most infected dogs have a population of worms in their arteries, so if even one female worm is present an antigen test will show positive. In cats, disease is caused by immature worms, not adult worms female or otherwise, so this kind of testing has limited applications. There may be only a couple of male worms or no adult worms at all to generate a positive antigen test, yet the cat is infected. Microfilaria TestingIn dogs, testing for microfilariae (offspring of adult heartworms born in the host’s body) are also commonly performed. Unfortunately, in cats, microfilaria testing is virtually worthless. First, infected cats usually do not have enough adult worms for the production of offspring. There may be only a few adult worms; single-sex infection is common. Further, microfilariae, if any, are simply cleared too quickly by the host's immune system and are rarely detected. As mentioned, in cats heartworm disease stems at least in part from migrating immature larvae. No adult worms (and thus no off-spring) are necessary for disease so microfilariae testing is not worthwhile in cats. Antibody TestingAntibody testing may be more sensitive but is not adequate alone. A negative antibody test is good evidence that the cat is not infected; however, a positive antibody test may indicate several things. It could indicate a mature infection with one or more adult worms, immature worms in the body, or a past infection. (Antibody levels will remain somewhat elevated after the heartworms have long since died.) So if no single test is reliable, what are we supposed to do for testing? First of all, unlike dogs where annual screening is the norm, healthy cat screening is probably not necessary. Instead, testing is best done if a cat is sick and heartworm disease is suspected. There is still some controversy about what testing should be accomplished in a symptomatic cat. Both antibody and antigen tests in combination are recommended by some experts, while others feel the antibody test alone is probably adequate. Of course, a cat with respiratory disease probably should have chest radiographs and cardiac echocardiography to further define the condition at hand. Treatment Since the major signs of disease in the cat are due to inflammation and immune stimulation, a medication such asprednisolonecan be used to control symptoms. A bacteria calledWolbachiacommonly live within the heartworm and enhances its ability to generate inflammation. A course of doxycycline is often recommended to address these bacteria. The doxycycline course is short but the prednisolone will most likely be a several-week course that may be repeated. If the cat does not appear sick, the American Heartworm Society recommends attempting to wait out the adult worm's 2-3 year lifespan and simply monitor chest radiographs every 6 months or so. The median survival time is 1.5 years for heartworm infection in cats. Radiographs are monitored to check progress. One might wonder why we cannot use the same treatment as we do for dogs to kill any adult heartworms a cat might have. Actually, the same heartworm adulticide therapy used in dogs is best not used in cats as it is extremely dangerous to do so and is considered a last resort. There may not be a choice, however, depending on the degree of illness from the heartworm disease. Approximately one-third of cats receiving heartworm adulticide therapy will experience life-threatening embolic complications when the worms die suddenly (generally an unacceptable statistic). One month of cage confinement is typically recommended to control circulatory effort after adulticide treatment and adulticide therapy should be considered the last resort for an infected cat where symptoms of the disease cannot be controlled with prednisone. Prevention In studies of infected cats, 25% of infected cats were consideredindoor-only cats.Because of this and the disastrous effect of even one heartworm to a cat, the American Heartworm Society recommends monthly prevention forall catsliving in heartworm-endemic areas. Read theirfeline guidelines. The good news is that feline heartworm infection is preventable and there are currently four medications on the market that are reliably effective. Ivermectin The dose of ivermectin (the active ingredient of Heartgard) needed to prevent heartworm infection in cats is about four times higher than in dogs. Heartgard was the first FDA-approved heartworm prevention medication available for cats. It is a monthly flavored chewable available by prescription. Milbemycin Oxime Interceptor® also makes a monthly chewable for cats with the same active ingredient (milbemycin oxime) as Interceptor for dogs. Interceptor for cats also protects againsthookwormsandroundworms. Milbemax is similar but addspraziquantelfor regulartapewormremoval. Selamectin Revolution® entered the anti-parasite scene in 1999. This product covers fleas, roundworms, hookworms, and ear mites in addition to preventing heartworm in cats. Revolution Plus is a more recent update with enhanced flea and tick control. Either form of Revolution is an effective heartworm preventive. These products are applied topically rather than orally. Moxidectin Advantage Multi® combines imidacloprid for flea control and moxidectin for heartworm prevention in one product. This product is also applied topically. It covers roundworms, hookworms, andear mitesas well as heartworm.  Similarly, Bravecto Plus® combines fluralaner for fleas and ticks with moxidectin for worm prevention. This product also covers the same parasites as Advantage Multi plus ticks. For more information, see theAmerican Heartworm Society.

Category: High Blood Pressure in Our Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources High blood pressure is an extremely important concern in human medicine. A high stress lifestyle, smoking, and high salt diet all contribute to this potentially dangerous condition and virtually everyone in the U.S. knows how serious it can be. But what about our pets? They don’t smoke or worry about the mortgage and they don’t deposit cholesterol in their blood vessels. They do, however, get high blood pressure, especially in old age. Here is what you should probably know. What does High Blood Pressure Do? Problems from high blood pressure arise when a blood vessel is simply too small for the high pressure flow going through it. Imagine attaching a garden hose to a fire hydrant. The pressure would cause the garden hose to explode and that is what happens to a blood vessel too small for the pressure going through it. Instead of water going everywhere, as in the garden hose analogy, bleeding results. Since the affected vessels are small, the bleeding may not be noticeable but a lot of little bleeds and a lot of blood vessel destruction can create big problems over time. The retina of the eye is especially at risk, with either sudden or gradual blindness often being the first sign of latent high blood pressure. The kidney also is a target as it relies on tiny vessels to filter toxins from the bloodstream. Kidney disease is an important cause of high blood pressure and also progresses far more rapidly with it. High blood pressure also increases the risk of “embolism:” the formation of tiny blood clots that form when blood flow is abnormal. These clots can lodge in an assortment of inopportune locations including thebrain. The heart itself can fall victim to high blood pressure damage as its own tissue can be damaged, leading to scarring and thus inflexibility of the heart muscle. This is especially a problem in cats. What Causes High Blood Pressure in Pets? There are numerous diseases in pets that are associated with high blood pressure: In humans, high blood pressure is usually considered primary, meaning there is no underlying disease causing it. In animals, primary hypertension is unusual; there is almost always another disease causing it and if routine screening does not identify the problem, more tests may be in order. How is High Blood Pressure Identified? In human medicine, high blood pressure is called the silent killer because most people have no reason to think they might be hypertensive. To find high blood pressure in people, we screen for it. This means that virtually any time you see a doctor of any kind, a nurse will take your blood pressure. Similarly, in pets, a great deal of high blood pressure is identified by screening. If a pet has one of the above conditions, blood pressure is generally checked. It has recently been recommended that older pets have their blood pressure checked whenever they have a physical examination. There is some disagreement among experts as to which patients should be screened. Because of inherent insensitivity of the equipment commonly used in veterinary practice, not every pet necessarily needs to be screened. Certainly, any pet with a predisposing condition such as one of those listed above should be screened. Ask your veterinarian if your senior pet should get a blood pressure measurement. The other time high blood pressure is discovered is when it makes its presence known. This usually means some degree of blindness or some other obvious eye problem. The retina of a hypertensive patient develops tortuous-looking retinal blood vessels. Some vessels may even have broken, showing smudges of blood on the retinal surface. Some areas of the retina simply detach. Sometimes the entire retina detaches. With early identification, some vision may be restored. Do not let minor vision changes go unreported. Let your veterinarian know if you think your pet’s vision is not normal. Retinal changes can be complicated to interpret. Do not be surprised or alarmed if your veterinarian recommends referral to aveterinary ophthalmologist. A sudden neurologic condition could indicate a stroke or vascular accident in the brain or spinal cord. It used to be taken for granted that dogs and cats did not throw blood clots and get strokes like human beings can but the advent of MRI technology has shown otherwise. A sudden neurologic deficit, especially a non-painful one, is another possible indication to screen blood pressure. Also, we can't forget that the heart and kidneys are target organs of disease when it comes to hypertension. Cats found to have heart disease are typically screened for hypertension and, of course, patients with chronic kidney disease are routinely checked for hypertension as it is part of how their disease is staged. How do we Measure Blood Pressure in Pets? When a person's blood pressure is checked, the nurse uses a stethoscope to listen for "Korotkoff sounds" arise and dissipate as an inflatable cuff slowly releases over an artery. In animals, the stethoscope is just not sensitive enough and an ultrasonic probe must be taped or held over the artery. Using ultrasound, the sound of the systolic pressure is converted into an audible signal. It is not possible to measure diastolic pressure in a pet without actually placing a catheter inside an artery so we make do with just a systolic measurement. In pets, this measurement should not exceed 160. A reading of 180 is considered by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine to indicate high risk for organ damage while readings of 150-159 are considered mildly elevated. Blood pressure measurement is performed similarly to the way it is in humans. An inflatable cuff is fit snuggly around the foot, foreleg, or even tail of the pet. The cuff is inflated so as to occlude blood flow through the superficial artery. As the cuff deflates, the sound of the pulse can be heard at the point where the systolic pressure is strong enough to pump past the cuff.  Diastolic pressure is not measured. Some pets (obviously) are nervous at the vet’s office and this factor must be taken into account when reading blood pressure. It is possible for a pet to have high blood pressure at the vet’s office and normal pressure at all other times. You might think this would be a common situation but most pets are able to maintain normal blood pressure despite being surrounded by hospital staff. To account for the “White Coat Effect,” at least five measurements are taken so that the pet becomes accustomed to the process and understands that no pain is involved. What Treatment is Available for Hypertension? Ocular disease may require prescription eye drops depending on how much bleeding is in the eye and whether or not return of vision is likely. When hypertension is identified, a search for the underlying cause is indicated. It may be that controlling the underlying disease totally reverses the hypertension (especially true for hyperthyroid cats). Beyond these methods, as with people, medication to lower blood pressure is often in order. This typically involves some type of pill that dilates peripheral blood vessels, effectively making them larger so as to accommodate the high pressure blood flow going through them. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that dilates the systemic arterioles. It is the most effective drug for treating feline hypertension, with the fewest side-effects. The drug is also effective in dogs, but literature documentation is lacking. Amlodipine in dogs has always been expensive, but recently a generic version of the drug has become available, which should make it more cost effective. Amlodipinecan also be applied transdermally, although the clinical effect may be less than with orally administered amlodipine. Angiotensin II Receptor blockers (or ARB's) are a class of hypotensive agent, withtelmisartan, probably being the most common ARB used in veterinary practice. Angiotensin II is a natural biochemical created by the body in response to a drop in blood pressure and its effect is to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure strongly. Obviously this is not a biochemical a hypertensive patient needs so it should not be surprising that blocking its activity helps treat hypertension. Sometimes a combination of medications is needed before high blood pressure can be controlled. Hydralazine is a very effective antihypertensive agent in dogs, but can be associated with side effects such as reflex tachycardia and gastroinstestinal upset. Prazosinhas also been used as a vasodilator. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) do not appear to be very effective in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive dogs or cats. Beta blockers and diuretics are similarly unimpressive in reducing blood pressure in these species as sole agents. However, beta blockers may be used as adjunctive agents when reflex tachycardia occurs following the use of a vasodilator or if a patient is not responding well to a vasodilator. Salt restriction in the diet is controversial; it seems to make sense but there is not enough data at present to whole-heartedly recommend it. Certainly, if there is kidney disease present the recommendation is less equivocal as these low salt diets are designed with other features more specifically for kidney disease. This generally means a dry or canned formula prescription diet if the pet will eat it or a diet limited to dry food if the pet will not accept prescription food. Appropriate home cooked diets may be designed by a veterinary nutritionist or through the public site atwww.balanceit.com. Several places provide such services through veterinary teaching hospitals or private endeavors. After hypertension is controlled, patients should be rechecked every two to four months to keep their blood pressure in a healthy range. Research on this Topic Effect of Control of Systolic Blood Pressure of Survival in Cats with Systemic Hypertension. Jepson, R.E., Elliott, J., Brodbelt, D., Syme H.M. Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine 2007; 21: 402-409. In this study 141 pet cats with high blood pressure were studied. In these cats, 87% were found to have either evidence of renal failure (increased BUN or creatinine tests) or hyperthyroidism or both. Amlodipine besylate was used to treat hypertension in these cats and in 50% of the cats, the initial dose eventually proved inadequate and an increase was necessary. Blood pressure was stabilized within one to two recheck visits for 96% of cats, with a median time of 20 days required to achieve blood pressure stabilization. Blood pressure was more difficult to control in the long term for cats with higher urinary protein loss.

Category: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)? HCM is a disease of the heart muscle that results, in most cases, in an abnormal thickening of the muscle walls (Figure 1).  This results in altered contraction and relaxation of the heart as it pumps blood, which can lead to clinical problems.  Additionally, at least in people, the disease can also result in arrhythmias and sudden death, although this appears to be less common in cats. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is rare in dogs, although some breeds appear to be possibly over-represented. It is important to rule out other causes of thickening (hypertrophy) of the heart muscle, such as chronic hypertension, hyperthyroidism and outflow obstructions. What Causes HCM? HCM in humans is most commonly caused by mutations in genes that code for muscle proteins involved in contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle cells.  In cats, several mutations have been identified that appear to be responsible for the disease in particular breeds.  In other instances, however, no mutation has been found, but a genetic basis is suspected because the disease appears to be associated with particular breeds and can be shown to be inherited.  It is important to note that the most commonly affected cat breed is the regular “domestic shorthair” cat, suggesting that many cases have no clear inheritance pattern. To date, no viral or nutritional causes of HCM have been identified in humans or cats. What Are the Consequences of the Thickened Left Ventricle? Unlike thickening of the walls in response to a physical stress (e.g. weight lifting, or elite cycling) where the thickening occurs to deal with the extra workload placed on the heart, the thickening with HCM is not normal. The degree to which the muscle walls thicken ultimately determines the clinical severity of the disease – some cats (and people) have mild disease, others have severe disease.  Additionally, in humans, different mutations cause different degrees of thickening. As HCM develops and progresses, the structure and function of the heart is altered in several ways. The hallmark problem with HCM lies in the inability of the left ventricle to relax appropriately. The thickened left ventricular walls become less flexible which prevents the left ventricle from relaxing or stretching sufficiently to fill with blood from the left atrium. This abnormal relaxation and inability to stretch may ultimately result in a build-up of blood “upstream” of the left ventricle – namely the left atrium and the pulmonary circulation. As the blood backs up, fluid is forced from the pulmonary capillaries into the lungs and chest cavity causing pulmonary edema and pleural effusion, respectively (commonly called congestive heart failure, or CHF). Very occasionally (probably <5% of the time), in cats, the thickening leads to arrhythmias and can result in sudden death (akin to what is seen in young basketball players that suddenly die on the court). It is difficult to predict which cats are likely to do, but sudden death is relatively uncommon in cats (compared to humans with HCM). A small number of cats can suffer fromfeline aortic thromboembolism (FATE)– a blood clot in the aorta that causes blockage of blood flow to the back legs (most commonly), leading to sudden paralysis, severe pain, and often, death. How Do Cats with HCM Present? The clinical signs of HCM are variable. To some degree, the clinical signs depend on the severity – mild disease doesn’t cause obvious problems, but severe disease often does. Additionally, cats are masters at masking problems until they become severe, so cats with severe HCM may appear completely normal or have only subtle signs that go unnoticed (i.e., mildly increased respiratory rate) or they may be very nonspecific to heart disease (i.e., decreased appetite). On the other hand, an owner may notice signs such as respiratory distress secondary to congestive heart failure or leg paralysis secondary to a thromboembolic (blood clot) event. In many cases, the first an owner knows about the disease is when a veterinarian informs them that they heard an abnormality during a regular or routine examination.  A veterinarian can clue in on signs when he or she listens to your cat’s chest during their physical exam. A heart murmur, and/or gallop rhythm (extra heart sound) or an arrhythmia can be heard in many cats with HCM that are showing no outward signs of disease. How is HCM Diagnosed? An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) with color flow and spectral Doppler imaging offers the best means to diagnose HCM. Echocardiography allows a veterinarian to observe the physical structure and dynamic function of the heart. Fortunately, the test is non-invasive and poses essentially no risk to the cat. Unfortunately, it is a relatively specialized procedure and can be expensive. Electrocardiograms and radiographs provide additional useful information and are often used to assist a veterinarian in diagnosing HCM, but cannot be used alone to diagnose the disease. Since very subtle structural and functional changes can occur within the heart in the early stages of HCM, it is strongly recommended that a veterinary cardiologist be consulted for diagnosis as well as subsequent management of the disease. Some veterinarians will run a blood test looking for changes in proteins produced exclusively by the heart (NT-proBNP).  Elevations in this protein can be seen in cats with HCM, but are not a specific or sensitive means of detecting the disease.  As previously mentioned, additional tests might be needed to rule out underlying diseases such as systemic hypertension or hyperthyroidism which can cause hypertrophy of the left ventricle similar to that seen with HCM. If no other causes are found, the diagnosis of HCM is made. Two breeds (Maine Coon and Ragdoll) have been identified with mutations in the same gene (Myosin-binding protein C) as a cause of HCM.  A genetic test has been developed to test these breeds for the mutation, and is offered throughNorth Carolina State University.  The test does not work in other breeds. How is HCM Treated? Currently, there is no cure for HCM. The changes occurring to the heart muscle are irreversible. However, if your pet’s left ventricular hypertrophy is secondary to some other underlying heart disease, such as hyperthyroidism, treatment of the primary disease can result in some or complete resolution of the heart condition. As previously mentioned, hypertrophy of the heart muscle affects the ability of the left ventricle to relax properly, and therefore, function appropriately. While veterinarians might prescribe one or more medications to try to improve the heart’s relaxing ability, it is important to recognize that no drugs have been shown to be effective in achieving this. Thus, attempts to reduce the risk of heart failure and to help the heart function efficiently are largely theoretical and may ultimately be of no value. Some treatment options that may be prescribed include: As an owner of a cat with HCM, you should be very sensitive to changes in your pet's condition and should not hesitate to seek veterinary advice. Your veterinarian might show you how tomonitor your cat's respiratory rateas an increased rate may be a sign that congestive heart failure is developing or worsening. Cats with congestive heart failure do not generally cough, but often exhibit open mouth breathing and panting. A cat that is having difficulty breathing from heart failure or has loss of function of hindlimbs or front limbs, requires veterinary care as quickly as possible. In the acute setting, these problems often need specific treatments (oxygen therapy, injectable medications, anticoagulation medications, or pain medications) that can only be offered by a veterinarian. What is the Prognosis of a Cat with HCM? The prognosis of a cat with HCM is highly variable. Some cats might develop only mild hypertrophy and suffer little compromise of heart function, while others progress to more severe disease. HCM might worsen quickly over a period of months, or it may progress slowly over several years. Its severity might not change for many years and then suddenly worsen. Some cats with HCM die very suddenly even though they had no clinical signs of heart disease. A cat with mild to moderate disease may enjoy an essentially normal life for a number of years. However, the prognosis is much more guarded once the cat has more severe disease. The risk of developing congestive heart failure is proportional to disease severity, which is often classified by measuring wall thicknesses and left atrial size. Although congestive heart failure can be treated medically, severe heart failure may become difficult to manage over time as the disease progresses. The prognosis for a cat with heart failure, unfortunately, is guarded to poor. On average, survival for cats with HCM and heart failure is 12 to 18 months after diagnosis. Thromboembolism is a severe uncommon complicating condition in HCM. It can cause acute pain and various clinical signs such as loss of function of the hindlimbs (most commonly, although other organs or limbs can be affected). Although treatment to break down or remove the clot is available, the high treatment costs of the procedure, death during administration of the drugs and high recurrence rate of thromboembolism dissuades most from attempting this type of therapy. With supportive care, about 40 to 50% of patients with thromboembolic disease will break down clots on their own and regain limb function over time. However, despite the best medical efforts to prevent their reoccurrence, a cat that has survived a thromboembolic event has a significant risk of developing another over the following weeks to months. To Breed or Not to Breed? In some forms of HCM, an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance has been documented in some breeds. Not only does that mean it can be passed on genetically, but also that males and females are equally affected; every affected cat will have at least one affected parent; and all carriers of even a single copy of the gene can show the disease and transmit a mutant gene to half of their offspring. In two breeds (Maine Coon and Ragdoll), a specific genetic mutation has been identified and a test has been developed to identify cats with the mutation. So what does this mean if you want to breed Maine Coon or Ragdoll cats? If the DNA test is positive for that mutant gene, the cat may develop HCM. As in people, not all individuals with the mutation will develop the disease. Breeding recommendations are currently all over the place. Some people currently recommend that if the cat has two copies of the gene, the cat should not be used for breeding. Rather, the cat should be screened periodically to see if he has the disease. But if the cat has one copy of the gene, he should also be screened periodically for the disease, although his status for breeding is much better. On the flip side, some veterinarians feel that any cat with the mutation should be spayed or neutered. However, the gene pool for purebred cats is pretty small, which colors all breeding considerations. If all the cats with the mutation in one generation are not bred, you might end up with far too much inbreeding, which would ruin the breed anyway. Therefore, some people recommend that cats who have one copy of the mutation and who have no clinical evidence of the disease may be used to breed to a mutation-negative cat. Offspring of that cat should be carefully evaluated and, if possible, a mutation-negative kitten should be used for a breeding replacement. Before breeding your cat, be sure you understand all of the possibilities of what could happen. Genetics is an area that not all veterinarians are comfortable discussing. Discuss with your veterinarian whether referral to a geneticist or cardiologist or would be best for you and your pet.

Category: Cat's Teeth Examination for Cat Owners
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It's easy to recognize if your cat has a broken leg, but how about a broken tooth? You would think pets would stop eating when they had oral problems. Unfortunately, this is not usually the case. By the time most owners recognize oral disease in their pets, the problem is chronic and progressive. So what can a loving cat owner do? Monthly examinations of your cat's mouth are easy and can be rewarding. If you are not sure, check with your veterinarian to make sure your cat is friendly enough for a safe oral exam. It is best to place your cat on a well-lit, sturdy table. Exams performed on the floor can be difficult and unrewarding. A brief oral exam should only take a minute or two. Most pets are easy to work with. If your cat growls anytime during the exam or seems irritated, it would be wise to stop. Before opening your cat's mouth, examine the face for swelling, especially below the eyes. Frequently a broken upper fourth premolar tooth will cause an abscess that may spread below either eye. Fractures of the upper canines (fang or eye teeth) can also cause swelling on top of the nose. Next, feel around the neck below the ears. Abnormal swelling of this area can occur from infection, cancer, or inflammation. Next, take a whiff of your pet's breath. How? Gently pull the lips back to expose the side of your pet's teeth and gums. If there is a foul odor, care is often needed. Since cats cannot brush their own teeth, gingivitis and periodontitis are the most common diseases affecting our feline friends. Reddening of the tissue where the gum meets the tooth may represent inflammation, infection, or trauma. In cases of advanced periodontitis, there may also be bleeding and discharge from the gums. Treatment of gingivitis consists of cleaning and polishing the teeth to remove built up plaque. Depending on the degree of periodontal disease, surgery may also be needed to remove pockets that develop around teeth. Daily brushing is usually easy and essential to control gingivitis. Examine the teeth for fractures. Unfortunately, cats sometimes eat things that are not friendly to their teeth. If the object chewed is harder than the tooth, fracture may occur. Broken teeth with nerve exposure will usually result in an infection at the tooth's tip. Food and bacteria will travel down the root and may eventually affect your cat's heart, liver, and kidneys. Treatment involves removing the tooth or root canal therapy in selected cases. Gently press on the teeth and note any movement. Loose teeth should be reported to your veterinarian. If your pet’s teeth are not routinely brushed, periodontal disease and loose teeth will usually occur. Bacteria by-products under the gum line destroy the bone that holds teeth in their sockets, creating loose teeth. Eating with loose teeth can become uncomfortable for your pet. The front incisor teeth are usually affected before the back teeth. Treatment is available to try to save loose teeth. Most cats older than three years old will have tooth resorption, which can be painful. Tooth resorption commonly occurs at the gum line. If your cat will allow it, gently press a cotton swab to the gum line around the outside of the teeth. If your cat starts quivering and chattering, there is probably tooth resorption. Treatment is to pull the affected tooth. Oral growths may be benign or cancerous. Some tumors occur at the gum line while others are found below the tongue or on the inside of the cheeks. Hopefully, immediate care may result in a cure. Monthly oral exams can uncover hidden disease. The more you look, the more you may find. When problems are noted, your veterinarian should be called in for a closer exam and treatment. In the long run your cat will probably live a longer and happier life, and would thank you.

Category: Cleft Palate or Lip in Puppies and Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Congenital clefts in the palate or lip are birth defects that puppies and kittens can get in the tissues connecting parts of the mouth.Human babiesalso get them. These cleft defects happen when the roof of the mouth does not close correctly before the baby is born. Cleft lipis a defect of the lips, underlying bone, and/or front area of the roof of the mouth, also known as a hard palate. Oftentimes, part of the lip will be missing or misshapen. Sometimes, one or both nostrils appear to connect directly to the mouth. Cleft lip may also be called a harelip because the face appears similar to that of ahare’s. Cleft palateis a malformation or disconnection of the tissues that form the roof of the mouth. The soft palate towards the back of the mouth can be involved. A hole may be in the palate because the tissues never fully connected to each other while the fetus was developing. Severe palate defects result in holes from the palate that connect directly to the nasal passages. The big problem with a cleft lip or palate is that it is difficult, if not impossible, for the affected puppy or kitten to latch on properly to a nipple and therefore they cannot eat properly. Depending on the severity of the cleft, the infant may not be able to get sufficient nourishment at an age where lack of nutrition can completely compromise the infant’s health and ability to grow. Causes Many conditions and issues can cause cleft defects. Congenital clefts can be an inherited birth defect; genes may be passed from the mother or father to the developing fetus. Because of this, pets with a cleft lip or cleft palate should not be bred as they have a high likelihood of passing on the cleft genes to their offspring. Occasionally there are other causes, such as trauma during fetal development. During pregnancy, too little folic acid or too much vitamin A given to the mother can result in cleft defects, although that is rare. Many medications, if given to a pregnant cat or dog, may also cause cleft birth defects. These include steroids such as prednisone, aspirin, anti-seizure drugs, and griseofulvin. Certain viral infections or illnesses can lead to congenital clefts in puppies and kittens if the mother is sick while pregnant. Luckily, most of these issues are rare. Signs Signs are not always obvious, especially if the defect is minor. An abnormal appearance to the lip may be visible, or you may not even see any problems because they are so far back in the mouth. Animals with severe defects where the mouth connects to the nose may have nasal discharge. Milk, saliva, and/or food may come out of the nose during or after feeding. If food material gets lodged in the nasal passage way, nasal discharge may be green or mucus-like. In addition to signs of cleft, signs of complications can be seen at home. If the cleft connects with the nasal cavity, the puppy or kitten may cough when trying to eat or drink. Pneumonia can occur due to cleft palates or cleft lips: trouble chewing and properly swallowing food can lead to food or milk in the lower airways and lungs instead of the stomach. Pneumonia will also result in coughing as well as trouble breathing. For those who appear to eat well enough on their own, poor growth, decreased activity level, and slow development may result from not getting enough nutrition. Diagnosis Your veterinarian will do a thorough physical examination. Sedation is sometimes needed for a good look in the mouth. If the pet has symptoms of pneumonia, X-rays and lab work may be needed. If surgery is planned, advanced imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, may be necessary but that is rare. Treatment Cleft lips that do not connect the mouth directly to the nose can be left alone if they do not cause any symptoms. However, for those with symptoms, surgery is usually needed. Without surgery, food can get stuck in the malformed areas, leading to serious infections. In severe cases, pets with cleft palates can’t eat or swallow properly, and will become ill from lack of nutrition. Unfortunately, surgery is costly, and multiple attempts may be needed to close the defect. Most surgeons recommend waiting until the puppy or kitten is older and strong enough to handle anesthesia, if the pet can wait that long. If surgery is delayed,tube feeding(either through a tube inserted into the back of the mouth, through the nose, or directly into the stomach) may be necessary to help keep up with the growing baby’s nutritional needs. Treatment for associated respiratory diseases may require hospitalization where the infant can get IV fluids and IV or oral antibiotics. Prognosis If a pet has no signs, it may survive and live on to be a healthy adult. Improvement from surgery is not guaranteed, and chances of survival are decreased if the pet is sick or if the symptoms are severe. If you are a breeder, call your veterinarian for a checkup if you notice your puppies or kittens have a facial deformity, have trouble drinking milk, cough or spit up frequently, or do not thrive like the rest of the litter. Also call your veterinarian if you see similar signs in your new puppy or kitten. Early intervention can prevent some of the issues associated with clefts such as infections and may help improve your pet’s chances for a healthy outcome.

Category: Clinical Signs of Oral or Dental Disease in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you see any of these clinical signs, take your pet to your veterinarian for a complete oral examination.  Your veterinarian may need to sedate or anesthetize your pet, in order to complete the examination..  Dental radiographs (X-rays), not “skull films” (a radiograph of the entire head) may be necessary in order to make a proper diagnosis.  Intra-oral radiographs are essential for deciding what’s going on and what needs to done.  If your veterinarian is unable to take dental radiographs, is unsure of a diagnosis, or if the treatment is beyond the clinic’s level of dental experience, ask for a referral to a veterinarian who has an advanced certification in dentistry. (SeeAmerican Veterinary Dental CollegeorAcademy of Veterinary Dentistry). Preventive care involves brushing and daily examination of your pet’s mouth. Brushing needs to be done at least 3 to 4 times a week, if you want to make a difference in your pet’s oral health.  Plus, by looking in your pet’s mouth while you are brushing, you will be more aware of any oral abnormalities (oral masses, bad breath, missing teeth) or the increased redness of the gums that indicates periodontal disease and the need for a trip to the “Animal Dentist.” By working with your primary-care veterinarian and a dental specialist, you are sure to increase your companion’s quality of life by providing proper and timely dental and oral healthcare.

Category: Dental Care in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Feline dental care is perhaps the most overlooked and under-treated area in small animal medicine. Cats are affected by many of the same dental problems that affect dogs, including periodontal diseases, fractured teeth, and oral growths. Cats are also plagued with tooth resorption and inflammation. More than half of cats over three years old havetooth resorption(s)(TR). These tooth defects have also been called cavities, neck lesions, external or internal root resorptions, FORLs and cervical line erosions. Affected tooth roots often erode and disappear when they are replaced by bone. The lower third premolars and molars are most commonly affected; however, tooth resorptions can be found on any tooth. The specific cause for tooth resorption in cats (and dogs) is unknown, but theories supporting an autoimmune response have been proposed. Cats affected with tooth resorption may show excessive salivation, bleeding in the mouth, or have difficulty eating. Tooth resorptions can be quite painful but many affected cats hide their pain. Most times it is up to the veterinarian to diagnose tooth resorption on oral examination with x-rays. Diagnostic aids include an explorer dental probe or cotton swab applied to the suspected resorption; when the probe touches the lesion, it causes discomfort and jaw spasms. Treating a tooth resorption is extracting the affected tooth to bring relief. Cats can also be affected by stomatitis, an inflammatory condition. The cause of this disease has not been determined but an immune-related cause is suspected. Signs in an affected cat include bad breath, difficulty swallowing, weight loss, and excessive salivation. X-rays often reveal moderate to severe periodontal disease with bone loss. Managing a case of oropharyngeal inflammation can be challenging. Oftentimes attempts at conservative therapy are not affective, nor is medical care. Extracting specific or all the teeth resolves the syndrome in 60 percent of the cases. The remaining 40 percent require life-long medication to be comfortable. The carbon dioxide laser has also been used successfully in controlling inflammation after extraction in refractory cases. Some cats have fractured teeth from cat fights and other forms of external trauma. The canines are most commonly affected. Fractured teeth are commonly sensitive because the nerve is exposed. Even if the nerve is not exposed the affected tooth can be sensitive. Root canal therapy or extraction generally brings relief. Cats are also affected by cancer in their mouths.Squamous cell carcinomais the most common type of oral cancer. Less common feline oral malignancies include melanoma, fibrosarcoma, lymphosarcoma, and undifferentiated carcinomas. Not all feline oral swellings are malignant Biopsies are essential for diagnosis. Cats can be affected by many oral and dental conditions, which once diagnosed and treated are pain-free and happy bites.

Category: Gingivostomatitis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is it? Feline gingivostomatitis (FGS) is a severe, painful oral disease that affects some cats where the cat’s mouth becomes allergic to plaque on the teeth and tongue and gums. The allergic response appears as striking inflammation throughout the mouth. What causes it? Plaque bacteria is the specific cause. What is unknown is why some cats get the disease and others that have plaque do not.  The disease does not appear to be related to feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, sex, spaying or neutering, or diet. What are the signs of FGS? Severe inflammation around the teeth and the back of the mouth exists with FGS. Affected cats may drool, have really bad-smelling breath and have difficulty chewing hard food. Mouth pain may also cause a decrease in self grooming, resulting in a scruffy hair coat. How is it diagnosed? An examination usually reveals inflammation completely surrounding the teeth. The upper and lower cheek teeth are most commonly affected. In some cases, the canines and incisors as well as the back of the mouth are also involved. How is FGS treated? Treatment is surgical. After the affected teeth are removed (usually those behind the canines) in the upper and lower jaws, most cases heal.  In some cats all the teeth need to be removed.  Twenty percent of the cats treated will not heal with surgery alone, and for those cats laser treatment and medication usually bring relief. What is the prognosis? After the teeth are extracted, the prognosis is excellent in most cases.  Fortunately domestic cats do not need their teeth to live a great long life.

Category: Periodontal Disease in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Unfortunately, most adult dogs and cats have periodontal disease. Imagine if you didn't brush your teeth for days, weeks or months. Plaque is a transparent adhesive fluid composed of mucin, sloughed epithelial cells, and aerobic gram-positive cocci. Plaque starts forming within two days after professional dental scaling and polishing. If the plaque is not removed, mineral salts in the food will precipitate to form hard dental calculus (tartar). Rough calculus covered with plaque is irritating to the gingival tissue, changing the pH of the mouth and allowing bacteria to survive subgingivally. By-products of these bacteria harm the tooth's support structures, often causing pain and the tooth to be lost. Every professional dental visit should include probing and charting. A periodontal probe is an important instrument used to evaluate periodontal health. A probe is marked in millimeter gradations and gently inserted in the space between the gingival margin and tooth. A probe will stop where the gingiva attaches to the tooth or at the apex of the alveolus if the attachment is gone. Intraoral radiography supplies important information when deciding which teeth can benefit from surgery and which should be extracted. There are two common grading systems commonly used to classify the degree of periodontal disease. The mobility index evaluates the looseness of the tooth. There are three stages with stage 3 indicating advanced periodontal disease necessitating extraction. Anatomically the periodontium is composed of the gingiva (gum), cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar supporting bone. Periodontal disease can also be staged by the degree of periodontium affected as measured with the periodontal probe and intraoral radiographs. When periodontal disease is not treated, subgingival bacteria can continue to reproduce, potentially creating deeper periodontal pockets through bone destruction. Eventually, this progression can cause tooth loss and systemic disease. Treating Periodontal Diseases    The goal of treating periodontal disease is to decrease or eliminate the periodontal pocket. What needs to be considered when planning periodontal care? The best outcomes result from a committed client, a cooperative patient, and a treatable tooth. The client needs to be committed to saving their pet’s teeth. This commitment includes twice-daily plaque control either through brushing, wipes, or products accepted by theVeterinary Oral Health Council. Frequent veterinary dental progress re-examinations and expenses should also be considered and discussed before choosing any surgery. The patient must also be a willing four-legged partner. If the dog or cat will not allow home care, the best dental surgeon and the most caring owner will not make a difference. Unless there is strong owner commitment and patient compliance, it is much wiser to extract a tooth affected by moderate periodontal disease rather than letting the pet suffer. Once the clinician is convinced that he is working on the right patient and tooth, the appropriate type of periodontal surgery is chosen. An ideal method allows exposure of the root surface, preserves the attached gingiva, and allows the gingiva to be resutured in a fashion to eliminate the periodontal pocket promoting reattachment to the root surface. At one time gingivectomy was the treatment of choice to eliminate pocket depth and allow exposure of the root surface for cleaning. Unfortunately, part of the important attached gingiva is sacrificed in the gingivectomy procedure. Gingivectomies should only be used in cases of gingival hyperplasia where there is an overgrowth of tissue or when mucogingival surgery to preserve the attached gingiva is not practical.

Category: Stomatitis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cats can be affected by inflammation of the entire mouth, called stomatitis or feline gingivostomatitis (FGS). An immune-related cause is suspected due to the large amount of plasma cells encountered on microscopic examination of the inflamed tissues. Some of the affected cats have difficultly eating, weight loss, decreased grooming, and excess salivation. Oral examination often reveals redness in the throat area and severe inflammation where the teeth and gums meet. The cheeks are usually affected more than the canines and incisors.   In addition to generalized inflammation, there may be all stages oftooth resorption. The cause of feline stomatitis is thought to be an exaggerated immune response to plaque. The cat actually becomes allergic to its own teeth. In the past, therapy options for feline stomatitis included thorough teeth cleaning and polishing, fluoride, corticosteroids, gold therapy, antibiotics, lasers and daily brushing. In most cases cats were only temporarily helped with these therapies and the cats remained in pain. The treatment of choice is decrease the plaque retentive surfaces in the mouth, which usually involves removing many teeth. After a tooth-by-tooth examination, including dental x-rays, the veterinarian determines which teeth need to be extracted. In some severe cases all of the teeth are surgically removed. Fortunately domesticated cats do not need their teeth to survive. The mouth heals in a short time and the cat is back to eating better than ever before! Tooth extraction improves the lives of most cats affected by stomatitis. Some will need additional medication and therapy.

Category: Tooth Resorption in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A common feline oral malady is tooth resorption (TR). Greater than half of all cats older than three years old will have at least one tooth affected by resorption; it affects dogs less frequently.   These tooth defects have been called cavities, neck lesions, external or internal root resorptions, feline odontoclastic resorption lesions (FORLs), and cervical line erosions. Tooth resorptions are usually found on the outside of the tooth where the gingiva (gum) meets the dental hard tissue. The lower jaw premolars are mostly affected, however tooth resorption can be found on any tooth. The cause is unknown, but theories supporting an autoimmune response, calicivirus, and metabolic imbalances relating to calcium regulation have been proposed.  The resorption generally starts at the cemento enamel junction (gum line) and progresses inward, eroding sensitive dentin. Once the resorption is exposed to the oral cavity, bacteria invade causing pain and jaw spasms. Increased salivation, oral bleeding, or difficulty eating are other signs. Unfortunately, most times there are no outward signs. It is up to the veterinarian or astute owner to diagnose tooth resorption. There are five recognized stages and three types of tooth resorption. Initially in stage 1, only an enamel defect is noted. The lesion is usually minimally sensitive because it has not entered the dentin. In stage 2, the lesion penetrates enamel and dentin. When resorption progresses into the pulp chamber (nerve) stage 3 has occurred.  In stage 4, large amounts of the tooth's hard structure have been destroyed. By the time stage 5 has occurred, most of the tooth has been resorbed, leaving only a bump covered by gum tissue. Intraoral radiographs (X-rays) are essential to evaluate all the teeth to determine the best course of therapy. Depending on what is seen on the visual patient exam and the intraoral X-rays (tooth resorption type 1, 2, 3), treatment involves following the resorption until it is exposed to the oral cavity, extraction of the entire tooth and roots, or a partial tooth extraction.  In cats affected by stage 5 without inflammation, treatment is not necessary.

Category: Adverse Reactions to Spot-on Flea and Tick Products
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Spot-on flea and tick products for dogs and cats have greatly improved the safety and convenience of controlling external parasites on our pets. Using pesticides that are many degrees less toxic and frequently more effective than the organophosphate or carbamate dips and sprays of the past, these spot-on products help keep our pets (and our homes) free of annoying pests that can also carry serious diseases. When used according to the label directions, spot-on products are well tolerated by most pets. However, as with any product that is applied directly on the skin, there is the possibility that certain individuals will have adverse local reactions to one or more ingredients in the product. Some individuals will have similar reactions to many different spot-on products with different active ingredients, suggesting that their sensitivities may be to some of the inactive ingredients. These reactions are restricted to the area of skin that comes in direct contact with the product, so they do not reflect a systemic toxicosis but rather a local hypersensitivity. Skin reactions to spot-on products can vary from mild tingling sensations to actual chemical burns of the skin in especially sensitive individuals. The mildest form of skin reaction to spot-on products is epidermal paresthesia, which is defined as an abnormal sensation such as an itch or prickling of the skin. Paresthesia occurs when the applied product "tickles" the nerve endings in the skin, causing the characteristic sensation. Although paresthesia may occur with any spot-on product, it is most commonly associated with products containing concentrated pyrethroids such as permethrin, cyphenothrin, and etofenprox. Pyrethroid paresthesia is a syndrome that has been well documented in both humans and animals. Human descriptions of pyrethroid paresthesia vary from "tingling" to "pins and needles" to "burning" sensations in the skin at the site of pyrethroid contact. These sensations begin within 30 minutes of application and may last 8 to 24 hours if untreated. Some pets appear to experience similar discomfort following application of spot-on products; the fact that the products are generally applied between the shoulder blades can make the sensation particularly annoying to the pets. Affected pets, cats in particular, may become hyperactive and agitated as they try to walk away from the sensation; others may become quiet, subdued and reluctant to move. Skin at the product application site will appear normal (if redness is noted, you're dealing with contact dermatitis, see below). Fortunately, treating epidermal paresthesia is fairly simple and entails bathing off the product with a mild dish soap (pet shampoos are too mild to remove all of the product). For pyrethroid paresthesia, applying vitamin E to the affected skin can provide quick relief— just use scissors to snip open a vitamin E capsule (the kind used as a vitamin supplement) and squeeze the oily contents onto the pet's skin and rub it in. A rare but more significant skin reaction (in terms of sensitivity) to spot-on products is contact dermatitis, in which an inflammatory reaction develops in response to the topically applied product. These responses - sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity reactions - can occur upon the first use of a product, but more commonly occur after several uneventful exposures to the product. The body sets up an inflammatory response to the site of application, and the skin will appear red and irritated. In more severe cases, wheals or blisters may develop and the skin may actually ulcerate. Unlike paresthesia, which tends to occur within 30 minutes of application, oftentimes the onset of contact dermatitis is delayed for several hours, with the full extent of the injury taking 12 to 24 hours to develop. Depending on the degree of the inflammatory reaction, the level of discomfort can range from mild to quite severe. After bathing off the spot-on product, pets who develop more than mild redness at the application site should be seen by their veterinarians for further treatment to reduce the inflammation and discomfort. The good news is that skin reactions to spot-on flea/tick control products are quite uncommon, and most pets will have no problems when these products are used. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict which individual will react to a given product until the reaction has occurred. For this reason, it is a good idea to observe your pet closely for at least an hour following the application of any spot-on product for any signs of discomfort. Although not life-threatening, skin reactions can range from mildly annoying to very painful; for this reason, a pet that has had a reaction to a spot-on product should never have the same product applied in the future. If a spot-on product is still desired for flea and/or tick control, try a product with different active ingredients than the one that caused the reaction. Following application, watch the pet carefully and be ready to bathe at the first sign of problems. Unfortunately, there are rare individuals that cannot tolerate any of the topical spot-on products, and other flea control options such as sprays or dips may be needed. More serious problems can result when spot-on flea/tick products designed for dogs are inappropriately applied to cats. Certain concentrated pyrethroids (e.g. permethrin) that are not harmful to dogs can cause life-threatening tremors and/or seizures if applied to cats—these are not really adverse events but are instead true poisonings since the product was misused.  Always read the label before using any topical flea/tick product on cats, andneverapply products intended for dogs onto cats. Frontline (fipronil) istoxic to rabbits. If your pet has a reaction to a flea or tick control product of any kind, you should report the reaction. All spot-on product labels will have a phone number that you can use to report the reaction to the manufacturer. By law, the manufacturer is required to send monthly reports of adverse reactions to the appropriate federal regulating authority. Alternatively, you can go to the agencies' websites to find out how to report reactions directly to them.

Category: Cutaneous Lymphoma in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Lymphoma is common in cats, but is seen in so many ways and different places that it is confusing. It can be seen in almost any organ. When it affects the skin, it is called cutaneous lymphoma. Lymphocytes, or lymph cells, are white blood cells and part of the immune system. Lymphocytes travel throughout the body. Some lymphocytes line organs to provide immunity against infection. When the lymphocytes become malignant with cutaneous lymphoma, however, skin tumors can develop almost anywhere on the skin. Besides the haired parts of the skin, these tumors can be seen at the lip margins, the eyelids, the anus/rectum, the vulva, and the prepuce of the penis (the fold of skin covering the penis). A specific, poorly understood form of cutaneous lymphoma seems to occur near the hock, which is the ankle of a back leg. A cat can also have skin tumors and lymphoma elsewhere in the body at the same time; often it's seen in the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, kidneys, mouth, or nasal passages. As with non-cutaneous lymphoma in cats, each case is different. The disease is complex and there are several forms of it. Unfortunately, there is no overall consensus from the veterinary community on what the best course of action is in any individual cat. The cause is unknown in most cases. Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus can cause lymphoma in cats, but don’t seem to be involved in most cases of cutaneous lymphoma. Lymphoma in cats can rarely happen at a vaccine site, but mostvaccine-associated tumorsare other kinds of cancer, not lymphoma. Cutaneous lymphoma can look like skin nodules, masses, ulcers, or just areas of skin that are flaky, bald, or changed in color. Some of the skin tumors can be large.  As time goes on, the skin often becomes thick, red, ulcerated, and may ooze fluid. Cats can also have signs of internal disease such as swollen lymph nodes, a lack of appetite, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, and general weakness. For diagnosis, a piece of tissue is taken from the skin tumor, usually with either a biopsy or a fine needle aspirate. It is examined under the microscope. Cutaneous lymphoma can look like some other skin diseases, so enough testing must be done to ensure accuracy. Blood tests and a urinalysis may be needed. More tests like X-rays, ultrasound, or tissue samples may be used to see if other organs besides the skin are involved. Treatment is much like other cancers. Surgery can sometimes remove skin masses or lesions. This surgery can be useful to get tissue to make the diagnosis. If the cat is lucky and the lymphoma is ONLY at one place on the skin, surgery may also help for treatment, but this situation is rare. It’s much more common for lymphoma to involve lots of different organs at once. Even if only the skin is affected, there are usually too many sites for surgery to help. Chemotherapy is the main form of treatment for that reason as it can help multiple areas of the body at once. If all goes well, it can be really effective at reducing the lesions even in a short time, although this result may not last. Radiation may occasionally be helpful for skin lesions occurring in just one spot. Rarely, cases with lymphoma in multiple spots on the skin have also been treated with a superficial form of radiation that treats the skin without affecting deeper organs. Corticosteroids pills such asprednisoloneare often part of chemotherapy for cutaneous lymphoma. If the corticosteroids are used by themselves when more effective therapy isn’t an option, they may give some temporary relief. Sadly, there is no cure and the long-term prognosis is poor. However, chemotherapy can slow progression and temporarily improve a cat’s quality of life. On average, cats treated for cutaneous lymphoma will only survive for less than a year. Some cats live longer, though, and cats whose disease starts out at only one spot might be likely to do better.

Category: Demodectic Mange in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Demodexmites are normal residents of the skin in virtually all mammal species. For the most part, they live in peace in our hair follicles and are not able to spread to another host, much less cross to another species. The cat is no different and provides a home toDemodex cati,which does not cause skin disease unless the host becomes immune-compromised and the mites proliferate unchecked. Unfortunately, the cat is also host to two otherDemodexmite species that are very much contagious to other cats and readily cause skin disease.  The nature of the skin disease with either type of mite infection can be quite variable ranging from over-grooming (also calledfur mowing) to raw weepyeosinophilic granuloma complexlesions to the dry seed-like scabs commonly referred to as miliary dermatitis. Feline demodicosis is usually itchy. Demodectic mange in dogsis extremely common, especially in puppies. Demodicosis in cats is much more unusual. Two Types of Mange, Three Types of Mange Mites Demodex catiandDemodex gatoiare the two mainDemodexmites of cats with a third species recently described but yet unnamed.Demodex catiis long and slender, resembling a short-nosed alligator, whileDemodex gatoiis short, stubby and hardly has any tail at all. The unnamed mite is slightly bigger thanDemodex gatoibut also short-tailed. Demodex cati, as mentioned, lives inside hair follicles whileDemodex gatoiand the unnamed mite live more superficially in the skin. For all intents and purposes, the unnamed mite has biology similar to that ofDemodex gatoiand appears to respond to the same therapies so from here on out we will discuss feline demodicosis as either of the "cati" type or the "gatoi"type.  Diagnosis Most of the time diagnosis is confirmed with a skin scraping or similar skin sampling technique. Occasionally mites are found during examination of a fecal sample because itchy cats will groom and swallow their skin mites (especially in the event ofDemodex gatoiinfection where the mites are superficial in the skin and readily licked away). If skin scrapes are negative for an itchy cat, a fecal sample is a good way to cover all bases. It is important to determine which mite is present as the treatment and consequences will be very different When disease is caused byDemodex catithe mites are fairly easy to find. WithDemodex gatoi,a small number of mites can lead to a great deal of inflammation. The smaller numbers make them harder to find. Sometimes we must go by response to treatment to diagnoseDemodex gatoias they are elusive. Treatment forDemodex cati BecauseDemodex catilives deeper in the hair follicle, it is sensitive to treatment in a way thatDemodex gatoiis not. Effective treatments include topical fluralaner (Bravecto®). Other flea products of the isoxazoline class (such as Revolution Plus®) may also be effective but the Bravecto product uses a uniquely high dose so as that a single dose can last 3 months, and this may be important. Daily oral ivermectin or milbemycin may be used. The moxidectin topical product Advantage Multi® can be effectively used at the off-label frequency of every two weeks againstDemodex cati.Historically lime sulfur dips once or twice weekly for 6 dips has been used but since dipping a cat in a stinky chemical solution is no fun for any of the parties involved, the topical products currently dominate the recommendations. The good news regarding treatment is that sinceDemodex catidoes not create a contagious disease, only the affected cat needs to be treated. This is not so forDemodex gatoi. The bad news is that aDemodex catiinfection suggests a problem with the cat’s immune system and it is important to seek a second disease that might result in immune suppression. Expect further testing to be needed. Treatment forDemodex gatoi This species of mite is considered to be contagious among cats so if it is confirmed or strongly suspected in one cat, then all the cats in the household must be treated. Treatment of choice involves a series of six dips of two-percent lime sulfur given at weekly intervals. The cat must soak in the dip, which regrettably stinks of rotten eggs, for at least five minutes and must air dry afterwards. The dip not only smells bad but will stain fabric and jewelry and can temporarily impart a yellow tinge to white fur. Because of these unpleasant factors and because many cats are not amenable to being quietly bathed, these dips are frequently performed in the veterinary hospital. It should be noted that the dips are also very drying to the skin so that conditioners may be needed by the third week to prevent dandruff. As noted, ifDemodex gatoihas been confirmed or is strongly suspected, all cats in the home must be treated. There is temptation not to treat cats that are not showing symptoms but it is possible for cats to carryDemodex gatoiwithout showing symptoms, so they all must be treated to avoid the potential for a carrier cat reinfecting the others. If no response in the skin condition is seen after three weekly dips, however, andDemodex gatoiwas never actually confirmed, this would suggest that another disease is causing the problem and dipping may be abandoned. Dipping is labor-intensive and unpleasant for all the reasons noted above. It would be great if an oral treatment such asivermectincould be used. Unfortunately, becauseDemodex gatoilives on the surface of the skin, ivermectin cannot reach it and it is not a reliable treatment. Fluralaner (Bravecto®) and other isoxazoline flea products have been miraculous for canine demodectic mange and it is hoped that they will be useful for the feline situation, but research is lacking at this time and dipping remains treatment of choice. Treatment of Cats Testing Negative for Mites Demodex catiis relatively easy to find when a cat has it, so a negative scrape largely rules out this infection. If there is any question, one of the topical treatment plans above can be used to take care of any undetected mites.Demodex gatoi, however, is a bit of a trickster and can be difficult to find when it is there. As mentioned, the systemic treatments may not be reliable for this mite as it lives so superficially in the skin. For these cats, dipping can be performed on a trial basis. Dips are given once a week for three weeks. If the cat is notably improved after this time frame, then three more weekly dips should be performed. The other cats in the home should be dipped for six dips each as well. Response to lime sulfur dip is seen in conditions other than demodicosis, so you cannot necessarily infer demodicosis from results. That said, other conditions that might respond,ringwormfor example, would likely necessitate lime sulfur treatment of the entire household cat population anyway.

Category: Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is a Granuloma? A granuloma is a solid grouping of inflammatory cells coming together in a lump or solid structure. What is an Eosinophil? An eosinophil is a type of white blood cell that is commonly associated with allergic responses or parasitism. Eosinophil counts often go up on a blood test when a pet has fleas or worms or when an allergy is flaring up. Eosinophils can circulate in the blood, from where they can leave to enter tissues. They are part of the immune system and are on patrol for biochemical signals from tissue (calls for help, if you will) telling them that a parasite has invaded. Eosinophils activate when they receive these signals and release chemicals to attack the parasite. Unfortunately, they can be tricked into thinking that benign materials (pollen, dust, etc.) are attempting to invade. In this instance (allergy), they release their inflammatory chemicals inappropriately, creating the sensations of itching, swelling, redness, and other symptoms of allergy. The eosinophil has a characteristic appearance under the microscope due to the pink staining granules. The pink staining granules contain assorted toxins and biochemicals designed to attack an invading parasite. These granules can be thought of as small bombs directed against large invading organisms such as worms. So what is the Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex? Given the above information, it would seem logical that an eosinophilic granuloma would be a granuloma made up of eosinophils; however, the situation is more complicated. Initially, it appeared that eosinophilic granuloma was just what it sounds like but as it was studied more thoroughly, it was found that there were three different classes of this condition, and not all were granulomas and not all involved eosinophils. Furthermore, the name eosinophilic granuloma implies a final diagnosis, but this is generally not the case, either. Eosinophilic granuloma lesions are more like symptoms of a variety of underlying causes such as allergy or even bacterial infection.      The three classes of eosinophilic granuloma complex are listed below. An individual cat may have any or all of them.      The three classes are:     These conditions are felt to most commonly have an underlying allergic basis though it is not always possible to determine what that allergic basis might be. The presence of any of the three above conditions does not definitively imply any specific type of allergy. In fact, there is some evidence that some cases begin as simple allergic reactions to an external substance but when internal skin proteins are released by scratching, the reaction continues to involve these “self” proteins as well.  The Indolent Ulcer (also called the rodent ulcer) Cats with indolent ulcers have an erosion on the margin of their upper lip. Sometimes, a proliferative eroded structure also develops on the tongue so if your cat has a classical lip ulcer, it is a good idea to open the cat's mouth and check.   In general, the appearance of the indolent ulcer is classical and a biopsy is not needed; though occasionally these are precancerous conditions and a biopsy may be needed to rule out a malignant skin tumor. If allowed to go untreated, the ulcer can be very destructive to the upper lip. Even after treatment, the ulcer will likely heal but the area of the lip that has been destroyed will not grow back and the cat's face will be permanently altered.  The Eosinophilic Plaque This lesion typically looks like a raised thickened raw area of skin usually on the belly, inner thigh, anal, or throat area. Cats with these lesions are commonly extremely itchy. A microscope slide pressed onto the affected area often picks up numerous eosinophils that can be detected under the microscope (the cytology test), thus confirming this condition. Often bacteria can be identified with cytology as well, suggesting that infection can contribute to these lesions. Cats with this condition generally have increased circulating eosinophils in their bloodstreams as well. The Eosinophilic GranulomaThe eosinophilic granuloma, which is also called linear granuloma or collagenolytic granuloma,  produces a classical swollen lower lip or chin or a classical long, narrow lesion running down the back of the thigh. Sometimes proliferations grow from the actual footpads where they ulcerate as the cat is forced to walk on them. There is some tendency for this condition to occur in adolescent kittens though it can occur at any age. What Exactly is Happening to These Cats? The eosinophilic granuloma complex represents a disorder of eosinophil function. The eosinophil’s real job is to attack parasites. It is designed to be attracted to areas where parasitism is occurring and once there it releases biochemicals to destroy the invading creature. In cats with eosinophilic granuloma complex, eosinophils are called to the site of an allergic response, and the biochemicals released cause damage to local collagen. As mentioned, the reaction can include “self” proteins as well as external ones. The eosinophilic granuloma patterns, as specific as they can be, do not point to a specific cause. The most common cause is some kind of allergy, and treatment is generally about trying to determine the specifics of the allergy and suppress that reaction. Treatment The best approach is to try and find the underlying allergy, but determining what the cat is allergic to is often easier said than done and takes time. For more immediate results while other issues are investigated, corticosteroids are frequently the "go-to" therapy. These could be given as long-acting injections such as Depo-Medrol® or as oral medications. Some lesions respond to antibiotics without the use of steroids.Lesions that are more refractory are another story. A biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma; tumors or other ulcerative lesions may mimic the eosinophilic granuloma complex. Biopsy may also elucidate less obvious underlying causes such asDemodex mitesorringwormfungi. (Keep in mind eosinophilic granuloma represents an inflammatory reaction to proteins deemed foreign by the eosinophils.) After diagnosis, treatments might include: Other treatments that have been used when other options have failed includedoxycycline(an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties), gold therapy (yes, oral medications using gold have been used with mixed success in inflammatory conditions), removing the lesion via laser or cryotherapy, and daily high doseinterferon-alpha. Female hormones (such as Ovaban® tablets and Depoprovera® injections) were once widely used for this condition but are now considered inappropriate due to side effect potential (they can cause diabetes mellitus, and pyometra, and can raise the risk of mammary cancer). They would be considered a last resort. The eosinophilic granuloma is an incompletely understood condition. For now, it is best to view it as an extreme symptom of another underlying skin disease.

Category: Feline Acne
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Feline acne is a skin condition of cats that is seen mostly around the chin and lip margins. Hair follicles on the chin become clogged (also known ascomedones). Severely blocked follicles can develop abscesses, which are filled with pus. Surrounding skin can also develop bacterial infections. What Causes Feline Acne? We don’t know what causes it.  Studies have shown that multiple cats in the same household can develop chin acne, so there is likely a trigger of sorts as opposed to a genetic or inherited cause. Some research data suggests that a virus, possibly associated with the upper respiratory tract, may make a cat more likely to get chin acne. Other evidence points to increased production of sebum, an oily substance produced in the skin’s sebaceous glands. This overproduction may predispose follicles to become clogged. Certain diseases also increase the likelihood of feline acne. These includefoodandenvironmental allergies;eosinophilic granuloma complex;ringworm; infection withDemodexmites; autoimmune disorders such aspemphigus foliaceous; and contact hypersensitivity (e.g. skin sensitivity to certain materials or chemicals, such as the plastic used in some food bowls).  What Are the Signs of Feline Acne? The skin on the cat’s chin will be thick, red, and crusty. Clogged hair follicles may be visible. These appear as dark lesions or spots under the skin containing thick material. In some cats, discharge or fluid may be seen on or around the chin. Chin acne is not typically itchy or painful unless the case is severe or the cat also has other infections or diseases.  Other clinical signs may come from any ongoing associated diseases. For example, areas of circular, crusty hair loss may be seen with ringworm, a fungal infection. How Is Feline Acne Treated? Feline acne is best assessed and treated by a veterinarian. Hair on and around the affected areas can be shaved to allow for better cleaning and treatment. Damaged skin will need to be cleaned with antiseptic solutions. In some cases, comedones or abscesses will need to be lanced and drained to allow for better healing. Some cats require oral or injectable antibiotics, but mild cases can be improved with topical medicines alone. Topical therapies include antiseptics, antibiotics, and antifungals, depending on additional infections. Sometimes steroids are necessary to decrease inflammation and discomfort. Steroids can be given topically, orally, or as an injection. Can Feline Acne be Prevented? Typically, feline acne is a chronic disease. While the initial acne and infection can be healed, additional outbreaks may occur. Some research indicates that cats with acne do not groom as well as normal cats. Helping to keep the cat’s chin and face clean and the surrounding hair brushed may decrease the incidence of comedone outbreaks. Controlling any predisposing issues can also help prevent a recurrence. In cases of contact hypersensitivity, changing food and water bowls from plastic to metal, glass, or ceramic may decrease outbreaks; plastic bowls are porous and scratch easily, and are more likely than other types of materials to develop cracks and crevices that hold unhealthy bacteria.  Shallow bowls may also be more beneficial than deeper bowls as they minimize skin contact with the bowl surface as well as the food fed. Ensure that food and water bowls are cleaned frequently with soap and water. If allergies are an issue, discuss methods for decreasing allergy signs with a veterinarian. Long-term topical therapy, such as cleansers or topical medications, may be also necessary to prevent the recurrence of feline acne.

Category: Fleas: Know your Enemy
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although there are over 2000 flea species in the world, pet owners should be concerned with only one:Ctenocephalides felis, the cat flea. This is the flea that we find on our pets (cats, dogs, rabbits, and other species) in 99.9 percent of cases. In order to understand how to control the damage caused by this tiny little animal, learn all you can about it. Fleas can cause serious health problems for you and your pet. Fleas aren’t just a nuisance! Fleas can kill. Fleas suck blood and blood loss leads toanemia. A heavy flea burden is lethal, especially to smaller or younger animals. The cat flea has even been known to kill animals as large as dairy calves through heavy infestation. Fleas can cause serious skin issuesFleas can cause severe itching and also other problems such as skin infections and hair loss. Some animals can become allergic to fleas, andflea allergy dermatitisis the most common skin disease of dogs and cats. Fleas can transmit infections and parasitesFleas can carry and transmit a bacterium calledBartonellathat can cause health issues in cats, dogs, and people. Fleas can carry a type of parasite, atapewormcalledDipylidium caninumthat can suck nutrients from the pet’s intestine and cause anal itching. Common Myths Even though fleas are the most common parasite in dogs and cats, there are many misconceptions about them. Myths that veterinarians hear about fleas almost every day are: Myth: My pet cannot have fleas because he lives entirely indoors. Fact:Fleas thrive particularly well in the well-regulated temperatures in the home. Myth: My pet cannot have fleas because if there were any fleas they would be biting (insert name of a person in the family reportedly sensitive to flea bites). Since this person is not being bitten, there must not be any fleas. Fact:The cat flea,Ctenocephalides felis, can suck the blood of a wide variety of animals. However, this flea definitely does not prefer human blood and won’t eat it unless absolutely necessary. Humans tend not to be bitten unless flea population numbers are high. Myth: We do not have fleas because we only have hardwood floors. Fact:Fleas love to develop in the cracks between the boards of hardwood floors. Myth: My pet cannot have fleas because I would see them. Fact:You cannot expect to see fleas because many animals will lick, groom, and chew after being bitten by a flea. This causes the flea to either jump off the pet or get swallowed. The Flea Life Cycle There are four life stages of the flea. For effective flea control, it is important to know how to break this life cycle in more than one place. The flea life cycle consists of egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. Eggs are laid in the hair coat and are designed to fall off your pet and into your home. Larvae hatch from the eggs and develop in a pet’s environment by feeding on adult flea feces (i.e. digested blood) that fall out of the hair coat of the pet. Larvae eventually spin cocoons, often within carpet fibers, for pupation. Pupae are resistant to freezing, drying, and insecticides, and can lie dormant for many months! New fleas develop from pupae and can begin feeding within hours of finding a dog or cat. The entire flea life cycle can be completed in as little as three weeks. Flea Control Strategies New ProductsToday, veterinarians have some greatflea control productsin our arsenal. There are now many effective and safe new products to choose from. Break the Flea Life CycleA two-step approach, targeting both the adult flea and the egg or larval flea forms, provides the most rapid control and the least resistance to flea control agents in future flea generations. Year-round Flea ControlFleas are also adaptive and the temperature controls how fast the flea completes its lifecycle. If you want to eradicate the flea population in a specific home, it is best to attack when numbers are low in the winter. Stopping flea control products in the winter may make it much harder to gain the upper hand in the spring and summer when the populations are rising. Rotate Flea ProductsOver time, only fleas resistant to an insecticide will survive. Periodically switching to another type of insecticide can be part of an effective flea control program to help reduce developing resistant fleas. Sadly, fleas are here to stay one way or the other. Know as much about this pest as you do about the dogs and cats that it feeds upon. You cannot know too much when it comes toflea control!

Category: Fur Mowing in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is fur-mowing? In short, the cat is licking off all his hair. Often the belly is nearly as bald as if it were shaved. Sometimes a Mohawk of normal fur makes a stripe down the back, surrounded by bald spots on either side. Sometimes it is the lower back itself that is bald. Often the owner thinks the hair is falling out. Often the veterinarian wonders if the problem is really psychological. The good news is that most cats that mow do not have mental illness. The answer is almost always much simpler: cats lick off their hair because they itch and it is important not to launch into treatment with psychoactive drugs until causes of itching have been ruled out. For example, in a recent study of 21 cats referred to the University of Guelph Veterinary Teaching Hospital Behavior Service because of excessive hair licking, only two cats were ultimately believed to have a psychological reason for hair licking, and sixteen cats were found to have a true medical basis for itching, and three cats had both. But let us go back to the beginning: the cat with a big bald spot. How Do We Know the Cat's Hair is not Simply Falling Out? A truly observant owner will see the cat licking the area, but cats, being private creatures, often do their licking when no one is watching. One might wonder why it is that the itchy dog creates moist, red, oozy, unpleasant-lookinghot spotswhile the itchy cat cleanly licks away only the hair while leaving the skin itself not in the least bit scabbed, red, or even raw. This turns out again to be the feline nature: refined. Private and refined. Sometimes the mowing cat will have some hot spots as well or a patch of scabs but often there is only a bald area with normal-looking skin exposed. The truth is simple: there are only a few rare diseases that actually will lead a cat to lose hair in great patches but, if someone still remains skeptical, there is a test called a trichogram that will confirm the answer. A trichogram involves plucking a hair from the affected area. There are most likely at least a couple of hairs in the area but if there are not, hairs from the margin may do as well. Under the microscope, the end of the hair is flat from having been broken off. A hair shedding from the skin will have a tapered, natural end. Obvious Reasons to Itch Before embarking on an extensive battery of tests, it is important to rule out obvious causes of itching. The easiest such cause to rule out is a flea infestation. If live fleas or flea dirt are seen in the coat, then the answer is obvious. If fleas are not seen, you cannot assume there are no fleas to be found, particularly if the lower back is one of the balding areas. Cats are efficient groomers and can lick away all traces of fleas, so we may need to go by the pattern of hair loss, (lower back, possibly including scabbing around the neck). hair loss that changes with the seasons and response to flea control. The first step is virtually always going to be ensuring immaculate flea control. After fleas have been removed from the picture, the cat can be reassessed in a couple of months for hair regrowth and/or with a fresh trichogram. If fleas are not obvious right from the beginning, again, they should not be considered ruled out as a cause but further investigation will be needed. To properly determine if there are fleas in the household, a flea comb is especially helpful. Flea combs have narrow teeth that can trap live fleas and flea dirt. The cat who is mowing may not have evidence of fleas, but if there are fleas on one of the other pets in the house, you can bet the mowing cat has them too. Figuring out the Not-So-Obvious Causes A step-by-step process is important in ruling out hidden allergies, parasites, and evenringworm. First, the non-invasive tests are performed: If these non-invasive procedures have not yielded the answer, then there are some choices to make in the approach. Your veterinarian may have a preference as to the order, but the following are several possibilities that might be chosen, each answering different questions. Skin Biopsy This can likely be accomplished the same day as the initial visit and yield results as soon as 48 hours later. It is important that the samples be read by a pathologist who specializes in reading skin tissue so your veterinarian may want to request an expert or use a specific laboratory. In this procedure, a local anesthetic is injected into selected areas of skin and an instrument called a punch biopsy (which resembles a tiny cookie cutter) is used to remove small plugs of skin. The cat will probably have a stitch in each area where a sample was taken. Food Allergy Trial The only way to determine if the cat has a food allergy is to put the cat on a trial diet that the cat could not possibly be allergic to (either a hydrolyzed protein diet or a novel protein diet) for a long time and see if the mowing stops. How long? Many cats respond in three to four weeks but some require a good 2 months, so to be sure, a two-month trial is typically recommended.The advantage of this test is that it can make the correct diagnosis and provide treatment. See our related page onfood allergiesfor more details. Flea Control Trial As mentioned, immaculate flea control is very important in ruling out fleas as a cause of mowing, and it is crucialnotto assume that if fleas are not seen, then they must not be involved. There are numerous sophisticated flea products available, and every veterinarian has a favorite. Your veterinarian will instruct you on a schedule for use in this situation it may be more frequent than the manufacturer's recommendation). The trial should continue for at least 6-8 weeks, after which the cat can be reassessed for hair regrowth or reduction in licking. To save time, the food trial and flea control trial can be done at the same time. If the cat has not responded after two months, another disease/condition can be pursued. If the cat responds after two months, the cat can be challenged with the original diet. If mowing recurs (which generally takes two weeks at the most on the original diet), then the food allergy is the answer. If the cat continues not mowing after the original food is introduced, then the problem is flea-related. Demodectic Mange Dipping Trial Demodectic mange mites can be difficult to find in cats, especially if the cat is over-grooming. It is important to realize that a negative skin scrape does not mean that the cat doesn't have mites. Fortunately, there is another way to determine if the cat hasDemodexmites; the cat can be treated for mites to see if the mowing stops. The cat is treated with lime dip weekly for three weeks. If there is improvement in hair regrowth or a reduction in self-licking, then three more weekly dips are done for a total of six dips, and any other cats in the house are also treated with a total of six dips. A lime sulfur dip is not pleasant. It stains fabric and jewelry and smells like rotten eggs. For these reasons, many cat owners opt for dipping to be done in the hospital rather than at home. Demodexmange mites are more common in certain geographical areas (such as the Southern U.S.) than others. At which point a dipping trial should be done depends in part on the likelihood of demodicosis being the problem. IfDemodexmites are not found on a skin scraping, and they frequently are not even if they are in the skin, then the response to dipping becomes the only way to determine if the cat has them. Lime sulfur dips are very drying to the skin, and special conditioners may be needed after the third dip if dipping is to continue. Steroid Trial For this trial, the patient receives some kind of cortisone-type treatment for three to four weeks. At the end of that time one can tell if the mowing has improved (and the mowing is said to be steroid responsive) it hasn't improved at all (and the mowing is said to be steroid non-responsive.) Knowing whether or not the mowing is steroid-responsive helps classify possible causes. For example, seasonal steroid-responsive mowing is most likely to be from fleas (technically, allergy to the flea bite) or an airborne allergy. Non-seasonal steroid-responsive mowing is most likely going to be from a food allergy or from demodicosis. Steroid non-responsive mowing is most likely to be from a parasitic or fungal problem or a food allergy. Many experts like to do the steroid trial at the beginning of the workup while others wait until more results are in. What if the Cat has Mental Illness? This is generally called psychogenic mowing. We don’t imply that we know if cats are licking out of obsession, anxiety, or even boredom. We simply say that there is nothing wrong with the skin. The approach is aimed at environmental enrichment. This means the cat gets more toys, more games (feeding in a different location daily to create a hide-and-seek sort of cat entertainment), and more attention. See more information onenvironmental enrichmentfor cats. As for anxiety, there are several approaches. Feliway® products employ a pheromone that is naturally made by cats to communicate that a territory is safe and secure. This pheromone is available in a room spray or a plug-in defuser. Alpha-casozepine is a cow's milk protein with mood-stabilizing properties. It can be given as an oral supplement (Zylkene®) or in a commercial diet (talk to your veterinarian). There are also medications for anxiety:clomipramine,fluoxetine, and evenamitriptyline. These can be used to relieve a cat's need for compulsive over-grooming after more conventional causes of itchy skin have been ruled out. Overall, fur mowing can be a frustrating condition for which no cause is obvious, and the only solution is to try different treatments and see what happens. Hopefully, this article has provided some meaningful suggestions for testing and treatment approaches.

Category: Itching and Allergy in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Coping with an itchy cat can be an extremely frustrating experience for you, the pet owner, and can truly test the limits of the human-animal bond.  Persistent scratching and chewing by the pet can also result in open wounds to the skin and pain to your cat.  The following information is intended to help provide pet owners with a basic understanding of the most common underlying causes of itching (pruritus) and allergies in cats. What are the most common causes of chronic itching? Itching in cats can involve not only scratching but also chewing, licking, and rubbing. The common causes of itching in cats are external parasites such asfleasandmange, allergies, and a type of fungal infection called ringworm. Although medications are available to temporarily decrease itching, it is always recommended to find outthe cause of your cat's itching. Otherwise, the itching will return as soon as the medication is stopped. Especially when used over time, some medications such as steriods can result in other health conditions. What are allergies? Allergies are a common cause of skin conditions in cats. People with allergies usually have hay fever (watery eyes, runny nose and sneezing) or asthma. Although cats withasthmacan be allergic, most cats with allergies lick or chew their fur. What are the major types of allergies in cats? Flea AllergyFlea allergic dermatitis is the most common skin disease in cats.  For the flea allergic patient,100% flea controlis essential for remaining symptom-free. “But doctor, I never see fleas on my pet.”  You may not see them, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there!  Flea allergy is caused by the flea’s saliva, and it only takes a few bites to cause a problem.  Also, the itchy pet often scratches or licks so much that adult fleas are hard to find because they are removed from the body. “If fleas are the problem, why is my pet still itchy in the winter?”  In warm climates or in our homes, fleas may survive in low numbers year-round.  Because flea allergy is so common, many veterinarians recommend instituting complete flea control before proceeding with test for itching. For most allergic pets, year-round flea treatment is an important part of reducing itch. Food AllergySome pets develop hypersensitivities to foods. Various food proteins, carbohydrates, or even preservatives or dyes can all be potential food allergens. There is currently no accurate blood or skin test to determine if your cat has a food allergy. The only method of diagnosing a food allergy is by placing your pet on a carefully selected prescription or homemade hypoallergenic diet for several weeks, which is called afood trial. The diet only contains ingredients your pet has never eaten before. If the allergy signs resolve, a food challenge is performed by feeding the former diet and watching for a return of the itching.  If this occurs, a diagnosis of food allergy is confirmed. Atopic DermatitisAtopic dermatitis(AD) is an inherited predisposition to developing skin problems from exposure to a variety of commonplace and otherwise harmless substances including the pollens of weeds, grasses and trees, as well as housedust mitesand mold spores.  In cats that have been diagnosed with AD, allergy testing by intradermal skin testing or in vitro blood testing can identify what a pet is allergic to in the environment.  Evaluating the results of these tests helps us compile a list of allergens for a “vaccine” to decrease the pet’s sensitivity. Secondary InfectionsAllergies are often the underlying cause of recurring skin and/or ear infections.  Bacterial and yeast infections, though secondary to the allergy, can increase your pet’s level of itching. Can allergies be cured? Unfortunately, there is no cure for allergy and it is usually a life-long problem. We seek to control allergies and improve the quality of life for both you and your cat.  We will formulate the best program of management that suits all involved with your cat’s care. Can itching be treated without the expense of diagnostic testing? There are many anti-allergy medications to reduce itching.  These medications do not cure allergies but can help decrease the symptoms. However, without addressing the underlying cause of the allergy, the itching will return when the medication is stopped.  Long-term use of some anti-allergy medications, such assteroids, can result in many health problems.  Working with your veterinarian to diagnose the underlying cause of the allergy and itching may reduce the need for medications or enable your veterinarian to use more specific and targeted allergy treatments.

Category: Notoedric Mange in Cats (Feline Scabies)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Notoedric mange is the scabby, scaly, skin disease resulting from infection by the feline miteNotoedres cati.Notoedresmites are closely related tosarcoptic mangemites of dogs and thus the two infections have some similarity. Both conditions typically begin with itchy crusts and scales on the ear margins. Notoedric mange progresses to involve the face and ultimately, if the skin disease is ignored, it will cover the cat’s entire body. The term scabies is somewhat colloquial and refers to a mite infection with any of the mites inSarcoptidaefamily. Many veterinary dermatologists never see this condition in their entire careers; in the United States, notoedric mange is considered rare with regional hot beds of infection. How is Diagnosis Confirmed? A scraping of the crusty skin can be examined under the microscope. Mites and/or their eggs are generally not difficult to detect if they are present; still, their absence does not rule out notoedric mange. Sometimes a trial course of treatment is needed to fully rule out the infection. The mite is highly inflammatory, hence the intense itching. Consider that when one cat at home is diagnosed with this condition, all cats at that home may require treatment. Can the Infection be Transmitted to other Pets or to Humans? Yes, it can.Notoedresmites are spread by touch and they can certainly infect humans, dogs, or rabbits. They do not live off their host for more than a few days at best, thus transmission is generally by direct contact with an infected individual. Treatment There are several options for the treatment of this condition. Isoxazoline Class Flea Control Products At present, there are three products labeled for feline use: Fluralaner (Bravecto®), Lotilaner (Credelio®) and Saralaner (Revolution Plus®). These medications are the newest insecticides for cats and have become popular for killing fleas and ticks but they are also effective against mites suchNotoedres cati. None of these products is actually approved for use againstNotoedres cati; because of the rarity ofNotoedresit is unlikely that any company will pursue official approval. A single dose should be effective and regular use of these products for flea control should be preventive. Selamectin (Revolution® and Revolution Plus®)This topical medication was designed for flea,heartworm, and intestinal parasite control. In dogs, it is approved for control of sarcoptic mange mites but due to the rarity ofNotoedrescati, as noted above, the manufacturer is unlikely to pursue the expensive process of gaining FDA approval for Notoedric mange. Still, selamectin, is effective againstNotoedres catiand regular use of it for flea control seems to be preventive. Moxidectin (Advantage Multi® and similar brands)This product is another monthly topical flea preventive similar to the other ones listed. As with the others, regular use is preventive. Advantage Multi is used against fleas, ear mites, heartworm,roundworms, andhookworms. IvermectinUsually given as an injection, this medication was one of the first treatments used againstNotoedres cati. It is still used today. Treatment is typically weekly or every 2 weeks for a month and recovery is prompt. Doses approved for heartworm prevention in cats are not high enough to treat Notoedric mange; different dosing is needed. DippingIn the past, a series of six or seven lime sulfur baths or amitraz dips were used to control this infection. While this certainly works, the cat’s general dislike of bathing created need for something more convenient. Furthermore, lime sulfur has an extremely objectionable smell and will discolor fur. Amitraz tends to produce sedation in some patients and headaches in some humans. Not surprisingly, this method is rarely used nowadays. This is Pete before and after he was treated with one dose of ivermectin.

Category: Plasma Cell Pododermatitis (Pillow Foot) in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Plasma cell pododermatitis is a foot pad disease of cats that is fairly classical in its appearance yet its significance is poorly understood. Plasma cell pododermatitis literally means foot inflammation involving infiltration by plasma cells. Plasma cells are activated lymphocytes in full maturity suddenly and severely producing antibodies, usually in response to an infection or at least in response to some kind of inflammatory process. The fact that a cell of the activated immune system is involved implies that there is some sort of immune stimulation in the genesis of the disease. Supporting this idea is the observation that therapy targeting the immune system generally controls the disease. So it looks like there is an immunological basis for this disease but, unfortunately, understanding has not progressed far enough to suggest an actual cause for the immunologic problem. Some studies have found a link between plasma cell pododermatitis andfeline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)infection so it is important to screen an affected cat for this virus. Exactly what the link is between these two conditions remains unclear but approximately 50 percent of cats with plasma cell pododermatitis are FIV-positive. Other cats will respond to a food allergy diet trial which suggests allergy may be involved in some cases. It may well be that many factors can be involved in creating this disease. Confirming the Diagnosis An affected foot pad develops a classic mushy appearance and balloons out as shown in the photo. The skin of the pad may develop a purplish tint and may even ulcerate. All four feet may or may not be affected but rarely is only one foot afflicted. Some cats may be lame, especially on severely affected feet. On blood tests, cats with plasma cell pododermatitis usually have elevated numbers of circulating lymphocytes and high circulating antibody (globulin) levels, so such findings are supportive of making this diagnosis. Furthermore, other foot pad swellings such as tumors, insect bites, or proliferations fromeosinophilic granuloma complexusually only affect a single foot. If the physical appearance of the foot is not obvious, a biopsy of the foot pad should confirm the condition, thus leaving no question. Less invasively, a needle aspirate can be used to harvest some cells from the affected foot and check for an abundance of plasma cells. Treatment Modification of the underlying immune reaction is the core of therapy for cats in which therapy is deemed necessary by your veterinarian. At this time, the treatment of choice is oral doxycycline.  While doxycycline is an antibiotic, it also has immunomodulating properties and we believe it is these properties that are effective in treating plasma cell pododermatitis. Approximately 50 percent of affected cats will show a good response after two months of therapy. When the condition is in adequate remission, the doxycycline is continued for several months further before discontinuing and seeing if the condition recurs. Alternatively, high doses of an oral steroid such asprednisolonemay be helpful for cats that did not respond todoxycycline.Cyclosporine, another immunomodulator that is available as a liquid, has also received attention for treating this condition. Should medicating a cat daily prove a bit daunting, another therapy choice might involve injections of methylprednisolone acetate (depomedrol), a long-acting steroid, though there is some potential for side effects. Alternatively, injections of dexamethasone, a shorter-acting steroid, can be given regularly at home. Large ulcerated masses on the footpads may require surgical removal. In most cases, the condition is manageable and the cat can be made comfortable.

Category: Psychogenic Alopecia
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In the cat, overgrooming, licking, biting, chewing, and compulsively pulling out hair can lead to hair loss, thin, uneven coats, or baldness. This behavior typically has a medical cause that must be ruled out before a behavioral diagnosis of psychogenic alopecia can be made. Psychogenic means “of the mind”. Psychogenic alopecia, also known as self-trauma, is a condition in which cats compulsively pull out their hair, leading to thin, uneven coats or baldness. This behavior typically serves as a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning all possible medical reasons must be ruled out before a behavioral diagnosis can be made. Psychogenic means “of the mind”. A study by Stephen E. Waisglass, et al., published inThe Journal of the AmericanVeterinary Medical Association,involving 21 cats suspected of this condition, found that 16 had medical reasons for their behavior, two were purely cases of psychogenic alopecia, and three had medical and behavioral causes. The medical issues primarily included unfavorable reactions to food, allergies, or parasites, with half of the cases having more than one cause. Causes When this hair loss due to self-trauma has behavioral causes rather than medical, it is called psychogenic alopecia. Behavioral causes are often linked to environmental stress, frustration, or conflict. Potential triggers for this behavior range from changes in the household environment, including the introduction of new pets or people, to competition for resources in multicat households, lack of hiding spaces, insufficient mental enrichment, and even the sight of neighborhood cats. Although it can also stem from a compulsive disorder, this is relatively rare. Cats in multicat households are particularly prone to displaying this behavior when their basic needs are unmet. Clinical Signs Initially, the skin may appear irritated due to pruritus (itch). Itchiness can lead to scratching and licking, chewing, biting, and hair loss, and is the most common symptom of skin disease in cats and dogs. The areas most affected are the flanks (sides). You may not initially notice your cat is overgrooming, as it often occurs only when they are alone or at night; however, the effects on the skin can be seen. Diagnosis To diagnose the reason for hair loss in your cat, your veterinarian may start with basic tests, including cytology, to look for infections and skin scrapings to check for mites, followed by fungal cultures and flea medications. They may also conduct blood tests and a urinalysis, along with a thyroid profile, to assess your cat’s overall health. Allergy testing or making a switch to a hypoallergenic diet may be recommended. If testing does not identify the cause of your cat’s hair loss, glucocorticoids like prednisolone may be prescribed. Diagnosing this condition can be challenging, as both self-inflicted trauma and stress can lead to physical symptoms. However, a primary behavioral cause is more likely if there is a minimal response to treatment with no significant findings from these tests. Treatment The treatment plan for this type of hair loss centers around treating the underlying medical conditions present and meeting the basic needs of your cat, which includes environmental modifications. Known as The5 Pillars of a Healthy Feline Environmentby Sarah Ellis et al., a list of basic needs was published in theJournal of Feline Medicine and Surgery.These include: Positive reinforcement training can provide social andmental enrichment,improving communication between you and your cat. It also helps in teaching behaviors that can redirect your cat from overgrooming to different activities, reducing overall stress levels. Punishment, such as yelling, physical punishment, or spraying your cat with water, is never recommended. If specific stressors are found, behavior modification can be employed to help your cat develop positive associations with whatever is causing them distress. Medical Therapy for Psychogenic Alopecia Behavioral medications can be helpful in some cases and include: Monitoring and Prognosis for Psychogenic Alopecia After the self-trauma has stopped and the hair has regrown, you may be able to slowly discontinue behavioral medications while watching your cat to make sure the same behaviors do not start all over again. Be sure to consult with your cat’s veterinarian before discontinuing any medications. Your cat’s long-term prognosis depends on what the underlying cause is for the behavior. Some cats may need medications for a long time, or even for life, while others may not. With psychogenic alopecia, some cases are easier to treat than others; effective methods may be identified early on, while some behaviors may never completely disappear. Much depends on the extent to which you can address your cat's source of stress and how well secondary skin infections caused by the trauma of overgrooming can be managed.

Translating Return to English Ringworm Environmental Decontamination: How to Clean Your Home When Your Pet Has Ringworm Dermatophytosis, commonly calledringworm, is a fungal infection of the fur and skin of dogs and cats. When your pet has ringworm, it is really important to clean and disinfect your home to prevent the spread of ringworm to other pets and to people. How to Clean and Disinfect the Home Thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the home when a pet has ringworm is called environmental decontamination and is a two-step process.STEP 1: Remove pet hairWipe, sweep, and/or vacuum the surface then thoroughly wash the surface until visibly clean of pet hair. Remove any excess water before Step 2.STEP 2: Disinfect the surface.Apply disinfectant and let sit for 5 min.Step 1 is the most important step because many surfaces can be rid of ringworm by removing pet hair. Additionally, many disinfectants do not work in the presence of debris. Below is a guide to cleaning and disinfecting various materials.

Category: Ticks Are Arthropod Parasites for Mammals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Ticks are skin parasites that feed on the blood of their hosts. Ticks like motion, warm temperatures from body heat, and the carbon dioxide exhaled by mammals, so they are attracted to such hosts as dogs, cats, rodents, rabbits, cattle, small mammals, etc. The bite itself is not usually painful, but the parasite can transmit diseases and causetick paralysis, which is why tick control is so important. (Removing the ticks leads to rapid improvement of the paralysis.) The minimal amount of time it takes for an attached tick to transmit disease is not known. The time it takes to transmit diseases is affected by the type of disease organism, the species of tick, etc. However, in general, if a tick is removed within 16 hours, the risk of disease transmission is considered to be very low. Therefore, owners can usually prevent disease transmission to their pets by following a regular schedule to look for and remove ticks. The Tick Life Cycle Most types of ticks require three hosts during a 2-3 year lifespan.  Each tick stage requires a blood meal before it can reach the next stage. Hard ticks have four life stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Larvae and nymphs must feed before they detach and molt. Adult female ticks can engorge, increasing their weight by more than 100-fold. After detaching, an adult female tick can lay approximately 3,000 eggs. During the egg-laying stage, ticks lay eggs in secluded areas with dense vegetation. The eggs hatch within two weeks. Some species of ticks lay 100 eggs at a time, while others lay 3,000 to 6,000 per batch. Once the eggs hatch, the ticks are in the larval stage, during which time the larvae move into the grass and search for their first blood meal. At this stage, they will attach themselves for several days to their first host, usually a bird or rodent, and then fall onto the ground. The nymph stage begins after the first blood meal is completed. Nymphs remain inactive during winter and start moving again in spring. Nymphs find a host, usually a rodent, pet, or human. Nymphs are generally about the size of a freckle. After this blood meal, ticks fall off the host and move into the adult stage. Throughout the autumn, male and female adults find a host, which is again usually a rodent, pet, or human. The adult female feeds for 8 to 12 days. The female mates while still attached to her host. Both ticks fall off, and the males die. The female remains inactive through the winter and in the spring lays her eggs in a secluded place. If adults cannot find a host animal in the fall, they can survive in leaf litter until the spring. What are the best ways to deal with these blood-sucking parasites? Outdoor Environmental Control Treating the yard and outdoor kennel area with acaricides (tick pesticides) is an important tool in the arsenal against ticks. Some products can be used to spray the outdoor area. However, you should not rely on spraying to reduce your risk of infection. If you have health concerns about applying acaricides, check with local health or agricultural officials about the best time toapply acaricides in your area, identify rules and regulations related to pesticide application on residential properties, and consider using a professional pesticide company to apply pesticides at your home. You can also create a tick-safe zone in your yard by using some simple landscaping techniques that can help reduce tick populations: Indoor Environmental ControlIf ticks are indoors, flea and tick foggers, sprays, or powders can be used. Inside, ticks typically crawl (they don't jump) and may be in cracks around windows and doors. A one-foot barrier of insecticide, where the carpeting and wall meet, can help with tick control. Preventing Ticks from Attaching If your pet goes outside regularly, you can use some type of residual insecticide on your pet. Talk to your veterinarian about what works best in your geographic area. If you use a liquid spray treatment, cats and skittish dogs typically prefer a pump bottle because of the noise from aerosol cans. Doubling the amount of anti-tick product, or using two at once, may cause toxicity problems.Any spray insecticide labeled for use on clothing should not be sprayed directly on pets. Powders are fairly easy to apply, but they can be messy. (Avoid topical powders if your pet has a respiratory condition.) Shampoos are useful only for ticks that are already on your pet. A tick collar might be somewhat more water-resistant than a residual insecticide, so if your dog likes to swim, the collar might be a better choice. Flea combs can be used to help remove ticks and wash your pet's bedding frequently. Finding and Removing Ticks The best way to find ticks on your pet is to run your hands over the whole body. Check for ticks every time your pet comes back from an area you know is inhabited by ticks. Ticks attach most frequently around the pet's head, ears, neck, and feet, but they are not restricted to those areas. There are several tick removal devices on the market, but a plain set of fine-tipped tweezers will remove a tick quite effectively. How To Remove A Tick With Tweezers Risk of disease transmission to you, while removing ticks, is low but you should wear gloves if you wish to be perfectly safe. Do not apply hot matches, petroleum jelly, turpentine, nail polish, or just rubbing alcohol alone. These methods do not remove the ticks and they are not safe for your pet. Rubbing alcohol could be used to disinfect the area before or after removing the tick. Watch for Infection and Diseases After you pull a tick off, there will be a local area of inflammation that could look red, crusty, or scabby. The tick’s attachment causes irritation. The site can get infected; if the pet is scratching at it, it is more apt to get infected. A mild topical antibiotic, such as over-the-counter triple antibiotic ointment, can help but usually is not necessary. The inflammation should go down within a week. If it stays crusty and inflamed longer than a week, it might have become infected. Various diseases can be transmitted by ticks includinganaplasmosis,babesiosis,ehrlichiosis,Lyme disease,tick paralysis(or tick toxicosis), and others. Not all species of animals (pets or not) are affected similarly by every tick-borne illness. Although ticks can transmit diseasescontracted from a previous hostto pets and humans, they are usually nothing more than a nuisance. The best approach is to prevent them from embedding and once embedded, to remove them quickly. If you notice your pet experiencing signs of illness or acting differently after a tick bite, it is always best to see your veterinarian. If you stay on top of the situation, your pets should cruise right through the tick season with no problems.

Category: AAFCO Pet Food Labeling
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pet food marketing can get confusing. The labeling does not provide detailed nutritional information and it’s easily misunderstood by consumers. Try as you might, sometimes reading the label doesn’t give you enough answers. However, the more you know about what pet food labels indicate – and don’t – the better off your pet will be. What is AAFCO? AAFCOis the go-to organization for understanding animal feed, including food for pets. It does not regulate or inspect anything, nor is it a government agency. It is a group whose members are government agencies representing the 50 states, Canada, and the federal government. It is not a regulatory body and has no ability to monitor or enforce specific food manufacturing procedures. Animal feed specialists indicate to them what is appropriate for a specific species, and AAFCO provides model feed laws. AAFCO does not approve or certify any pet food, treat, or supplement products. The FDA, not AAFCO, regulates pet food, and FDA is a member of AAFCO. State feed control officials can choose to adopt these model feed laws – if they do, then monitoring and enforcement duties are the responsibility of the individual state. Pet food manufacturers that sell food must comply with all relevant federal or state laws. Most pet foods sold in multiple states will comply with the AAFCO guidelines. AAFCO relies on current scientific knowledge to provide guidelines for pet food composition which, if followed,minimize the risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, the FDA enforces food safety through the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, which demands that pet foods, like human foods, be “pure and wholesome, safe to eat, produced under sanitary conditions, contain no harmful substances, and be truthfully labeled.” Therefore, pet food manufacturers are legally responsible for providing nutritionally adequate, safe, and wholesome products that conform to local, state, and federal law. AAFCO requires nine components to be printed on a pet food label:  What are the different AAFCO nutritional adequacy designations for pet foods? There are four possible AAFCO nutritional adequacy statements that can appear on pet food labels. These must be printed verbatim as one of the following: How are AAFCO feeding trials conducted? The guidelines for an AAFCO feeding trial vary depending on the diet type being evaluated. There are four protocols: maintenance, growth, gestation/lactation, and all life stages. Although the minimum standards for each type of trial must be met, companies may add on other components to a feeding trial, such as plasma amino acid measurement, digestibility studies, full blood chemistry panels, and complete blood counts to gain additional information about the suitability of their diets for the life stage being tested. Foods can be put through AAFCO feeding trials even if they do not qualify for a “formulated to meet AAFCO” feeding statement due to deficient or excessive levels of nutrients. One example is veterinary therapeutic diets formulated for chronic kidney disease, which are intentionally formulated to contain phosphorus (+/- protein) at concentrations below the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles for adult maintenance; many of these have passed maintenance feeding trials and thus have a “feeding trial” nutritional adequacy statement on the bag. If they have not undergone feeding trials, they must carry the statement: “This product is intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.” Such diets are not allowed to reference the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles on the label. Theoretically, the flip side is that diets that fail feeding trials but contain nutrient levels within the specified minimum and maximum concentrations per AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles can be marketed with a “formulated to meet” adequacy statement. Ideally, diets are formulated to comply with the concentrations specified by the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles and then pass appropriate feeding trials. Foradult maintenance canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Forgrowth canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Forreproduction canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Do AAFCO feeding trials accomplish what they claim to accomplish? Many pet owners and clinicians have raised the concern that AAFCO feeding trials do not represent what really happens in a pet’s life, i.e., that feeding a diet for six months is not the same as feeding a diet for 10 years. That is true. However, although AAFCO trials are imperfect, they do identify most serious acute and semi-acute nutritional deficiencies or excesses, and some minor ones. Furthermore, manufacturers are free to supplement the minimum protocol requirements with additional measures of nutritional adequacy. Also, consider that diets for growth, gestation/lactation, or all life stages get tested more rigorously compared to maintenance since the nutritional demands of those animals are greater. Evaluation of diets under AAFCO guidelines also includes an examination of the nutrient content of the diet being tested. The nutrient content can be determined either by testing a sample of the finished diet or by using the nutrient content of the individual ingredients in the food to calculate the diet composition. The latter is less desirable, since ingredients are naturally variable in nutrient content and because processing and nutrient interactions could alter bioavailability (how much can actually be absorbed and used by your pet's body) in the final diet. There is no requirement for either in vivo or laboratory testing of pet food products if the formulation method of substantiating nutritional adequacy is used. Some companies have performed other in vivo testing (in-vivo meaning taking place within a living thing) and even lifelong feeding trials to demonstrate that their diets provide complete and balanced nutrition for the expected feeding duration (i.e., “for life”). How can you identify the pet foods that have undergone “more rigorous” testing of their pet food, rather than just the AAFCO statement on the bag? Unfortunately, you can't. Even veterinarians can’t. The pet food label is really a legal document and is not designed to convey significant nutritional information. As much as some sources (such as internet ranking lists) would like it to be possible, you cannot evaluate 'quality' from the label, especially from ingredient lists. You need to consider the manufacturer (reputation, experience, investment in AAFCO trials and research, etc.), cost, availability, and how your pets are doing on various diets. Board-certified veterinary nutritionists in clinical practice are alerted to dietary issues with specific diets because of extensive interaction with clients, practitioners, and each other. Therefore, these specialists are often a reliable resource for determining which diets are causing disease problems. In addition, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Nutrition Toolkit developed by the WSAVA Global Nutrition Committee provides many useful nutrition resources includingRecommendations on Selecting Pet Foods. This document lists eight questions to help owners assess pet foods: Factors to consider about a brand: Things to look for on a pet food label: It is ideal for a manufacturer to have a qualified nutritionist as a full-time employee rather than just as a consultant. Dr. Cailin Heinze, a board-certified nutritionist, additionally prefers companies that perform testing above and beyond AAFCO trials, especially with veterinary therapeutic diets. Furthermore, Dr. Heinze looks for company longevity as a sign of a successful track record and is critical of “guerrilla marketing” in pet supply stores (aggressive, emotion-based strategies directly to consumers). Finally, she looks for companies willing to share full nutritional profiles (e.g. full or typical analysis) of their diets rather than just a guaranteed analysis, and provide updated information with regular batch testing. Understanding what’s best for your pet isn’t always easy. Oftentimes the only way to get a clear answer to your question is to telephone (not email) the manufacturer. However, the best chance for your pet’s good health is to begin with food bearing an AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement on its label.

Category: Bacterial Diarrheas in Puppies & Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bacterial diarrheas are generally a nuisance for the adult animal but can be lethal to a small puppy, kitten, or even a human baby. Most of these problems stem from contaminated food or fecal contaminated environment.Feeding raw food dietsto pets dramatically increases the exposure to infectious organisms to the humans in the family. Since these conditions are also human diseases, it is helpful to have some understanding of what they are, even if there are no young pets or immune-suppressed individuals (human or otherwise) at home. Campylobacter Campylobacterspecies are a group of bacteria capable of causing diarrhea in dogs, cats, humans, and other animals. They have a unique curved appearance under the microscope and are said to be sea gull-shaped.  They are difficult to isolate as they grow in conditions of low oxygen (making them microaerophilic as opposed to being aerobic or anaerobic bacteria). With regard to pets,Campylobacterare generally a problem for the very young. Puppies and kittens have not yet matured immunologically. Plus, because they are small, fluid loss from diarrhea hits them much harder. Furthermore, puppies and kittens are more likely to be housed in groups where fecal cross-contamination is common so they may be more likely to become infected than adult animals. Adult animals commonly haveCampylobacterorganisms living in their intestines, but they do not experience any sickness due to it. In humans,Campylobacterinfection is a leading cause of gastrointestinal (GI) disease; infected dogs and cats can carry the organism and spread it even if they do not have symptoms themselves.  For this reason, pets used for therapy in assisted living communities and similar situations should be screened forCampylobacterby fecal culture before exposure to people with suppressed immunity. Humans are also infected by consumption of contaminated food, water, or raw milk; only 6% of humanCampylobacterinfections are attributed to dog exposure.  That said, exposure to a dog with diarrhea triples a person’s risk for developing enteritis fromCampylobacterjejuniorCampylobacter coli. Studies screening pet animals for inapparentCampylobacterinfections have found surprisingly high incidences of inapparent infection. In one study in the Midwest, 24% of 152 healthy cats were positive, for example. After consuming Campylobacter organisms, they travel to the lower small intestine, attach, and multiply. They produce a toxin that destroys the lining of the intestine with the result being a bloody, mucous diarrhea (though occasionally a more watery diarrhea is described).  Sometimes a fever results, appetite becomes poor, and vomiting can occur.  Incubation is 2 to 5 days.  The organism can survive as long as a month in environmental feces. Diagnosis is made by seeing the sea gull-shaped organisms under the microscope; however, there are so many bacterial organisms on a fecal sample that finding the culprit can be tricky. For this reason, a culture is often performed as a more accurate test. Because the organism is microaerophilic, specific culture requirements must be met; the facilities of a reference laboratory are needed. Treatment is with appropriate antibiotics, such aserythromycin,chloramphenicolortylosin. Salmonella Most people are somewhat familiar withSalmonella.They know it represents a type of food poisoning, probably know it is associated with diarrhea that can be severe, and may even know thatSalmonellaspecies are bacteria. Most human cases ofSalmonellainfection cause fever, diarrhea, and cramping that go away on their own, but in children, it can produce more severe disease. As withCampylobacter, the young are more susceptible to more severe illness because they are smaller and do not have mature immunity.  The same is true with puppies and kittens; adult animals are almost never affected bySalmonellainfection. An important exception to the "Salmonella is rare in adult dogs" rule is the case of dogs fed a raw food diet. It has become popular to feed raw foods to pets with the idea that a raw food diet more closely approximates the natural diet that the feline or canine body evolved to consume, and thus, such a diet should be healthier than commercially prepared foods. In fact, cooking food is central to removing parasites, bacteria, and bacterial toxins from food. A recent study evaluating raw food diets found that 80% of food samples containedSalmonellabacteria and that 30% of the dogs in the study were sheddingSalmonellabacteria in their stool. Adult dogs are often asymptomatic, but any infected animal or person will shed the organism for at least six weeks, thus acting as a source of exposure to other animals or people.Salmonellaorganisms are difficult to remove from the environment and easily survive three months in soil. Again, dogs used for therapy around the elderly or children should be cultured forSalmonella. There are two syndromes associated withSalmonella:diarrhea and sepsis.Salmonellabacteria, once consumed, attach to the intestine and secrete toxins. The toxins produce diarrhea that can be severe and even life-threatening in the young. If this were not bad enough, someSalmonellacan produce an even more serious “part two" (sepsis) should these bacteria invade the body through the damaged intestine, causing a more widespread and much more serious infection. In young animals, the syndrome resulting is similar to that of canineparvovirusthus similar treatment is expected. E. Coli Escherichia colimay be the most common bacterial organism in the world. It lives in our intestines naturally and covers the world we live in. Unfortunately, some strains ofE. coliare not so neighborly and are capable of producing diarrhea via toxin production. Like the other organisms we have discussed, this is a serious problem for the very young and more of a nuisance for adults.  There are three main types of unfriendlyE. coli:EnterotoxicE. coli, enterohemorrhagicE. coli,andenteropathogenicE. coli. EnterotoxigenicE. coliis a common cause of diarrhea in young animals as well as human infants and is responsible for the famous traveler’s diarrhea. These bacteria produce what is called an enterotoxin in the upper small intestine. This toxin, similar to the toxin of cholera, causes the intestine cells to secrete the body's fluid into the intestine, creating spectacular watery diarrhea and what can be life-threatening dehydration for smaller living creatures.  Young pigs, cattle, and other livestock are commonly lost to this kind of dehydration. Again, the younger and smaller the patient is, the more serious this infection is. EnteropathogenicE. colialso produce diarrhea in humans and animals. Rather than a secretory diarrhea as above, they simply destroy the intestinal cells where they attach. Diarrhea still results, but it creates more damage to the intestinal lining. EnterohemorrhagicE. coliis similar to enteropathogenicE. colibut with more associated inflammation. This type does not seem to be a problem for small animals though they can carry it asymptomatically. It would seem that antibiotics would be the obvious treatment for a bacterial disease, yet forE. coliit is surprisingly controversial. It seems that the use of antibiotics can enhance the synthesis of toxins by these bacteria; plus, oftentimes, antibiotic use only serves to makeE. colimore resistant in the GI tract. Antibiotics are generally reserved for those animals (or people) who seem the most sick or who have evidence of bacterial invasion in the bloodstream. Basically, treatment is supportive care until the patient's immune system regains the upper hand. In Conclusion Bacterial diarrheas are an especially serious consideration in the very young and in the weak or compromised, be they human or non-human. It is not unusual for apparently healthy animals to carry these organisms and shed them into the environment and feeding raw foods greatly increases the risk of this kind of latent infection. If you are considering raw food diets, especially if someone in the home is very young or has a compromised immunity, discuss prevention of these infections with your veterinarian.

Category: Cholangitis (Cholangiohepatitis) in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Cholangitis and is it Different from Cholangiohepatitis? The word cholangiohepatitis breaks down into “chol” (bile), “angio” (vessel),hepat(liver), and “itis” (inflammation). Putting this all together means inflammation of the liver and bile ducts. Recently, it has been determined that the term cholangiohepatitis should probably be replaced by cholangitis because, in cats, inflammation in the liver itself, separate from the bile system is not consistently found. Still, the term cholangiohepatitis has been used for years and will probably continue to be used. Your veterinarian may use either or both terms interchangeably. You have probably heard of bile ducts but may not really be sure what bile is all about. Bile is a greenish material the liver makes and transports to the gall bladder via small bile ducts. The gall bladder is a small greenish sac about the size of a superball where bile is stored. When the appropriate hormonal signals are present, the gall bladder contracts and squirts bile into the small intestine via one very large duct called the common bile duct. Bile has several functions. It emulsifies the fat in our diets so that we can absorb it into our bodies. It also serves as a medium to bind toxins that the liver has processed so they can be expelled into the intestine and defecated away. This system is fine but problems can occur when the bacteria living in the small intestine venture up the bile duct and invade the liver, which is normally sterile (free of bacteria). Inflammation results and the liver can fail. This kind of bile duct inflammation is what cholangitis is. What is the Connection Between Cholangitis,  Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and Pancreatitis?   In one study, 80 percent of cats with cholangiohepatitis also hadinflammatory bowel diseaseand 50 percent also hadpancreatitis. Feline anatomy is a little different from that in other species. In cats, the pancreatic duct, which delivers digestive enzymes to the intestine, opens into the same pore as the common bile duct. This means that if bacteria invade the doorway, both the liver and pancreas are at risk for infection.  In other species, each duct has a separate opening. Inflammatory bowel disease involves infiltration of the intestinal lining with cells of inflammation. Absorption of nutrients becomes altered which in turn alters the populations of bacteria living in the intestine. An overgrowth of bacteria can occur or more aggressive species of bacteria can take over the area. It is easy to see how the bile duct can become invaded. This combination of cholangitis (particularly the acute neutrophilic form), inflammatory bowel disease, and pancreatitis is often referred to as triaditis. Often, the patient does not recover until all three conditions are addressed. The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) organized a classification system for liver disease and defined several categories of cholangitis: A liver biopsy can generally distinguish all of these conditions. Neutrophilic Cholangitis and Triaditis The average cat with this condition is a young adult male with a fairly sudden onset of vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, and listlessness. Often there is a fever and abdominal pain. Blood tests are typical of inflammation and liver disease with elevated liver enzymes, white blood cell count, and bilirubin. Ultrasound often shows distended bile ducts and sometimes small gallstones. Treatment A cat with liver failure will require hospitalization, fluid therapy, and some kind of nutritional support (tube feeding, syringe feeding of a liquid diet, or whatever is necessary) regardless of the cause of the liver disease. AntibioticsAntibiotics are helpful in any liver failure case as they help reduce the intestinal bacterial populations (any noxious substances they produce are normally detoxified by the healthy liver, but a sick liver will not be so efficient). Antibiotics also clear the liver of invading bacteria, which is what cholangitis is all about. If possible, the gall bladder should be cultured before starting antibiotics so that the correct antibiotic can be selected. CholereticsA choleretic is a medication that makes bile more liquid so that it can flow smoothly without sludging. The flow of bile in the proper direction helps remove not only the toxins the liver is trying to remove in bile but also helps prevent bacteria from swimming upstream towards the liver tissue. The chief choleretic prescribed for animals isUrsodiol. A cat may well be on this medication for life after an episode of cholangiohepatitis. SAMeThis nutritional medicine has gained tremendous popularity in therapy for all liver diseases and should probably not be left out here. SAMe stands for S-adenosylmethionine. It has several desirable functions but mostly it is an antioxidant, protecting the sick liver cells from the toxins they have absorbed and normally would be excreted in bile. SilymarinThis is the active ingredient in the herbal medication commonly known as milk thistle. It has been shown to be protective to the liver inAmanitamushroom poisoning and many have extrapolated that it should be protective of the liver in other toxic scenarios. It is prescribed for cats with cholangiohepatitis. Most cats begin to show great improvement within one week of beginning proper therapy. Lymphocytic Cholangitis In time, the acute disease described above will progress into a chronic disease that is called lymphocytic-plasmacytic cholangitis. Scarring begins to complicate the disease. Affected cats tend to be older than those with acute disease and tend to show a more waxing/waning disease course over time. Treatment is similar to what is described above, except that immune suppression/anti-inflammatory medication is needed to control the inflammation and minimize the scarring. Often, medication is needed indefinitely or long-term. Immune Suppression This may seem counterproductive for a condition that involves a bacterial infection, but some patients simply cannot get better until their immune system is suppressed. Why is this? For many cats, the problem started with inflammatory bowel disease: infiltration of the intestinal lining with inflammatory cells. Immune suppression is the cornerstone of therapy for this condition. Once the immune reaction is suppressed, the lining of the GI tract regains normal thickness and function, the bacterial bloom subsides, and the invasion of the liver and pancreas ceases. In some cases, immune suppression is simply needed to relieve the inflammation inherent to cholangiohepatitis. Typical medications include prednisone (or prednisolone depending on how severe the liver failure is). More aggressively, chlorambucil, a chemotherapy drug, or cyclosporine, an immune modulator, can be used. Lymphocytic Cholangitis This version of cholangitis is the most chronic, often having been present for years, and involves the heaviest scarring. Persian cats seem predisposed and gamma globulins are almost always highly elevated on the initial blood tests. There is usually no fever and the age group is generally atypical of feline infectious peritonitis, the other condition that commonly causes liver failure and elevated gamma globulins. Treatment is largely the same for chronic neutrophilic cholangitis. Overall, cholangiohepatitis is one of the more treatable liver conditions in cats. This does not mean that every cat will recover; some cats are quite advanced by the time they are first seen by the veterinarian.Pancreatitiscan represent a lethal complication, depending on severity, and lipidosis can occur secondary to cholangitis, creating a more complicated disease picture. The cat that survives the acute episode can expect weeks to months of medication administration and the possibility of relapse or flare-up. The owner should become familiar withinflammatory bowel diseaseand pancreatitis as well. Destructive CholangitisThis form of cholangitis is a more extreme type of lymphocytic cholangitis in which the liver is completely infiltrated with lymphocytes and there is scarring. When the disease has gotten this extreme, it has become quite difficult to treat. At this point, bile ducts have been destroyed, and the entire liver may be involved. A chemotherapy protocol using methotrexate has been proposed by Cornell University. Chronic Cholangitis Associated with Liver Flukes A fluke is a disgusting creature similar to a worm. There are numerous parasitic flukes that can infect cats. Platynosomum flukesFluke eggs are consumed by land snails. The snails shed embryonic baby flukes in their snail poop. A crustacean (like crayfish or similar shelled water creature) will eat the baby fluke. A lizard will eat the crustacean and a cat will eat the lizard. This infection has been referred to as lizard poisoning for this reason. In tropical areas, up to 80 percent of free-roaming cats can be infected. Opisthochiidae flukesFluke eggs are consumed by water snails who shed embryonic baby flukes into the water. The young flukes attack certain types of fish, penetrate the fish skin, and continue their growth inside the fish. Cats (and potentially people) become infected by eating raw or undercooked fish. Inside the cat's body, flukes live inside the gall bladder, creating inflammation and disease. How sick the cat becomes depends on how many flukes there are and how much inflammation is generated. Treatment - Flukes The good news is that flukes are killed bypraziquantel, the same medication used to treat commontapeworminfections. Fluke-associated cholangitis is a curable disease. How Do You Know Which Form is Present? The first step is generally a diagnostic ultrasound to evaluate the texture of the liver and the structure of the bile duct system. The gall bladder is evaluated to see if the bile inside looks all gooey rather than fluid. The bile ducts are evaluated for dilation and whether they are twisted. The intestine and pancreas are also imaged so as to put a picture together of all three organ systems. This may be enough information to begin therapy, but sometimes a biopsy of the liver is needed, especially if one of the more chronic forms is suspected. Once there is tissue sampled, it is easier to determine the category of cholangitis present. Cats frequently require supportive care in the hospital until their appetite returns and nausea is controlled. Recovery depends on concurrent conditions and how severe and long-standing the cholangitis is.

Category: Cholangitis and Cholangiohepatitis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Diseases associated with the liver, gallbladder, and/or bile duct system can be confusing for pet owners because these diseases can have really vague symptoms. It’s not always clear why they happen, and the terminology used to describe them tends to sound like a foreign language. Cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis, the second most common type of liver disease seen in cats, is a prime example. This disease is sometimes referred to as cholangitis, sometimes cholangiohepatitis, and sometimes cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis syndrome. In addition to these names, several different forms of the disease exist, which all have their own names. To add to the confusion, sometimes other diseases can occur at the same time as cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis, which makes figuring out the cause for the symptoms and diagnosing the problem pretty difficult. Helpful Definitions Cholangitis means inflammation of the biliary tree (also called the biliary tract or bile duct system), which connects the gallbladder and liver and helps these organs make, process, store, and secrete bile. Bile is used to break down fat from food in the intestines. Cholangiohepatitis means inflammation of the biliary tree as well as the surrounding liver cells. Cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis can be caused by bacterial infection, in which case the disease may be called neutrophilic cholangitis. It can also be caused by a parasite known as a liver fluke, which causes inflammation after it invades the liver. Another type is called lymphocytic cholangitis. It is associated with lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell involved with the immune system, and it likely occurs because of an overreaction by the immune system. Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, andinflammatory bowel disease, an immune-mediated condition associated with inflammation, poor digestion, and poor absorption of nutrients within the gastrointestinal tract are common conditions that occur in cats that develop cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis. Veterinary scientists don’t know exactly why these diseases happen together, but over 50% of cats have one or both of these diseases in addition to cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis. Clinical Signs and Symptoms Depending on what type of cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis a cat has, the symptoms may occur slowly, over a long period of time (chronic) or happen suddenly (acute). Common signs include poor appetite, throwing up, diarrhea, acting tired, drinking and urinating a lot, fever, weight loss, belly pain, swollen belly, and a yellow tinge (jaundice) to the skin, gums, and eyes may be seen. Diagnosing Cholangitis/Cholangiohepatitis Lab tests will be run on the cat’s blood to see how the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are handling the disease. This type of test is called acomplete blood countor CBC. A chemistry lab test will also be run, which will show the disease’s effects on the liver as well as other organs. Findings that point towards cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis include high liver enzymes. Increased levels of bilirubin, which is a product of the breakdown of red blood cells by the liver, can also be seen. At high levels, bilirubin can cause jaundice (yellow-tinged skin, eyes, and gums). Other tests include abdominal x-rays and ultrasound to examine the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tree. Ultrasound can also be used to sample the bile to check for and culture bacteria. Finally, to officially diagnose cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis, biopsies of the liver tissue are needed. These can occasionally be done with abdominal ultrasound, but often surgery is needed to get large enough pieces of diseased tissues for a pathologist to properly examine. Treatment Treatment may depend on the cause or reason for the cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis (e.g. immune-mediated vs. bacterial infection). If the cat has pancreatitis or inflammatory bowel disease, those will require treatment as well. Antibiotics are commonly used although they may be switched to different kinds depending on the bile culture results. Antibiotics are usually needed for at least 1-2 months and should be continued even once the pet starts feeling better. Steroids to suppress the immune system may be needed. Supplements or medications to help support the liver and biliary tree may also be prescribed, includingursodiol, vitamin E, andSAMe.Do not start any supplements without consulting your vet. In addition to medications, very sick cats may need hospitalization, IV fluids, afeeding tube, and/or surgery to remove the gallbladder. Surgery is usually only needed if an obstruction or blockage occurs within the biliary tree/bile ducts. Prognosis, or chance for improvement, varies depending on the cause. Cats with acute neutrophilic cholangitis, which is a sudden onset bacterial infection of the biliary tree, usually recover. Those with chronic or long-term forms, or lymphocytic forms of cholangitis, tend to respond poorly to medications and the disease can worsen over time to the point of liver failure. If you suspect your cat has a form of cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis, or you have questions about the disease, call your veterinarian for further information.

Category: Giardia in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English See the article summary below. What areGiardia? Giardiaare single-celled organisms, infectious to many types of animals (including humans) all over the world. As you can see in the above image,Giardiaorganisms have little whip-like tentacles called flagella that classify them as flagellates. They use their flagella to move around from place to place, but when they find a spot where they wish to stay (like a cozy nook in the host's intestine), they use a suction cup-like structure (visible in the image) to attach. Their presence in the host intestine can cause diarrhea, though some hosts are symptom-free carriers. Different types ofGiardiainfect different types of animals; it is rare forGiardiafrom apet to transmit to a human; furthermore, dog and catGiardiaspecies are separate and are unlikely to cross from dog to cat or vice versa. Giardia have two forms: the trophozoite and the cyst. The trophozoite is the form that lives within the host, swimming around and attaching with its suction cup. The cyst, however, is the form that lives out in the environment. Trophozoites round up to cysts as they approach the colon and then are passed in feces. Trophozoites that don't round up into cysts and form a shell prior to passing into the cold, cruel world cannot withstand the temperature/moisture variability of the outside world. Cysts are the contagious stage. Trophozoites are in the parasitic stage. Life as aGiardiaOrganism As mentioned, trophozoites and cysts may be passed in fresh feces, but only the hard-shelled little cysts can withstand the conditions of the outside world. The cysts live in the environment (outside the host's body) potentially for months until they are consumed by a host. Inside the host, the cyst's shell is digested away, releasing two trophozoites into the intestine, and the cycle begins again. Contaminated water is the classical source of aGiardiainfection. When a fecal sample is analyzed, the appearance of theGiardiaorganism depends on whether the sample is freshly obtained or if it has been outside of the host's body for a while.Giardiaorganisms begin to round up into cysts in a matter of hours. The active trophozoites rather look like funny faces with the two nuclei forming the eyes and median bodies forming the mouth. Cysts look a bit more generic. In the environment, cysts survive in water and soil as long as it is relatively cool and wet. A host animal will accidentally swallow a cyst when drinking from a puddle, or toilet, or when licking fur. After the cyst has been swallowed, the cyst's shell is digested away, freeing the two trophozoites that go forth and attach to the intestinal lining. As mentioned, the trophozoitewill swim to a spot using its flagella and attach with its suction cup (more correctly called its "ventral disc").Trophozoitestend to live in different intestinal areas in different host species but will move to other areas depending on the diet the host is eating. Thetrophozoitemay round itself up and form a cyst while still inside the host's body. If the host has diarrhea, bothtrophozoitesand cysts may be shed in diarrhea; either form can be found in fresh stool. After infection, it takes 5 to 12 days in dogs or 5 to 16 days in cats forGiardiato be found in the host’s stool. Diarrhea can precede the shedding of theGiardia. Infection is more common in kennel situations where animals are housed in groups. How DoesGiardiaCause Diarrhea? No one is completely sure, but infection seems to cause problems with normal intestinal absorption of vitamins and other nutrients. Diarrhea is generally not bloody with aGiardiainfection. Immune-suppressive medications, such as corticosteroids, can re-activate an oldGiardiainfection. We do not know why some infected hosts get diarrhea while others never do. Diagnosis In the past, diagnosis was difficult. The stool sample being examined needed to be fresh, plusGiardiararely show up on the usual fecal testing methods used to detect other parasites. Several tricks have been developed to makeGiardiaeasier to find (special stains, using special processing solutions, etc.), but what has made the biggest difference in the diagnosis ofGiardiais the ELISA test kit, which is similar in format to a home pregnancy test. This method has dramatically improved the ability to detectGiardiainfections and the test can be completed in just a few minutes while you wait. Giardiashed organisms intermittently and may be difficult to detect. Sometimes pets must be retested in order to find an infection, and asymptomatic carrier animals are common. It should also be mentioned that the ELISA test can remain positive for some time after the infection has been eradicated so if re-testing is desired after a positive test, another test format may be more helpful than the ELISA test kit. Treatment A broad-spectrum dewormer calledfenbendazole(Panacur®) seems to be the most reliable treatment at this time.Metronidazole(Flagyl®) has been a classical treatment forGiardiabut studies show it to only be effective in 67% of cases. For some resistant cases, both medications are used concurrently. Febantel is also commonly used forGiardiaas it is converted to fenbendazole in the body. Because cysts can stick to the fur of the infected patient and be a source for re-infection, the positive animal should receive a bath at least once in the course of treatment. At the least, the patient should have a bath at the end of treatment, plus it is especially important to promptly remove infected fecal matter to minimize environmental contamination. Can Humans Be Infected? The short answer is only rarely, so the concern is pretty low in general. However, maintain good hygiene practices such as regular hand-washing and removing fresh pet fecal matter promptly, as mentioned. That said, here is a more detailed answer:Giardia duodenalisis classified into several subcategories called assemblages and designated A through G. Some assemblages are specific as to which host animals they can infect, and other assemblages are not so picky. Assemblage F, for example, only infects cats, and assemblages C and D only infect dogs but assemblage A will infect dogs, cats, people, rodents, wild mammals, and cattle. Common testing methods do not indicate what assemblage has been detected, so there is always a possibility of human transmission as long as the assemblage is unknown. Environmental Decontamination Giardiacysts are killed in the environment by freezing temperatures and by direct sunlight. If neither of these is practical for the area to be disinfected, a chemical disinfectant will be needed. Organic matter such as dirt or stool is protective of the cyst, so on a concrete surface, do basic cleaning before disinfecting. Quaternary ammonia compounds can be used to killGiardiacysts. Animals should be thoroughly bathed before being reintroduced into a clean area. A properly chlorinated swimming pool should not be able to become contaminated. As for areas with lawns or plants, decontamination will not be possible without killing the plants and allowing the area to dry out in direct sunlight. A Footnote on Vaccination A vaccine againstGiardiawas previously available, not to prevent infection in a vaccinated pet but to reduce the shedding of cysts by the vaccinated patient. In other words, the vaccine was designed to reduce the contamination of a kennel whereGiardiawas expected to be a problem. This would be helpful during an outbreak in a shelter or rescue situation but is not particularly helpful to the average dog whose owner wants to simply prevent infection. Because of the limited usefulness of the vaccine, manufacturing was discontinued in 2009. In Summary: Additional information from the Companion Animal Parasite Counsel (CAPC): DrontalPlus® is effective in treating Giardia in dogs when administered per label directions. CAPC Board majority opinion is that asymptomatic dogs may not require treatment.

Category: Hairballs (Trichobezoars) In Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English "He's throwing up hairballs all the time. I'm tired of stepping on slimy hair." To the client, the problem may be simple. But to the veterinarian, it's much more complicated. When cats groom themselves and their feline friends, hair gets caught on the barbs of the tongue. That hair then is swallowed. In a "healthy" cat, that hair will go through the stomach and intestines (gastrointestinal tract) and come out in the feces. So, if a cat is throwing up or regurgitating hairballs, there is more going on than most owners realize. Grooming Grooming allows cats to keep themselves clean. They remove old hair, surface dirt, and foreign bodies when they groom themselves and other cats. But if a cat is long-haired, he has more hair to remove. (Mother Nature designed felines with short hair. Life is easier for wild cats when they have short hair.) So, long-haired cats who have to do all the grooming themselves -- who aren't being groomed (brushed) by their owners -- are ingesting more hair than Mother Nature planned. The elimination of the extra hair may be too much for a healthy long-haired cat's digestive system. Also, if grooming becomes excessive, then more hair is entering the digestive tract, whether the cat is a short-haired or a long-haired cat. Over-grooming can occur when a cat is stressed. Anxiety, emotional stress, etc., can cause a cat to groom himself more often and for longer times. It's a coping mechanism, like the same way many children suck their thumbs to seek solace. Over-grooming can also occur in cats experiencing pain. They may lick and groom the painful area to try to make it "feel better" and/or to reduce the stress. Urinary tract pain, musculoskeletal pain, and abdominal pain may cause over-grooming by the unhappy cat. But hairballs also occur in animals who aren't "putting too much hair" into their digestive tracts. What Are Other Potential Causes? If the stomach and small intestine don't allow the ingested hair to move through normally, the cat will produce hairballs. If the cat has inflammatory bowel disease, hair - and food - won't pass through it at a normal speed, or at all. The stomach and intestinal tissue is damaged and doesn't provide normal motility. It also doesn't produce the normal digestive enzymes or lubricants that allow the intestinal contents to move along. The same is true of gastrointestinal cancer. The contents of the tract (hair and food) don't move along the way they should. To find the more specific causes of hairballs, your veterinarian may need to explore various body systems and consider conditions that may lead to hairballs. This may include megaesophagus, diaphragmatic hernia, gastrointestinal neoplasia, ileus, intestinal parasites, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, cystitis, bladder stones, kidney stones, arthritis, boredom, frustration, skin parasites, fungal skin diseases, and more. This is not quite as simple as the problem the client discussed. Diagnostic Tests Your veterinarian may recommend tests to look for causes of hairballs including a complete blood count, blood chemical analysis, fecal examination, urinalysis, ultrasonography, radiography, contrast radiography, skin cytology, histopathology, behavior evaluation, etc. Finding and treating the primary problem is always preferable to just treating the symptom (hairballs). The cat and the client will be happier if everything can be put back to normal. In addition to treating the inciting problem, the veterinarian may recommend diet changes, more brushing by the owner, more play time with the owner, etc. With diagnostic skills and a little luck, the veterinarian can make the owner happier and the cat healthier and more content.

Category: Hepatic Lipidosis (Fatty Liver Disease) in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Owners of cats that have been diagnosed with fatty liver disease or for whom fatty liver is being considered can use some information. Briefly, lipidosis (the medical name for "fatty liver") is a cause or contributing cause of liver failure when a cat that was once overweight loses weight too quickly. Often, the owner is not aware that this is dangerous and is pleased to see an obese cat trimming down. By the time the cat actually stops eating and is clearly sick, the disease is well underway and will require more aggressive support to try and reverse it. The positive news is that there is a good recovery rate for this condition, provided it has not progressed too far. Unexplained weight loss is never good.Have your cat evaluated before they become overtly sick. The average cat with lipidosis is middle-aged, was at one time obese but has lost at least 25% of its original body weight, has a poor appetite, and may have an obvious upset stomach (38% will have vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation). Cats that are especially weak may also have electrolyte imbalances or vitamin deficiencies from their liver disease. In lipidosis, there is frequently a bleeding tendency that can make obtaining a biopsy sample somewhat risky. If ultrasound is suggestive of lipidosis, it is generally safer to take a needle aspirate rather thana biopsy sample, which is a bigger bite of tissue. An aspirate showing fat infiltration is usually diagnostic, especially when ultrasound shows the entire liver has a fatty texture. A Cat in Liver Failure The cat in liver failure is jaundiced (meaning their flesh is developing a yellow tinge), frequently nauseated, will not eat, and generally is an obviously ill animal.  The jaundice (clinically termed icterus) is often not noticed by pet owners but can be seen by carefully examining the whites of the eyes for a yellowish color. Sometimes, the yellow is not evident to the naked eye, but the trouble is picked up as a blood test elevation in bilirubin, a yellow pigment normally kept in check by the liver. Alternatively, an icteric cat's urine will look bright orange or even brown as bilirubin builds up. If the bilirubin is not elevated, liver disease may be picked up as an elevation in a blood test enzyme called alkaline phosphatase (ALP). This enzyme should never be elevated in cats under any normal circumstances, though there are several forms of this enzyme, and an elevation does not necessarily indicate liver disease. An ALP elevation suggests liver disease and, if there is no obvious alternative explanation for ALP increase, it requires follow-up testing such as a “bile acids” liver function test and/or imaging of the liver, such as an ultrasound. Other liver enzymes commonly monitored on routine blood panels are alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). These enzymes may increase relatively easily and are not as important in liver evaluation as ALP elevations, but a substantial increase may also warrant follow-up liver testing. In the event of hepatic lipidosis, also called fatty liver, the elevation in ALP is often dramatic. Liver Disease Vs. Liver Failure It is important to distinguish tests of liver damage (like enzymes) versus tests of liver function (like bile acids). The enzymes ALT and AST are normally held inside liver cells; when their presence is detected free in the bloodstream, this is an indicator of liver cell death. A liver can have damage without any decrease in overall liver overall function. A liver function test is different. Here, the liver is actually asked to do something (generally process a biochemical in a detectable way). In this way, we can see if the liver actually needs support and whether or not we have a good chance of getting a diagnosis through a biopsy. Tissue sampling, such as a biopsy or a needle aspirate, is crucial to diagnosing liver disease. Without a tissue sample, all we can tell is whether or not the liver is in failure, and specific therapy for a specific type of liver disease is not possible (though general support of the failing liver may still be possible.) A typical pathway for diagnosis of this condition would be: Fatty Liver (Hepatic Lipidosis) A fatty liver can develop in as soon as two weeks with an appetite reduction of 50-75%. The so-called fatty liver is one of the most common causes of liver failure in cats and it stems from the cat's natural history. Cats evolved as predators of small birds and rodents, eating multiple small meals throughout the day. Their physiology is geared towards a completely carnivorous diet and with the assumption that cats would live lean and never have the opportunity to develop extensive fat stores. Of course, this all changed when cats became domesticated. The modern housecat has every opportunity to become overweight, and while this may not be of disastrous consequence on a day to day basis, should the cat get sick and stop eating or get accidentally lost or confined where food is unavailable, a significant problem erupts. The fat stores mobilize. Normally, in starvation, fat is moved from the body's storage depots to the liver for processing into lipoproteins, but the feline liver has not evolved to handle huge amounts of mobilized fat. The liver becomes infiltrated with fat and fails. Complicating matters is the high dietary protein requirement unique to cats; protein malnutrition develops very fast when cats do not eat. Why Would a Cat Stop Eating in the First Place? Initially, there is an underlying cause of the decrease in eating that leads cats down the slippery slope to lipidosis. If you’re lucky, the underlying cause has resolved (such as the cat was lost/starved and has now been found). It is important to keep in mind that even though lipidosis usually carries a fair prognosis, in more than 90% of cases, there is a second condition that requires attention, one with a prognosis that might not be so fair. Cornell University looked at 157 cats with lipidosis and looked at what conditions were primary. Here is a summary of what they found: A lab test that might be helpful in determining the underlying cause is the GGT (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) level. It is usually not elevated in lipidosis but would be elevated if there is an underlying additional liver disease or in the event of pancreatitis.  Treatment The cornerstone of treatment for lipidosis involves aggressive nutritional support. The diet for a cat with lipidosis should be high protein/low carbohydrate. Ideally, 35-45% of the diet's metabolizable energy should be protein to reverse the metabolic state of the disease. Most feline recovery formulas will meet this requirement, as will diets made to manage feline diabetes. Your veterinarian will select an appropriate food based on how the food will be delivered to your cat as well as its nutritional composition.If this is done carefully, the recovery rate approaches 90%. Generally, by the time a cat has gotten into trouble with hepatic lipidosis, most owners have already tried tempting them with assorted favorite foods and gotten no results. At the point where lipidosis has developed, your cat should not be given a choice about eating; there are several methods of providing food. Nasogastric Tube A feeding tube can be passed through the nose, down the esophagus, and sewn into place to allow feeding of a liquid diet. Placing this kind of tube does not require anesthesia, and the tube is relatively easy to use. Some problems are associated with this type of feeding tube. For example, the tube can be dislodged by an errant paw, necessitating replacement; an Elizabethan collar is necessary to protect the feeding tube. Furthermore, only liquid diets can be given through the tube due to its small diameter. The tube can also be pushed backward after a vomiting attempt so that it opens towards the mouth instead of the stomach. All of these problems make the N-G tube the least popular of all the feeding tubes when it comes to long-term use; however, often this form of feeding is used for the first few days as this is when bleeding risk is highest and the patient is least stable for anesthesia. One of the other tubes can be placed when the patient is more stable. Esophagostomy or Pharyngostomy Tube Theesophagostomyor pharyngostomy tube is easily placed with short-acting anesthesia and sewn in place, creating a feeding tube that exits the side of the neck. A bandage or padded collar is placed to hold the tube in position and keep it from catching on things, though the tube is comfortable enough that an Elizabethan collar (plastic cone collar) is not necessary. The cat can be mobile with comfort, and the diet can be slurried or blenderized as the tube is larger than the nasogastric feeding tube. The tube must stay in place for at least two weeks but can stay in place for many months if necessary. The tube does not interfere with eating normally when the cat recovers food interest. Stomach Tube/PEG Tube A gastrostomy tube is placed under anesthesia and protrudes from the side of the body. The tube connects directly to the stomach and similarly allows for blenderized food to be delivered. Placement is a bit more invasive than esophagostomy and requires specific equipment but is another way to feed a sick cat. A bandage covers the tube and the cat is generally comfortable; an Elizabethan collar is not necessary. Be sure the food you are using is made for cats.Human liquid diets may be deficient in some of the specific amino acids required by cats for recovery. The diet for a cat with lipidosis should be high protein/low carbohydrate. Ideally, 35-45% of the diet's metabolizable energy should be protein to reverse the metabolic state of the disease. Most feline recovery formulas will meet this requirement, as will diets made for managing feline diabetes. Your veterinarian will select an appropriate food based on how the food will be delivered to the cat as well as its nutritional composition. Assisted Feeding This method is generally discouraged as it can be so distasteful for the cat and can create food aversion where the cat no longer wishes to eat normally, even after recovery, because of bad association with the necessary manipulations. Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions. Rules for Overall Nutritional Support General Liver Support There are several general therapeutic treatments that are supportive to the liver that might be used. A low red blood cell count is a common complication of lipidosis and may be caused by Vitamin K-related bleeding/clotting issues, inadequate blood phosphorus leading to red blood cell rupture, or precipitation of abnormal hemoglobin within the red blood cell (Heinz body anemia). There is approximately a one in four chance that a lipidosis cat will need some kind of blood transfusion before leaving the hospital. Refeeding Injury When a patient has been in a starvation state for a while and then begins to eat, some serious metabolic problems may occur in the first few days as the metabolism changes. When food is eaten, the pancreas releases insulin in an attempt to store the calories. Unfortunately, insulin also drives circulating potassium inside cells, and cats with hepatic lipidosis are often depleted of potassium to start. This sudden drop in potassium can make a cat quite weak (causing a drooping neck, listlessness, urine retention/inability to urinate normally, heart muscle depression, and more). Insulin will drive phosphate into cells similarly, leaving the bloodstream depleted. Red blood cells will not have enough phosphate to maintain their own structure; they burst, causing severe anemia. If the blood phosphate level drops below 2.2 mg/dl, an IV supplement will be needed. After the phosphate level starts to rise, an oral supplement of phosphate is given (usually lactose-free cow's milk works well). Expect your cat to be monitored in the hospital for the first three days following initiation of nutritional support, and possibly longer. Refeeding injuries can be usually avoided by starting with half (or less) of the required amount of calories and gradually working up to the full nutritional requirement over a few days. Having a low blood potassium level at the time of lipidosis diagnosis is associated with an increased chance of death. If there is one lesson to learn from this article, it is that survival and recovery from hepatic lipidosis approaches 90% with nutritional support. Without aggressive nutritional support, most cats will die. Many people are reluctant to place or work with feeding tubes and want to try feeding their cat at home. There is no room for tentative treatment when it comes to this disease. Cats that show a 50% drop in their total bilirubin level within 7 - 10 days are statistically likely to survive. Keep in mind that hepatic lipidosis generally does not spontaneously happen. If there is an underlying cause, it must also be addressed.

Category: Hepatic Lipidosis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hepatic lipidosis is a life-threatening liver disease that happens in cats and sometimes dogs. It is also called fatty liver disease or fatty liver syndrome, and it is the most common liver disease seen in cats in North America. It is caused by a buildup of fat (lipid) inside liver cells (also called hepatocytes). This buildup prevents liver cells from working normally, which can lead to liver failure. What Causes Hepatic Lipidosis? When cats stop eating for a while for whatever reason, their stored fat is broken down into fatty acids. These fatty acids are used for energy instead of the usual glucose they get from food. High levels of fatty acids in the blood eventually lead to a buildup of lipid, typically triglycerides, in liver cells faster than the cells can get rid of it. Compared to normal liver cells, fat-filled liver cells don’t function well. They can become swollen to the point that they squeeze important liver structures such as the bile ducts, which can slow or stop normal bile flow (a condition known as cholestasis). Pretty much anything that can cause a cat to quit eating can cause hepatic lipidosis, usually with 2 days to 1 week. It is especially common in obese cats who quit eating suddenly. Gastrointestinal (GI) disease is a common cause. This includes any set of GI problems associated with throwing up, tummy pain, and/or loose stool, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Pancreatitisandgallbladder disease(also known as cholangitis) also commonly lead to hepatic lipidosis. Other potential causes includediabetes, liver disease (e.g. hepatotoxicity), starvation, and cancer. In roughly 30% of cats, the cause for this extreme hepatocyte fat buildup remains a mystery. In such cases, it’s called idiopathic hepatic lipidosis. What Does Hepatic Lipidosis Look Like? Sudden and extreme weight loss is common, with some cats losing half their body weight in a short period of time. Poor or no appetite; weakness; throwing up/vomiting; loose stool/diarrhea; trouble pooping or constipation; and/or a yellow tinge to the skin, whites of the eyes, and gums may also be seen. Your veterinarian will run blood tests, such as acomplete blood count/CBCand biochemistry profile, to check the red and white blood cells for anemia and signs of inflammation. The tests will also assess the liver and determine if there are any electrolyte imbalances. These tests can help narrow down the cause of hepatic lipidosis. Additional tests may be needed to understand the severity of disease and better pinpoint the primary cause. Bile acids tests will help the veterinarian understand how well the liver is working. Abdominal ultrasound offers a view of the organs in the belly such as the liver, gallbladder, intestines, and pancreas. In some cases, a biopsy is needed for diagnosis as well. Treatment Almost all cats with hepatic lipidosis need to be hospitalized. They get dehydrated quite easily and often need a large volume of IV fluids and electrolytes. It can take several days to fully rehydrate a dehydrated cat. The primary disease that caused the problem also needs to be addressed and treated, but how and for what length of time will depend on that particular disease. In order to get noneating cats the nutrition they need, even when they don’t feel like eating, afeeding tubecan be surgically placed and make everybody's life easier. This can be done either in their neck, with an esophagostomy tube, or in their belly, with a gastrostomy tube. While feeding tubes may sound a little scary, the procedure to insert them doesn’t cause much discomfort, and getting enough nutrition to a sick cat will vastly improve their chances for recovery. Other treatments include medications for appetite stimulation (e.g.mirtazapine, cyproheptidine), nausea (e.g.metoclopramide,Cerenia®), liver protection (e.g.SAMe,Denamarin®), and/or diarrhea (e.g. probiotics, metronidazole). Such treatments will depend on what caused the problem and how sick the cat is. The good news is that most cats given intense treatment early in the disease process usually recover just fine. Unfortunately, sometimes the primary disease that caused hepatic lipidosis an be difficult to treat, such as with severe pancreatitis. In those situations, chances for recovery are much lower. Your veterinarian will be able to give you an idea of your kitty’s outcome based on the ongoing diseases, signs, and symptoms. If you suspect your cat has developed hepatic lipidosis, call your veterinarian’s office as soon as you can. Remember, the sooner treatment is started, the better the outcome.

Category: Infiltrative Bowel Disease in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What Does this Mean? The small intestinal tract is a remarkable organ. It has to neutralize acid from the stomach, apply digestive enzymes and emollients, absorb and conduct away the microscopic nutrients, and move its contents from one end of our body to the other. There is also immunological reactivity, hormonal activity and response, and the matter of housing a variety of bacteria without allowing them to access the interior of our bodies. Its layers act as both a barrier and gateway, plus it must have muscle strength for tone and motion. Proper function depends in part on normal thickness of all the delicate layers. Diseases of Infiltration Disease can lead to an influx of inappropriate cells into the layers of the intestine. This infiltration of the bowel by abnormal cells creates thickening and puffiness, which hampers function. The thick intestine does not contract properly, which leads to food pooling and sludging. Pooling and sludging leads to the sensation of nausea and malaise. The thick intestine also cannot absorb nutrients properly, which leads to weight loss and diarrhea. Frequently there is ulceration and bleeding as the membranes become unhealthy. Dysbiosis Bacterial populations become altered when the nutrients available to them changes in composition.  In other words, what sort of bacteria live in the bowel depends on what nutrients are in abundance around them. Different nutrients promote different bacterial populations for better or worse. Abnormal nutrient absorption can lead to an overgrowth of bacteria or at least an alteration in the proportions of different populations of bacteria, creating a bad neighborhood in the bowel. Toxic bacterial products can be produced. Bacteria can over-power natural barriers, allowing them to crawl up the pancreatic duct or bile duct where they create inflammation in organs that are normally sterile (pancreas and liver). Obviously, none of this is a good thing. Fixing it Depends on Knowing the Nature of the Infiltration There are two common diseases that involve infiltration: intestinal lymphoma and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Both diseases involve lymphocytes infiltrating the delicate bowel. In lymphoma, these are malignant cancerous lymphocytes. In the case of IBD, they are active lymphocytes reacting inappropriately to an immunological trigger (such as a food or bacterial waste product).  A biopsy is necessary to distinguish these two diseases and distinguishing the two conditions allows for the most effective treatment. Treating LymphomaThere are two forms oflymphoma: small cell and large cell. The small cell form is associated with a rapid and sustained response to therapy with remissions of one year or longer being common. The large cell form is nearly untreatable with remissions being unreliable or short in duration. A biopsy will determine which type a cat has. Confirmation of lymphoma also allows for a more tailored protocol so as to maximize the quality of remission. Treating Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseIBD is an immune-mediated disease and treatment centers on suppressing the inappropriate immunological response so that the bowel can recover. Specific diets may be employed to minimize inappropriate reactions to food in long-term management. It is theoretically possible, eventually, to recover from this disease completely, though most patients need long-term medications to control the inflammation. The possibly good news here is that because both conditions involve lymphocyte infiltration, there is a great deal of overlap in therapy so it is possible to make up a treatment plan that will cover both possibilities with a reasonable chance of success. This is not optimal but provides a route to inexpensive therapy. Diagnostics: Start with an Ultrasound The normal diagnostic sequence involves (after basic examination and lab work to rule out metabolic issues) an ultrasound of the belly followed by either endoscopy to obtain intestinal biopsies or exploratory surgery to obtain biopsies. Why not simply skip to the biopsy? It turns out a great deal of information can be obtained by ultrasound. Ultrasound allows for evaluation of tissue not accessible during endoscopy or even surgery. Further, it may even be possible to get the diagnosis without the expense and stress of surgery if tissue can be obtained by ultrasound guidance. That said, there are some caveats to the use of ultrasound as the final diagnostic.  For example, there is a great deal of overlap in bowel thickness between what normal patients have, what IBD patients have, and what lymphoma patients have. Normal patients will not have abnormal layering but sick patients can have completely normal layering. More severe disruptions in layering are more typical of lymphoma, especially when they occur in separate segments, but less severe wall thickness change is not very specific. Diagnostic Considerations with Abdominal Ultrasound Biopsy by Endoscopy or Surgery If ultrasound findings are not specific and the diagnosis remains ambiguous, in a perfect world, referral for endoscopy or even surgery follows, biopsy samples are taken, and a tailored therapy can initiate or at least informed decisions can be made. Not every patient is stable for anesthesia, however, and not every owner is financially able to pursue a specialized procedure. There is controversy about whether full-thickness biopsy samples (which can only be obtained through surgery) are worth the invasiveness of surgical exploration.Endoscopy allows the surface of the bowel to be viewed from the inside of the intestine so that a biopsy sample can be taken from a specific site. Endoscopy is vastly less invasive and the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine has indicated that endoscopy is the preferred method of sampling. As with ultrasound, there is a great deal of overlap in findings between lymphoma and inflammatory bowel disease as both conditions involve lymphocyte infiltration. PCR testing and Immunohistochemistry can be used to distinguish the two conditions once a tissue sample is obtained. (Cancer cells by definition stem from one cell gone cancerous and thus the entire group of lymphocytes involved in the disease will share genetic markers while inflammatory infiltrates come from a group of cells and will show much more genetic variability.) Having a confirmed diagnosis allows for accuracy in prognosis and precision in treatment and may be well worth the expense of this extra step. Treatment When we Are not sure which Condition We're Treating Because there is a great deal of overlap between the treatment for IBD and the treatment for lymphoma, a therapy plan can be designed that covers both possibilities reasonably well. Typically this involves some kind of corticosteroid; possibly some kind of immunosuppressive medication; and possibly a special diet, probiotics, and nutritional supplements.  Response to medication is generally rapid (within a week) for IBD though it can take up to two weeks, and a common lymphoma statistic is that 75% will achieve remission within three weeks regardless of protocol.  Longer remissions can be obtained with more tailored protocols but this way a reasonably priced therapy is possible.

Category: Triaditis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Triaditis is a condition in cats that involves three separate diseases:pancreatitis,cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis, andinflammatory bowel disease(IBD). Veterinary scientists are not sure why this happens to cats, especially because cats can have one disease, such as pancreatitis, without having the other diseases. A bacterial infection in one or more of the associated organs (gastrointestinal/GI tract, pancreas, liver, gallbladder) or an autoimmune process is most likely what initiates the condition. Many scientists suspect that triaditis probably starts with issues in the GI tract that result in IBD, such as an overproduction or imbalance of certain kinds of gut bacteria (known as intestinal dysbiosis) or GI inflammation associated with an abnormal immune reaction in the gut. This then leads to pancreatitis and cholangitis. Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, an organ that produces enzymes to help break down food in the intestinal tract. It can develop suddenly as acute pancreatitis or be a long-term, chronic problem. Cholangitis is inflammation of the gallbladder and bile ducts. When the liver is also inflamed, it is sometimes called cholangiohepatitis. The gallbladder makes bile, which helps break down fatty foods in the intestinal tract. The ducts or passageways for the pancreas and gallbladder open into the intestines in the same place, so when that area of the intestines is inflamed, infected, or diseased, the pancreas and gallbladder have a higher chance of being injured as well. IBD is a chronic condition of the intestines in which inflammation leads to a poorly functioning GI tract. Causes are numerous and include overactivity by the immune system,food allergies, abnormal bacteria in the gut, and genetics. These causes often occur in some combination together. How is Triaditis Diagnosed? In cats with triaditis, the most common sign is vomiting or throwing up. Decreased activity levels, diarrhea or loose stool, poor appetite, and weight loss are also frequently seen. Occasionally, fever, tummy pain, a yellow tinge to the skin (known as icterus), and swelling of the belly may occur. Your veterinarian will want to do a thorough physical examination to assess for other causes of these signs. They will also run tests on your cat’s blood, such as a complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, and pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity test. X-rays and an abdominal ultrasound may also be needed. If a bacterial infection is suspected, a culture and sensitivity may be run on fluid or tissues from the affected organs. These tests help point the veterinarian in the right direction for diagnosing triaditis. However, to get an official diagnosis, biopsies of the pancreas, intestines, gallbladder, and surrounding liver are needed. While this sounds like a lot of tests, keep in mind that triaditis is three different diseases happening at the same time, so it can be difficult to get the diagnosis right. Thank goodness kitties are so tough! Treating Triaditis In order to treat triaditis effectively, all three diseases need to be managed. Pancreatitis treatment may include pain medication, treatment for nausea, and hospitalization and fluid therapy for dehydration. Triaditis treatment is similar, although liver and gallbladder protective medications such asursodiol,samE, orDenamarinmay be used to help encourage healing. Antibiotics may be given if a bacterial infection is diagnosed. IBD treatment includes managing the cause of GI disease, which can involve a special diet, medications to suppress the immune system, and vitamin B supplementation when needed. Additional treatments needed will depend on the complications or effects of triaditis on the pet. Bleeding disorders,gall stones(also known as choleliths), severe infections such asabscessesor septicemia, calcium deficiencies, and electrolyte imbalances are some of the complications that may occur, especially if treatment is delayed. For cats that won’t eat,feeding tubesare sometimesnecessary. Triaditis is a complex disease, but your veterinarian will be able to give you a good idea of what is needed for your cat and help you get them back to health. The prognosis can vary depending on the severity of the disease.  Luckily, many cats with triaditis recover well with treatment. Unfortunately, the condition can return periodically. Be sure to monitor your cat at home for signs of recurrence and let your veterinarian know as soon as possible. The sooner treatment can be started, the more likely your pet will improve quickly.

Category: Umbilical Hernias in Puppies and Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An umbilical hernia is a condition in which abdominal contents (fat, intestines, etc.) protrude past the abdominal wall at the location where the umbilical cord was attached to the fetus. Congenital umbilical hernias are more common in puppies than in kittens. The umbilicus, or belly button, is where the umbilical cord attaches when the puppy or kitten is in the womb. The umbilical cord carries nutrition and oxygen from the mother to the fetus, and waste products and carbon dioxide from the fetus to the mother. Normally, after the puppy or kitten is born, the cord breaks, and the connection at the umbilicus closes up. An umbilical hernia occurs when the hole doesn’t close correctly. When this happens, skin is the only barrier between the abdominal organs and the environment. Umbilical hernias are diagnosed on physical examination. Small hernias do not usually cause any problems, and are often left untreated. Large hernias should be repaired surgically, because there is a risk that the abdominal contents inside the hernia sac could become damaged or strangulated. Strangulation of intestinal loops can cause blood flow restriction to the intestine, intestinal blockage, etc. Strangulated hernias can become life-threatening; signs can include a large, warm hernia sac; vomiting; abdominal pain; lack of appetite; and depression. Radiography or ultrasonography may be necessary to help diagnose a strangulated hernia. As long as the hernia isn’t causing problems for the puppy/kitten, the herniorrhaphy (hernioplasty, hernia repair surgery) can be delayed until the scheduled ovariohysterectomy or neuter. However, if strangulation occurs, the surgery becomes an emergency procedure. The exact cause of congenital umbilical hernias is unknown, but it is generally thought to be a hereditary condition.

Category: Diabetic Cat Diet
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources As most of us know, proper dietary support for diabetes mellitus is very important in overall diabetes management. In cats, diabetes mellitus can actually be reversed; if there has not been too much permanent pancreatic damage, and if blood sugar can be regulated quickly, the cat can become normal. For most diabetic cats, a low carbohydrate/high protein approach is the best route to accomplishing this goal, though the priority is given to maintaining proper body condition and managing diet needs for concurrent medical conditions. Cats become diabetic when they experience sustained high blood sugar levels for too long. Genetics and diet aside, any cat can be made into a diabetic cat by subjecting the cat to repeated intravenous glucose infusions for a long enough time. Too much glucose in the bloodstream over time depletes the pancreas of insulin as the pancreas struggles to control all that sugar day after day. This struggle eventually creates an insulin deficiency, which is basically what diabetes mellitus is. In a more natural setting where repeated intravenous glucose infusions do not occur, the problem is a high carbohydrate diet. When we eat carbohydrates and they enter our bodies, there is a rise in blood sugar levels that persists for several hours. In the cat, it is more like eight to twelve hours, even longer if the cat is obese. This circulating blood sugar stimulates insulin secretion so that all sugar can be stored in the body. If the cat is snacking on dry food throughout the day, he or she may be secreting insulin throughout the day as well. This makes for a fat cat and a depleted pancreas. Over-eating high carbohydrate diets promotes the development of diabetes mellitus and creates obesity. Obesity itself further promotes the development of diabetes mellitus. We have mentioned that a diabetic cat can become normal if blood sugar levels are returned to normal and kept normal for a long enough time. This cannot usually be done without insulin injections, but diet is important as well. We need to minimize the post-meal glucose tide that contributed to the cat's diabetes. One way to do this is to provide few dietary carbohydrates. The body still needs sugars to run its metabolism, but the patient's liver is happy to make them from dietary proteins, and the liver does so without creating any post-meal glucose spikes. This makes for a more even blood sugar level throughout the day and reduces the amount of insulin needed to keep things under control. Sounds great, right? So How Much Carbohydrate Should We be Looking for? The bad news is that the information we are looking for is probably not going to be on the pet food label. We are going to have to look it up on the company website. We are looking for less than 7% of the diet's metabolizable energy as carbohydrates. What does this mean? Let's start with "metabolizable energy." A calorie is a measurement of the energy content in an amount of food. We need this energy to run our bodies. Picture a plate of food. That food is said to have a certain number of calories. If you take the food and incinerate it, the amount of heat it generates is measured in calories. This measurement is the gross energy of the food. This is what is meant when a cookie is said to have 100 calories or a frozen dinner has 300 calories, etc. But these calories are not 100% available for your personal use when you eat that plate of food. Some of that food will end up as fecal matter, and some calories are used in the process of digesting the food. This means that the 100-calorie cookie you eat might only provide your body with 90 calories for your personal use. The gross energy minus the energy that wasn't digested = digestible energy. It turns out there is another level before we are able to use our meal calories. We have to process the fuel/food/calories after they have been absorbed into our bodies. We have to transport them into our cells so they can be used. After all the energy used in processing new fuel/calories is taken into consideration, we are left with metabolizable energy, a common reference in nutrition when evaluating diet. The metabolizable energy is now available to be burned/used, so theoretically, our 100-calorie cookie on the plate has provided us with 80 calories to actually use. It is the metabolizable energy that concerns us because this is the only way to compare the protein, fat, and carbohydrate content of different diets; we have to factor out all the undigestible or unusable material to be able to compare. Values are expressed as "% ME," in other words, the percentage of the total metabolizable energy. OnceAgain,the“MagicNumber”foraDiabeticCat’sDietIsLessThan7%CarbohydrateME.Finding this information is a little tricky as it will not be on the pet food label. If you are lucky, you can go to the manufacturer’s website and find the %ME for fat, carbohydrate, and protein. If it isn't available and you still want to know, there will be math involved. Kibble requires a certain carbohydrate content to be molded and shaped, but canned diets do not have such limitations, which means that this degree of carbohydrate restriction is only possible in a canned diet. There are several therapeutic diets manufactured with carbohydrate restriction fitting the above guideline.  Ask your veterinarian for guidance in selection. If possible, 3-4 small meals should be provided daily, but if this is impractical, then twice daily feedings in conjunction with giving insulin can be provided.There are many cats who simply do not like canned food, and such diabetic cats can most certainly be regulated with carbohydrate-restricted dry foods if necessary, but if possible, they should transition to canned food. Obese Diabetic Cats Obesity makes for difficult diabetic regulation. Weight loss is key and the high protein/low carbohydrate strategy discussed above may have too many calories for an overweight cat. This is where it may be more important to use a different strategy in reducing post-feeding glucose tides. Instead of using low-carbohydrate diets and forcing the patient to make their own carbohydrates, it may be better to use fiber (complex carbohydrates) to create a better sense of fullness after a lower-calorie meal. Weight loss improves the ability to achieve diabetic regulation 13-fold but must be done smartly as a greater than 2% weight loss per week is dangerous to a cat and promotes the development of a liver disease calledhepatic lipidosis. A good goal is 0.5-1% weekly. Your veterinarian can design a weight loss plan. Several therapeutic diets are designed for this use. Your veterinarian is your best source of information for what to feed your diabetic cat. Obviously, there are individual concerns, a concurrent illness that may require diabetic modifications, and logistics issues to consider. You can also see a professional veterinary nutritionist to devise a homemade diet. The biggest point is that diet strategy is an important part of diabetic regulation.

Category: Dietary Therapy for Hyperthyroidism in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources There always seems to be the occasional cat for which the traditional therapies do not seem to be appropriate. Iodine is an essential ingredient your cat needs to make thyroid hormone; therefore, it should not be surprising that the production of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone requires excessive amounts of iodine (in the case of hyperthyroidism). Since iodine comes from the diet, it turns out that it is possible to create a diet that is restricted enough in iodine to preclude the production of excessive amounts of the hormone yet not so restricted that an iodine deficiency results. Hill’s Pet Nutrition has developed such a diet, called y/d, and it has been an alternative to the more traditional therapies since 2011. The diet is available in both dry and canned formulations in some regions. Always consult with your veterinarian before changing your pet’s therapeutic diet. How Long do you Have to Feed the Diet for the Cat Not to be Hyperthyroid Anymore? Several studies have been done, and hundreds of cats have been evaluated. Many cats will have normal thyroid levels in the first two months of diet use; however, a full response can take up to 12 weeks. By 12 weeks on the diet, 90% will show normal thyroid levels. The diet is ineffective in approximately 10% of cats eating it. Can a Cat Have any Treats While on this Diet? Unfortunately, there are no acceptable treats. Feeding ANY thing other than the therapeutic diet could interfere with the effectiveness of treatment. Foods or treats meant for other pets in the home should be kept away from a cat on this form of therapy. Also, hyperthyroid cats who roam outside may be eating any number of things out in the world. It is unlikely that their diet can be controlled enough for this form of therapy to be effective. In fact, if the cat on y/d is still hyperthyroid after eight weeks, it can be assumed that the cat is finding another iodine source. The cat might simply be cheating on the diet, getting extra iodine in medication or in drinking water, or even from the surface of a food bowl. Can Other Cats in the Household Eat this Diet Safely? After over a decade of Y/d diet availability, it appears that normal cats may safely eat Y/d diet. No reactions or problems were found when the diet was experimentally fed exclusively to normal cats for a two-year period. Further, no issues have come up in the pet-owning population. If multiple cats are present in the home and feeding separately is problematic, it should be fine to feed all the cats the iodine-restricted diet. The manufacturer suggests taking a week to transition the cat from his normal food to this one, not because of the iodine issue but because it is always a good idea to avoid an abrupt food change. After the transition is complete, Hills recommends a thyroid level, kidney parameters, a recheck exam, and a urine specific gravity (test for urine concentration) after four weeks and again after eight weeks on a Y/d diet. If your cat is still not showing a normal thyroid level in eight weeks, it is worth going out to 12 weeks and evaluating one more time. After your cat has achieved a normal thyroid level, an exam, and blood work should be performed every six months. In cats with concurrent kidney disease, lab work is recommended after two, four, and eight weeks on the diet and every three to four months thereafter. What about Switching a Cat on Methimazole Over to the Diet? The manufacturer recommends simply switching from medication to diet directly with no transitional period. Simply discontinue the medication and start the diet. Methimazole, surgery, and radiotherapy are well-reviewed effective therapies for feline hyperthyroidism. Where this diet fits in the picture and whether it should replace traditional therapy or be considered an acceptable last resort remains to be seen over time.

Category: Home Testing of Blood Glucose for Diabetic Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources The video on this page is provided as a resource to owners of diabetic cats who wish to learn how to conduct home tests that determine blood glucose (blood sugar) readings for their cat. Working with your veterinarian, this technique can greatly improve the quality of life for diabetic cats by allowing blood glucose measurements to be determined without the undesired influence of "stress" that may accompany in-hospital testing. We recommend that you discuss any questions you may have after viewing the video with your veterinarian. Work closely with your veterinarian, both after the initial diagnosis and long term, to design the optimal home testing program for your diabetic cat. Remember that your cat will need to be on a new dose for more than a week before it's worthwhile to test your cat to determine the effect of any changes. Your veterinarian will work with you and advise you whether she/he wants a glucose curve run (a series of measurements taken over a 12-hour period) for determination of dose adjustment, OR whether you are to be armed with this technique for emergencies only. It is very important that you do not adjust the dose of insulin on your own without consulting your veterinarian, as errors can be made that can be extremely detrimental to your kitty.

Category: Hyperthyroidism Medication for Cats (Methimazole)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources The most common medication prescribed to treat feline hyperthyroidism is called methimazole (trade name Tapazole or Felimazole). This medication has virtually replaced the older medication propylthiouracil or PTU because methimazole is effective without as much tendency for side effects. In the United Kingdom and Australia, carbimazole is sometimes used. Because carbimazole is converted to methimazole in the body, the information here for methimazole also holds for carbimazole. All these medications block the production of T4 and T3. Thyroid hormones that are already in the body when medication is started are still in play, so it takes three to four weeks before thyroid blood tests show the effect of treatment. It is important to understand what the potential side effects of methimazole and its relatives are and the monitoring that is generally recommended. The thyroid nodule, which can be detected in a cat's throat, will not reduce in size with treatment and may, in fact, get larger. Advantages of Using Methimazole Disadvantages of Using Methimazole Medication must be given at least daily (usually twice daily). Some cats simply will not take oral medication reliably or cooperatively at this frequency, and providing medication in the cat's food is notoriously inconsistent. Methimazole is available as a small tablet and, more recently, in a flavored liquid. Methimazole can also be custom-made into a chewable or liquid in an assortment of flavors by a compoundingpharmacy. It is also possible to convert methimazole into a gel administered on the hairless inner surface of the cat's ear (see below). Most side effects occur during the first three months of methimazole therapy. Periodic blood testing to examine the T4 level, white blood cell patterns, kidney function, and liver enzymes should be done. Be sure to ask your veterinarian to review an appropriate schedule for your cat. Side effect potential can be reduced by beginning at a smaller dose and working up to the full therapeutic dose over the first couple of months of therapy. May be given with or without food. Keep it away from light and store it at room temperature. Do not refrigerate. Transdermal Methimazole Many cats remain untreated for this ultimately debilitating disease because their owners cannot administer the medication. For many cats, even converting the medication into liquid does not yield a comfortable alternative. Fortunately, another format for methimazole administration has emerged: transdermal gel that is applied to the hairless portion of the inner ear. Advantages of Transdermal Therapy Disadvantages of Transdermal Therapy Is there an Alternative to Methimazole? It seems there are always some cats who cannot take methimazole due to side effects and cannot undergo radiotherapy due to expense. An alternative medication called ipodate (an iodine-based radiographic contrast agent) has been investigated. This medication inhibits the conversion of T4 to T3 (unlike methimazole, which inhibits the production of T4). In a study of 12 hyperthyroid cats, eight responded well to ipodate with no negative side effects. More severe cases of hyperthyroidism tend not to respond. This seems like an attractive alternative, except that nearly as soon as the research was published, the product went off the market, having been surpassed in radiology by more efficient contrast media. A similar compound called iopanoic acid appears to be similar in effect to ipodate but is difficult to obtain. It is available through compounding pharmacies, if at all. Another approach for cats who cannot take methimazole involves a combination of potassium iodate and a heart medication called propranolol. Potassium iodate blocks the thyroid gland’s uptake of iodine. Propanolol is used to control the heart disease that is common in hyperthyroid cats, and the dose depends on the patient’s heart rate. Side effects of potassium iodate consisted of upset stomach and depression in 13 out of 20 cats and were controlled by reducing the dose. While all cats in this study seemed better with medication, less than 50% achieved normal lab values; furthermore, all the cats in this study took these medications in preparation for thyroid surgery, so long-term follow-up was not conducted. Still, for a cat who cannot tolerate more conventional treatment, this may be a reasonable alternative. Specific protocols for either of the above therapies are outlined inThe Options for Treating Hyperthyroidism,by Dr. D. Bruyette, in the November 2004 issue ofVeterinary Medicine.

Category: Insulin Administration in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Insulin is the injectable medication you use to control your diabetic cat’s blood sugar. The goal is maintaining blood sugar levels in an acceptable range over the course of the day with once or twice a day dosing (usually twice.) Keeping the sugars in the proper range will control the excessive urination and appetite that your cat suffers from, and it will require some trial and error experimentation to get the correct dose. A dose will be selected based on what research has shown to be a good starting point, and after a couple of weeks your cat will return for a glucose curve in which blood sugar levels will be mapped out over the course of a 10 to 24 hour period. The curve will show if the insulin lasts long enough and if the dose should be raised, lowered, or kept the same. Alternatively, you can learn how to monitor your cat’s blood glucose levels yourself but if you are a beginner you may want to master giving the injections before moving on to taking blood samples. Insulin is a simple molecule but it does differ slightly between species (i.e., cat insulin is different from dog insulin, which is different from human insulin). There are currently four insulins commonly in use for cats: Vetsulin (also marketed as Caninsulin® in other countries), PZI insulin (currently available as Prozinc® insulin), Lantus® insulin (also called Glargine® or Basaglar®), and Humulin (genetically engineered human insulin available in several formulations with different durations of action). Vetsulin is of pork origin, which is handy for dogs because canine and pork insulin are identical. Vetsulin can also be used in cats, although feline insulin is closer in structure to beef insulin. Vetsulin is considered to be an intermediate-acting insulin. It is available in a vial to be used with syringes or as an injection pen, which many people find easier to use than a syringe. PZI insulin is a long-acting insulin formerly available as a beef origin product. After its manufacturer exhausted its supply of beef pancreas it became unavailable, much to the consternation of many diabetic cat owners. Fortunately, a human origin PZI insulin (called Prozinc®) became available at the end of 2009. Lantus® insulin (Glargine) was marketed for human diabetics as a peakless insulin, meaning that it maintains glucoses in a narrow range. It is a long-acting insulin used in humans to provide a basis for glucose control, which is then fine-tuned with short-acting insulins. Lantus has proved very effective for diabetic cats and is available at most regular drugstores.It comes in both a vial to be used with syringes or in an injection pen form. A generic called Basaglar® is also available but only as an injection pen. Recent increases in the price of glargine insulin has led to a resurgence in popularity of both Vetsulin and ProZinc insulin for cats.  Another similar human insulin called detemir (brand name Levemir®) is becoming popular.  This is also a long-acting insulin and it is available in either pen or vial formats. Humulin was formerly available in several forms: N, L, R, and U, each with a different duration of action. Recently U and L have been discontinued. Humulin R is fast acting and is similar to insulin secreted by one’s body. This insulin acts too fast and lasts too short a time to be useful for pets in the home setting. It is often used in the hospital setting to quickly reduce dangerously high blood glucoses in an emergency. Humulin N is intermediate acting. These are the most commonly used forms of insulin and are usually used twice a day in pets. In general, this insulin is not long-acting enough for feline use. It is normal for a small white layer to settle in the bottle after it has been sitting. This layer must be evenly mixed into the solution before drawing up the dose. The manufacturer of Vetsulin recommends shaking the bottle to mix, but other manufacturers prefer simply inverting the bottle gently or rolling it in one's palms so as to prevent bubbles from forming. Be sure you understand the dose of insulin you are to use.Do not alter the dose on your own  Storing Insulin As insulin prices increase, it is important to take good care of the bottle you have. You do not need to refrigerate insulin, and human diabetics commonly do not refrigerate their insulin as it is less objectionable to inject room temperature insulin versus cold insulin. That said, the bottle or pen of insulin lasts a much shorter time for a human so contamination is less of a concern. Some insulins do not contain preservatives and probably should be refrigerated, so check with your veterinarian. Here are some additional principles of insulin storage. By Syringe There are two types of insulin syringes: U-40 (for insulin of the 40 units per cc concentration) and U-100 syringes (for insulin of the 100 units per cc concentration). The type of syringes used must match the insulin used. Most human insulins (Lantus®, Detemir®, Humulin®, etc.) are 100 units per cc while most veterinary insulins (PZI and Vetsulin) are more dilute at 40 units per cc. Insulin syringes may be available through your veterinarian’s office or through your regular drugstore but do not be surprised if a prescription is needed from your drugstore. Insulin purchased at the drugstore may or may not require prescription. Insulin is considered an over-the-counter medication for humans but when it is used in pets, it is technically off-label so prescription may be needed. Insulin syringes are made extra fine so that human diabetics will not feel them. Veterinary syringes are similarly fine and your pet should not object to injections. Syringes come in 0.5 cc volumes and 0.3 cc volumes. The syringes are graded in units. The smaller the volume, the easier it will be to read the tiny unit gradations. We recommend the 0.3 cc size for cats as it is easier to read the gradations, especially with U-100 syringes. When drawing up the insulin, always hold the bottle vertically to avoid unnecessary bubbles in the syringe. Since insulin is being given under the skin, the presence of bubbles is not an enormous problem (as it would be with an intravenous injection) but we still want to minimize the presence of bubbles for the sake of measurement accuracy. If you get bubbles in the syringe, flick the syringe with your fingers until the bubble rises to the top and then simply push the air out of the syringe with the plunger. Before injecting your pet, practice drawing up the correct amount of insulin and feel comfortable handling the bottle and syringes.  View avideo guidedemonstrating how to draw up insulin. (The video is made on behalf of Prozinc® insulin, but the procedures are the same for any of the insulin vials.) Used syringes or pen needles should be placed inside a thick plastic container (such as a liquid laundry detergent bottle or similar receptacle). If the needle is enclosed in such a container, the entire container can be closed up and disposed of in the regular trash at home. Special containers can be purchased for needle disposal or the used syringes can be returned to the veterinary hospital for disposal if you prefer. By Injection Pens The pen injects its insulin via a push-button mechanism that does not require as much manual dexterity as a syringe. There is also a dosing dial that allows for accurate measurements. The VetPen is loaded with a cartridge that lasts several uses while a new needle tip is placed for each use. Fresh insulin cartridges are available to reload the pen. Human pens are fully disposable so when the cartridge of insulin runs out, the pen is discarded and a new pen is used. Insert the needle tip through the pet's skin and press the button. The needle should stay in place under the skin for a few moments (the manufacturer recommends counting to 5) so that all the insulin dose can be expressed from the pen. If a human pen is being used, you will need to get special longer needle tips as the short human needles tips may not penetrate animal skin properly. Thisvideoexplains the VetPen process. Disposing Needles Used syringes or pen needles should be placed inside a thick plastic container (such as a liquid laundry detergent bottle or similar receptacle.). If the needle is in such a container, the entire container can be closed up and disposed of in the regular trash at home. Special containers can be purchased for needle disposal or the used syringes can be returned to the veterinary hospital for disposal if you prefer. How to Give the Injections First, feed your cat. The blood sugar of a pet who has not eaten a normal meal but receives insulin may drop to a dangerously low level. If your cat is not eating, this could indicate a need for a checkup with your veterinarian. After your cat has eaten, you are ready to give the injection. Pull up a handful of your pet’s scruff. A triangle of skin is formed. Aim your needle for the center of this triangle and stick the needle in. The photos here show the injection given straight in the scruff but you actually want to vary the location with subsequent injections: sometimes use the center of the scruff, and sometimes use the loose skin towards the sides or over the shoulders. By varying the location, you avoid creating scarring or fat deposits that could interfere with insulin absorption. Do not be shy or the needle will not penetrate the thick skin in this area. Pull back slightly on the syringe plunger to be sure you do not get blood back in the syringe. If you do see blood, pull the syringe out and start over. If you do not see blood, press the plunger forward and deliver the insulin. If there is struggling or your cat escapes, or for some reason you are not sure if your pet got the entire dose of insulin, DO NOT GIVE MORE. Simply wait until the next scheduled dose. The manufacturer of Prozinc insulin put together avideo on giving insulinto your cat. (Again, these steps would be the same for injecting any insulin.) What to Watch For It is not unusual for a pet’s insulin requirement to change over time. When this happens, you will notice a return in weight loss, excessive appetite, and excessive thirst and urination. This is an indicator that your pet needs a glucose curve to re-adjust the insulin dose. Be clear on how to recognize hypoglycemia (listlessness, incoordination, potentially even seizures or collapse). If you are suspicious of this problem and the cat is relatively subtly affected, simply feed an irresistible meal. Be sure you have Karo syrup, nutrical gel or some other sugar source for your cat in case it becomes necessary to drizzle some in the cat's mouth.

Category: Laboratory Tests Confirming Cushing's Syndrome
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Once there is some reason to suspect Cushing's disease based on the history, physical examination, and initial laboratory testing, it is necessary to do specific testing to confirm it. There are several options. We will begin with dogs and then discuss cats. Canine Cushing's Disease Testing The Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression TestUsually takes 8 hours in the hospitalDexamethasoneis a cortisone-type hormone that is used therapeutically for numerous conditions. When given dexamethasone, the dog's pituitary gland will perceive that there is a steroid and shut off its stimulatory message to the adrenal glands. In the normal animal, this means that a drop in blood cortisol level will be seen 8 hours after a tiny dose of dexamethasone is given intravenously. If either the pituitary tumor or the adrenal tumor form of Cushing's disease is present, the pituitary is not responsive to the presence of dexamethasone and continues to produce its stimulatory message regardless.  As a result, no drop in cortisol level is seen at the end of eight hours. This test is currently considered the most accurateto confirm Cushing's disease.Approximately 90 percent of dogs with Cushing's diseasewill test positive with it. To Run this TestIdeally the low dose dexamethasone suppression test is run in the morning. A baseline cortisol level is measured, a low dose of dexamethasone is given intravenously, and blood samples are checked again in 8 hours. Sometimes a 4-hour sample is also drawn as the pattern of suppression over the entire 8 hours may helpclassify the type of Cushing's disease. The pet will require at least 8 hours in the hospital. The ACTH Stim TestRequires one to two hours in the hospitalCentral to the concept of Cushing’s disease is the over-production of cortisol. It follows then that the adrenal glands of the Cushing’s patient would possess large amounts of stored cortisol hormone. So how do we detect these unusually large amounts of stored hormone vs. normal? Here's how: we give a dose of ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone), which is the hormone the pituitary gland uses to stimulate release of cortisol. Basically, we give a dose of ACTH and see if we get a normal cortisol release or an extra-large one. A baseline cortisol level is drawn, the ACTH is given as a shot, and then in 1-2 hours a second cortisol level is measured to compare. In this way, the adrenal gland's potential to release cortisol is measured. To Run this TestIdeally, the patient is fasted overnight and the test is performed in the morning between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. A blood sample is drawn, a dose of ACTH is given, and two hours later a second blood sample is drawn. When Would we Run this Test?Given that the Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression test is more accurate, when might we run this test instead? It turns out that this is the only test that can be used if Cushing's disease from overuse of steroid medications is suspected; the low dose dexamethasone suppression test does not work if medications have suppressed the patient's natural system. The ACTH Stim test is also crucial in monitoring Cushing's patients during their treatment. This test is more specific than the low dose dexamethasone suppression test meaning that the strongly positive dogs definitely have Cushing's disease (false positives are unusual) but since it is not a very sensitive test, the University of California Veterinary School no longer recommends this test to determine whether or not a dog has Cushing's disease. This is, as mentioned, the test that is used to monitor the treatment of Cushing's disease, however, and a dog being treated for Cushing's disease will likely look forward to many ACTH Stimulation tests ahead. The Urine Cortisol/Creatinine RatioThis is a screening test for Cushing's disease; a positive test here does NOT confirm Cushing's syndrome but a negative test DOES rule it out. In this test, a single urine sample is collected to determine the relative amounts of cortisol and creatinine (creatinine is a protein metabolite that is constantly excreted in urine). If there is a high ratio - a relatively high amount of cortisol being excreted - further testing is in order. Ideally for this test the urine sample is collected at home so that cortisol secreted in response to the stress of visiting the vet's office does not interfere with results. Feline Cushing's Disease Testing The Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression TestThe testing situation is somewhat similar in cats, though the ACTH Stim test is generally not considered useful. This test is performed similar to the way it is performed with dogs; however, the dose of dexamethasone required to test a cat is substantially higher as cats are more resistant to the effects of steroids. The test still requires eight hours in the hospital and the cat should be relaxed and kept quiet during the stay. If the cat is the type to experience a great deal of stress in visiting the vet's office, consider the urine cortisol:creatinine ratio. The Urine Cortisol/Creatinine Ratio This test provides an excellent screening test for Cushing's disease in cats and can be performed to include a high dose dexamethasone supression test to further categorize the Cushing's disease so as to best determine treatment. The owner should bring urine samples collected first thing in the morning on three consecutive mornings. Having the sample collected at home removes the possibility of interference from vet visit-induced stress. The first two samples are used to determine if the cat has Cushing's disease and the ratios are averaged. On the second day (after the second sample is brought in) dexamethasone pills are given to the cat at home and the sample from the third day is used to determine the type of Cushing's disease the cat has. Collecting a cat's urine at home is easier than it sounds. The cat is confined overnight and in the morning is allowed access to the litter box. The easiest way to collect the urine is to place a sheet of cellophane over the box. The cat will runkle this up a bit scratching around but only a small amount need be caught on the surface of the cellophane. A syringe can be used to suck up the sample and store it for transport to the veterinary clinic. No blood drawing is needed and the cat does not have to actually come to the vet's office for the test. The problem is that urine cortisol:creatinine ratios are possibly too sensitive and may generate false positives. For this reason, the low dose dexamethasone suppression test is listed by most experts as the screening test of choice for cats. It is important to note a diagnosis of Cushing's disease but it is equally important to consider that successful treatment of Cushing's is about controlling symptoms. If the symptoms do not warrant control, then treatment should be postponed until they are more problematic. After it has been determined that a pet has it, it is important to determine the type of Cushing's disease (adrenal vs. pituitary tumor).The next sectionon classifying the type of Cushing's reviews how this is done. Treatment options and prognosis are highly dependent on the type of Cushing's disease the pet has.

Category: Laboratory Tests Hinting at Cushing's Syndrome
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources When an animal sees the veterinarian for a potential clinical problem, an initial database is collected in the form of a blood panel and urinalysis, and possibly a urine culture. There are some tip offs to Cushing's syndrome that may be noted and added to the list of observed symptoms as evidence. The Stress Leukogram This term refers to the relative proportions of different types of white blood cells. There is a typical pattern produced by cortisol as the body responds to stress. This pattern is called a stress leukogram. If this pattern is seen in a patient that does not seem stressed, there is a possibility that an excess of cortisol is present. The stress leukogram classically involves: These are all types of white blood cells counted in a test called acomplete blood count(or CBC for short). You don't need to know what those cells do; it is the pattern of increases and decreases that suggests cortisol is afoot. Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Alkaline phosphatase (often abbreviated ALP or SAP) is one of the so-called liver enzymes, meaning that it is chiefly found in the liver. There is a form of this enzyme that is produced in high levels in response to cortisol. This enzyme is not harmful in excess levels but since such marked increases in its levels are associated with cortisol, this would be a good hint that either this patient is taking cortisone-type medications or has Cushing's disease. Elevated Cholesterol This is a common finding in most endocrine diseases and, in this case, results from abnormal fat mobilization. High levels of circulating cholesterol may, as in humans, alter normal circulation and blood clotting. These classic laboratory findings complement the physical examination and may lead your veterinarian to recommend definitive testing for Cushing's syndrome. Not all of these findings need be present to suggest further testing for Cushing's Syndrome but the suggestion is stronger as more of these hints are detected. Unconcentrated Urine and/or Bladder Infection When a pet drinks excessive amounts of water, the extra water is passed as urine. As long as there is extra water, urine will be dilute. Because of the immunosuppression associated with Cushing's disease, there may be evidence of bacterial infection as well, or such evidence may be concealed by the dilution of the urine. Ideally urine should be cultured if it is too dilute to reliably detect white blood cells or blood. Recent studies have shown that 20 percent of dogs with Cushing's disease have an inapparent bladder infection. Feline Cushing's Disease is a Little Bit Different The classical screening test findings seen in dogs are not typically seen in cats. Most cats with Cushing's disease do not have a stress leukogram as described above. They do not have elevations in cholesterol or liver enzymes and their thyroid levels tend to run in the normal range. Most cats with Cushing's disease arediabeticand have findings referable to that. Classically the cat with Cushing's disease has especially intractable diabetes mellitus and diabetic control seems to require high insulin doses if it can be controlled at all. It is generally the diabetes mellitus that is diagnosed first in a cat with Cushing's disease. If the diabetes does not respond to insulin as expected, underlying causes are sought and one of these is Cushing's disease.

Category: Signs, Symptoms, and Diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English See article summary below. Additional Resources  Hyperthyroidism is the most common hormone imbalance in cats. This disease emerged in the 1980s but has become so common that a wealth of information is available. What is Thyroid Hormone? Active thyroid hormone (nicknamed T3, short for triiodothyronine) sets the body’s metabolic rate, sort of like a volume dial. One might say T3 determines how hard or how fast each cell works to do its job. Every cell of the body is affected by T3. The thyroid glands (there’s one gland on each side of the windpipe) do not produce T3. Instead, they produce an inactive form called T4. Tissues of the body absorb T4 and convert it to T3. Doctors will readily make references to T3 and T4. It is a good idea to know what they are referring to. While T3 is the active hormone, it turns out that more meaningful information is gained by measuring T4. Your veterinarian will probably mention monitoring your cat’s T4 level. Clinical Picture of Feline Hyperthyroidism There are many clinical signs associated with feline hyperthyroidism. The hallmark sign isweight loss despite an excellent appetite. Hyperthyroid cats are also extra thirsty and are sometimes brought to the vet because they are drinking so much water. They are commonly restless and especially demanding of attention and/or food. Many cats have chronic intermittent vomiting or diarrhea and may be urinating in inappropriate locations. In a normal cat, the lobes of the thyroid gland cannot be felt with your fingers. In the hyperthyroid cat, at least one lobe is usually prominent and may be detected by your veterinarian during a physical exam. Hyperthyroidism is generally a disease of older cats. The average age at diagnosis is about 13. How to Tell if a Cat is Hyperthyroid A blood panel is often ordered in the diagnostic work-up of any significant clinical signs. The blood panel surveys hepatic, renal, hematologic, and other body systems. Although there are multiple changes that fit hyperthyroidism, mild increases in liver enzymes are most commonly observed indicating mild (usually clinically insignificant) damage to the liver and/or bones. The elevated T4 level forms the basis for diagnosis; there can be no other diagnosis in such a case. If T4 is markedly elevated, the diagnosis is clear. Some cats have borderline results and require further testing. When T4 Levels are Borderline In older cats, the normal range for T4 is much lower than it is for young adult cats and thus sometimes it is not obvious whether a cat is truly hyperthyroid. Further, T4 levels are readily reduced by other disease states and there is some normal but unpredictable fluctuation in T4 throughout the day. The easiest tests for your veterinarian to perform are called the T3 suppression test and the equilibrium dialysis-free T4. To do the T3 suppression test, the owner must be able to give the cat a pill three times a day for two days and return to the vet’s office for a blood test on the third day. In other words, some specific scheduling is necessary and the cat must be able to take pills. The pill given is a T3 pill, an active thyroid hormone. After two days of exposure to this medication, a normal thyroid will respond by reducing its T4 production. In a hyperthyroid cat, this negative feedback mechanism is not operating and the T4 level will not drop. Even borderline cases can be sorted out. The Equilibrium dialysis-free T4 represents a certain form of thyroid hormone, the part that is not bound to blood proteins as measured by a laboratory technique called equilibrium dialysis. Unlike T3 and total T4 measurements, the equilibrium dialysis-free T4 is not as subject to the influence of non-thyroidal illness. For example, it is normal for total T4 levels to drop when you are sick; however, the free T4 portion remains unchanged. In this way, a hyperthyroid cat that is sick from another disease might have a T4 in the normal or borderline range, but the equilibrium dialysis-free T4 would still be high enough to confirm the hyperthyroid condition. The equilibrium dialysis-free T4 is a simple blood test that can be run on any serum sample, though sometimes it must be sent out to a laboratory, thus requiring a few days for results. Of course, a nuclear medicine scan will also identify a hyperthyroid cat readily. The equipment necessary is only available in a limited group of group of radiotherapy facilities. What Causes Hyperthyroidism? Many risk factors are associated with hyperthyroidism in cats, although more research is needed to say definitively what may cause it. The most common abnormality is benign adenomatous hyperplasia, or an overgrowth of thyroid tissue, which leads to your cat producing too much thyroxine (T4). Currently, we don’t know for sure what causes this hyperplasia, but this type of tumor is present in 96-98% of hyperthyroid cats. These tumors are almost always benign (not cancerous) and are a form of goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland)rather than a form of cancer. Many people want to know why their cat’s thyroid gland grew a tumor, benign or otherwise. Risk factors for hyperthyroidism in cats include: Diet and Chemical Exposure It has been speculated that aluminum cans lined with a substance called bisphenol-a (or BPA) affect the thyroid gland and other hormone-producing organs by disrupting hormone receptors. BPA from canned diets may transfer into food containing oils or fats. In areas of the world where this type of can is not used for cat food, hyperthyroidism is not a common disease. Still, it is important to realize that 25% of hyperthyroid cats have never eaten canned foods, so there is likely more than one factor at work. Another study by Dye et al. looked at exposure to bromated flame retardants as a factor in the development of feline hyperthyroidism. These chemicals have become largely present in homes in the last 30 years, about the same time that feline hyperthyroidism went from an extremely rare disease to an extremely common disease. They looked at PBDE levels in young cats, older normal cats, and older hyperthyroid cats and while they readily found PBDE in the blood samples tested they did not find any difference in levels between cats with or without hyperthyroidism. We mention this study as it received a great deal of press attention when it first came out leading many people to read the "headline" that PBDEs were being investigated as a cause of hyperthyroidism in cats and miss the conclusion that no significant difference in groups was found. It should be mentioned that an indoor lifestyle is correlated to an increased chance of a cat being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. All of this has led to many other questions: Why is Treatment Important? Hyperthyroid cats frequently experience reduced quality of life through weight loss, muscle deterioration, chronic vomiting, or chronic diarrhea. Not all cats experience these signs at the time of diagnosis but there are less visible reasons to treat: heart disease andhigh blood pressure. These problems can result in heart failure, sudden blindness, or sudden death and all can be prevented with timely treatment for thyroid disease.

Category: Surgical Treatment for Feline Hyperthyroidism
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources The goal of thyroidectomy is to remove the abnormal thyroid tissue and leave the normal adjacent tissue alone. This sounds straightforward, however, considering that the average hyperthyroid cat is a geriatric patient with special potential for high blood pressure and heart disease, quite a bit of patient preparation is necessary to reduce anesthetic risk.  Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for feline hyperthyroidism largely because of its low-risk and low-stress nature (basically a few injections, a few days of boarding in the radiotherapy facility and some temporary home restrictions); however, there are plenty of geographic areas that do not have nearby radiotherapy facilities and surgery is still performed. For pet families opting for surgery, it is important to understand the precautions needed and issues of concern. It is not unusual for cats with disease in both glands to have one gland larger than the other, making it look like only one is diseased. Patient Preparation Once the cat has been screened for concurrent problems and thyroid levels have been brought into the normal range, then surgery can be scheduled. Surgical complications include bleeding, damage to local nerves in the throat area, and issues relating to blood pressure and heart disease, but by far, the biggest concern is low blood calcium due to damage to the parathyroid glands that sit adjacent to the thyroid. See below for the advantages and disadvantages of treating hyperthyroidism surgically. Advantages of Surgical Treatment Disadvantages and Potential Complications of Surgical Treatment Calcium Crisis: The Most Important Potential Complication of Thyroidectomy This is a serious risk for cats who must have both thyroid glands removed. The blood calcium level must be regulated tightly for normal muscle contraction (including heart muscle) to be possible. This regulation is controlled by the tiny parathyroid glands associated with the thyroid glands. If they are damaged, calcium crisis is a possible risk. There are four parathyroid glands, each lobe of the thyroid gland having one parathyroid embedded within and one sitting on top.      Thyroid Storm: Another Serious Complication of Hyperthyroidsim "Thyroid storm" refers to the phenomenon where the thyroid gland releases large amounts of thyroid hormone in response to adrenaline and related hormones of anxiety and fear. The result is a life-threatening increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. The patient develops heart arrhythmias and shock. The hyperthyroid cat is potentially always at risk for this situation, but preparation for surgery is special. Anesthetic drugs must be carefully selected, and the patient must not be allowed to become frightened or stressed. Since fear and stress commonly begin at home when the cat carrier comes out, and the cat is captured, home tranquilizers may be recommended. Ask your veterinarian if you are concerned about your cat's temperament and fear potential.

Category: Thyroid Treatment Using Radiotherapy for Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Imaging with Nuclear Medicine and Treatment by Radiotherapy This therapy is generally considered the safest and most effective method oftreatmentfor feline hyperthyroidism. Your cat will be given an injection of radioactive iodine (iodine 131) and kept in the facility until the radiation levels have reduced adequately to allow the cat to return home (usually three to four days). Treatment is not invasive, and most cats tolerate brief separation from home without significant stress. After release, there will be a period of time, usually about a week and a half, where the cat will need confinement, flushable cat litter, and restricted human contact because he is still emitting low levels of radiation. After this period, the cat is back to normal without restrictions, and all that is left to do is return for some follow-up lab work over the next few months. The radioactive iodine injection is given under the skin, similar to a vaccine, and the cat is basically boarding afterward until the radiation levels drop. This treatment works because iodine (radioactive or otherwise) attaches to thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine emits high-speed electrons that damage the thyroid tissue from within, effectively destroying the thyroid tumor. The electrons only penetrate a fraction of an inch, which means only the thyroid tissue is affected, and the rest of the cat's body is not. Human beings with hyperthyroidism are similarly irradiated and are not confined in any way afterward, but because, in this situation, the patient is a cat, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission insists on confinement as described above. The potential for side effects with this therapy is very, very low, and it is low stress for the cat. The Pertechnetate ScanIn most facilities (but not all), therapy begins with a nuclear medicine scan called a pertechnetate scan. There is a much lower cost to radioiodine therapy if the scan is skipped; however, if you opt for a facility that skips the scan, you should be aware of the information that is lost in doing so in order to make an informed decision. The pertechnetate scan shows the location and size of the cat’s thyroid glands and confirms hyperthyroidism. The scan also indicates whether one or both glands are involved and provides information needed to calculate the therapeutic dose of iodine 131 that will be used in treatment. An additional benefit of the scan is that it can identify the three to five percent of cats who have a malignant tumor and detect areas of tumor spread. If you skip the scan, you are likely to miss malignant disease, but more importantly, dosing of the iodine 131 will not be based on your cat's individual thyroid mass; it will instead be based on your cat's weight. This leads to the potential for underdosing some cats (necessitating another treatment) and overdosing some cats (making them hypothyroid and necessitating treatment or, worse, tipping borderline kidney function into kidney failure). Scanning can be beneficial, but it does increase the cost of the treatment. We recommend working with your veterinarian to decide the benefit to you and your cat. If the scan identifies a bizarre distribution of thyroid tissue that is typical ofmalignancy (cancer), a different iodine 131 protocol is used. Advantages of this Method of Treatment Disadvantages of this Method of Treatment If kidney function is not thoroughly investigated prior to this therapy, latent kidney failure may be unmasked irreversibly by this therapy. This can be avoided simply by screening potential candidates for kidney failure prior to recommending radiotherapy. Those who have possible kidney insufficiency should be treated with medication to bring the thyroid levels under control. If kidney function begins to show deterioration on this therapy, medication is discontinued, and the need for treating thyroid disease must be reevaluated. If kidney function remains stable on treatment with anti-thyroid medications, then a more permanent therapy (such as radiotherapy) can proceed.

Category: Bacterial Conjunctivitis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva, a tissue that makes up part of the eye and eyelid. In people, the conjunctiva is the white part. Conjunctivitis is common in cats and can be a result of infection or injury. The primary cause of most conjunctival infections in cats is usuallyfeline herpes virus. The treatment for herpes-based conjunctivitis involves a combination of antibiotics and antivirals, both in eye drops and pills. Even cats who have had the herpes vaccine can get conjunctivitis because the vaccination does not prevent herpes, but allows a milder case. However, some conjunctival infections that are primarily viral also have a bacterial infection at the same time. The two bacteria species best known to cause conjunctivitis in cats areChlamydia felisandMycoplasma spp. An infection caused byChlamydiamay cause redness, discharge, and excessive tears. Bacterial conjunctivitis caused byChlamydiais treated with antibiotics. All cats in a household may need to be treated, as some cats who have it do not show any symptoms. Mycoplasmais a natural inhabitant of every cat’s eye, so infection happens when there is an overgrowth of that bacteria. Treatment for theMycoplasmainfection is similar to that ofChlamydia:antibiotics.The goal in treatingMycoplasmaconjunctivitis is to reduce the overgrown number of bacteria back down to a normal level because it is impossible to eliminate them entirely. Who gets bacterial conjunctivitis? Both cats and dogs can get conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or viruses. Conjunctivitis is the most common cat eye disease, and most cats will develop the infection once in their life. All breeds can develop infection, and juvenile and young adults are more likely to get it.   Clinical Signs of Either Form Diagnosis A physical exam of the eye by your veterinarian is the first step, as this will rule out other causes of redness, such as trauma.  The easiest diagnosis is a cytology test, which means looking at scrapings of the irritated tissue under a microscope. If a lot of bacterial and inflammatory cells are seen, it is likely that the eye is infected. Checking scrapings is a quick test for infection that can be done at the clinic during your appointment. PCR is another test that can be used to detect the specific organism causing the infection, but typically needs to be sent out to a lab. Treatment Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, mainlydoxycycline.Mycoplasma and Chlamydiaare the most common bacteria involved in eye infections, and doxycycline is effective against both. Prognosis Treatment should clear the signs and infection. However, if the eye still looks infected or just doesn’t look normal, contact your veterinarian. The ongoing bacterial infection may also be caused by an unknown factor that needs to be treated before the eye infection can be cured. Prevention There is a vaccine forChlamydophila felis, but it is not required and is usually only suggested if your cat is at a higher risk for an infection or in a multi-cat household. There is no vaccine for aMycoplasmaspp. infection because it is normally in the eye anyway. The key to preventing infection is separating sick cats away from the unaffected ones and bringing them to your veterinarian at the first sign of infection.

Category: Eye Removal (Enucleation) in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Answering Your Questions About Enucleation Why Might this Procedure be Necessary? In almost all cases, the eye is removed because it has reached a point where it has no chance of being capable of sight, and it is painful. Trauma to the eye (such as an infected scratch, puncture, or hitting the eye on something sharp), tumors, glaucoma (increased pressure inside the eye), andherpes-related ulcerson the eye (in cats) are all catastrophes. Any of these conditions, or others, create a painful, blinded eye.Brachycephalic breeds, those with flattened faces and prominent eyes, tend to be predisposed to eye injuries, and often it is these breeds that end up with one eye enucleated. The focus must become the relief of pain when restoring vision becomes hopeless. Should Eyes Damaged Long Ago be Enucleated? Eye damage eventually heals, leaving a blinded, shriveled eye. An eye in this condition is usually not painful but might depend on tear production and chronic inflammation. If an eye has reached this stage, the veterinarian can help assess whether residual pain is enough of an issue to warrant enucleation. Most dogs do not require enucleation in this situation, but cats have a special complication for eyes in this condition: they can develop a malignant tumor in a damaged eye ("post-traumatic sarcoma"). This occurs, on average, seven years from the original injury, and most tumors are highly malignant. For this reason, most collapsed eyes in the cat should be removed for cancer prevention. Post-traumatic sarcomas are the second most common primary eye tumor in the cat. Are There Any Alternatives to Enucleation? Most people have a strong preference for their pets to have two eyes and would like to keep both their pet’s eyes if possible. Frequently, this is indeed possible with the help of a board-certified ophthalmologist. Many eye wounds can be trimmed and closed with proper magnification and tiny sutures. Sometimes the inner contents of the eye can be removed and replaced with a prosthesis. (This is called evisceration, and the prosthesis is called a black ball.) This creates a more natural-looking eye but is inappropriate for infected eyes or eyes with tumors. There are also advanced procedures that can resolve glaucoma surgically while still sparing the eye. All of the above are highly specialized procedures that can only be performed by an ophthalmology specialist. Often, enucleation is selected because the other procedures are too expensive (they often cost three or four times as much as enucleation), or enucleation may simply be the best medical choice. Enucleation can be performed by most general practitioners, and referral to a specialist is unnecessary. If you are interested in pursuing an advanced procedure, you will need a referral to a board-certified ophthalmologist. Ask your veterinarian. Is the Surgery Painful or Disfiguring? The Shih Tzu shown at the top of this page is a rescue named "Winky" for obvious reasons. His face shows a typical end result of enucleation. In brachycephalic breeds like Winky's, most owners let the hair grow long over the enucleated side, and the result is not at all objectionable. Pain-relieving medications are needed for the first week or so after surgery, but when healing is complete, the surgical area should be pain-free and comfortable. What Can Be Expected After the Surgery? In surgery, the eye is removed, and the eyelids are sewn closed. Sometimes, there are stitches to be removed in 10 to 14 days, and sometimes, the stitches are buried inside the eye socket. The eyelids will be swollen, and there may be some bruising. Some red-tinged fluid may seep from the incision, which is normal. The eye may at first look like it is simply closed. Over the first week following surgery, the swelling will go down, and the socket will flatten out. An Elizabethan collar is often provided to discourage rubbing or scratching of the eye area. This collar should stay in place for 10 to 14 days until the incision is healed. The pet should be able to eat and drink with the collar in place, but if you are concerned, you may remove the collar at meal time, provided the pet is well supervised. The pet will have lost peripheral vision on the side of the enucleation and may need to adjust to being approached from this side. Cats should be kept as indoor-only pets after an enucleation as the outdoor lifestyle will pose even more hazards than usual. What Signs Would Indicate a Problem? Infection may pose a complication. In this event, the eye area would remain swollen after the initial week, and the incision may drain pus. If this occurs, the infection would require drainage and antibiotics. If you think there may be an infection, recheck with your vet as soon as possible. Remember, some mild oozing of red-tinged fluid is normal during the first few days after surgery. If the eye was enucleated due to a severe tear or rupture, there may be difficulty removing the eye in one piece. Sometimes a small fragment of the rear eye membranes remains behind. If enough of this tissue is still there, secretion of fluid can continue, and chronic oozing from the incision can be a problem. If this is excessive, the eye socket may require a second surgery to be fully cleaned out. What Limitations Will the Pet Have? As long as the other eye can still see, there are not likely to be any serious handicaps. The pet will not be able to see on the enucleation side and may bump into objects. The pet may be easily startled when approached from that side. Otherwise, once healing is complete, life can return to normal. If your pet has a condition that endangers the remaining eye, be sure you understand any preventive measures that should be taken.

Category: Haws Syndrome in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Haws syndrome is an elevation of the third eyelid in both eyes. The third eyelid, or nictitating membrane, is a transparent eyelid some animals have that moistens and covers the eye for protection. In Latin,nictareis to blink. Haw is what the third eyelid in horses are called, although in cats it’s a nictitating membrane. Haws syndrome is not associated with diseases inside or outside of the eyeball, nor the socket. It is also called bilateral third eyelid protrusion, bilateral prolapse of the third eyelid, and bilateral prolapse of the nictitating membrane. The condition has not been reported in dogs. The cause is not known. However, the condition is frequently associated with gastrointestinal (GI) inflammatory disorders. The elevation of the third eyelid may be due to a change in the way nerves are supplied to the third eyelid. A cat's vision is normal with this condition, but may be functionally decreased simply because the elevated third eyelids are blocking the cat's vision. Affected cats may have watery diarrhea that began before the onset of elevation. Diagnosis Diagnosis is primarily made on finding classic clinical signs and eliminating other diseases with a thorough ophthalmic and physical examination. The main sign is a protrusion of both third eyelids. Thankfully, the eyes are not painful. Your veterinarian may do a phenylephrine challenge. Phenylephrine eye drops are applied to the eyeballs to see if the third eyelids return to their normal position within 20 minutes; If they do, then Haws can be confirmed. Treatment This condition is usually self-limiting, so no specific treatment is necessary. Any diarrhea a cat has should be treated as that may be a contributing factor. Monitoring and PrognosisThe prognosis is good because the condition is often self-limiting. In one report about cats, the average time for the third eyelids to return to normal was 47 days; however, the number of cases evaluated was limited. In a separate report, 17 out of 45 cats had a third eyelid protrusion that persisted for more than 4 weeks. If the condition persists, your veterinarian may suggest further diagnostic tests, especially if your cat has GI signs.

Category: Herpes Viral Conjunctivitis: A Feline Problem
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The conjunctival membranes of the eye are basically the pink part under the eyelids and the lining of the eyelids themselves. When they are irritated, they redden and can become itchy, dry, and uncomfortable. The cornea, or clear dome-like covering of the eye, can become involved in the inflammation. It can become cloudy or even ulcerated. Tear production can be reduced, leading to a chronically dry, uncomfortable eye. Conjunctivitis in cats is typically of viral origin, and usually, that means a herpesvirus (feline herpesvirus-1 to be specific) infection. Herpesviruses grow in the tissues of the body that interface with the environment, such as the upper respiratory tissues and conjunctivae. The infection begins with an initial phase that is usually the most severe in terms of symptoms. This phase resolves, but the virus itself does not go away; instead, it retreats into the neurologic structure in the head called the trigeminal ganglion, where the patient’s immune system holds it prisoner. In times of stress, the immune system is taxed, and the virus is able to escape from the ganglion, traveling out via the nerves exiting the ganglion. The result is the return of symptoms. In this way, the infection is permanent but the symptoms of the infections come and go. Symptoms include conjunctivitis as described above but also nasal and respiratory symptoms such as sniffles, runny nose, and fever, basically the symptoms of anupper respiratory infection. As mentioned, the first episode is generally the worst, and subsequent episodes are more mild. Recovery typically begins after 10-14 days of symptoms, and the episode resolves within three weeks. The virus is spread by close contact (usually direct contact) with an infected cat. Herpes virus is very contagious among cats, which means that infection is very common even in cats with no symptoms. As mentioned, the first episode is generally the worst, and subsequent episodes are more mild. Baby Kittens: A Special Situation Herpes infection is a special problem in young kittens, especially those facing stresses beyond just their young age (fleas, poor nutrition, environmental cold, etc.). Feral kittens, waifs of the streets, outdoor kittens, shelter kittens, etc., are all at high risk for herpes infection. Young kittens can produce so much ocular discharge that their eyes gum closed, sealing the infected secretions around the eye. It is important that the eyelids be opened manually to allow drainage of secretions as well as the application of medicine. The swelling of the conjunctivae can be so severe that the eye itself is not visible.In severe cases, the eye can rupture and become permanently blinded. Treatment is crucial, and response to topical therapy is usually dramatic. As mentioned, herpes infection typically causes respiratory signs as well: snotty nose, congestion, etc. These signs can result in life-threatening loss of appetite and dehydration in a young kitten, while signs are generally minor in an adult cat whose immune system is mature. Kittens with obvious discomfort should be examined by a veterinarian. Oral antibiotics will most likely be needed and sometimes hospitalization is also necessary for proper supportive care. Adult Cats Since kittens are so commonly affected with herpes, it is not unusual to find oneself in possession of an adult cat with a history of herpes infection. These individuals will have recurring conjunctivitis in times of stress. Typical signs include squinting slightly in one eye, a noticeable increase in eye discharge (usually brownish in color), redness of the conjunctivae, or all of the above. How do we Know it is Herpes? Basically, any infection that creates an upper respiratory infection will also cause conjunctivitis; herpes is not the only such infection. Often, several agents of upper respiratory infection are active in the same cat at the same time. The chances are that it will not be worthwhile to determine which agents are there; it is more practical to treat bacterial agents and secondary bacterial infections first and then see if antiviral medications turn out to be needed. Right now, the most sensitive test for herpes is PCR testing. This test is able to detect even small amounts of herpes DNA and is much more sensitive than the prior form of testing, which involved antibody levels. The problem is that herpes infection is so extremely common that most cats in any given area are going to test positive, indicating they are harboring the virus in their bodies. Having a herpes infection is not the same as having an active herpes infection, so testing a cat will determine if the cat is harboring herpes but will not determine if herpes is presently active. So, how do we know it's herpes? We probably will not know for sure without a test but if a stressed cat has conjunctivitis involving the cornea, the chances are that herpes is afoot. How Can we Treat it? There are several treatment methods that can be combined in the treatment of feline herpes eye infections. Topical AntibioticsTopical antibiotics quell secondary bacterial invaders and are helpful in controlling the severity of symptoms because secondary bacterial infections frequently complicate Herpes conjunctivitis. It is important to realize that antibiotics do not affect the herpesvirus itself; they only work on secondary bacteria; however, often, this is enough to make the cat comfortable until the virus goes dormant. Topical Anti-viralsThere are several eye drops available that act directly against the herpes virus. They include idoxuridine (no longer commercially available and must be obtained from a compounding pharmacy); Viroptic® (trifluorothymidine); cidofovir (which also must be obtained through a compounding pharmacy), and Vira-A® (vidarabine). These medications are relatively expensive and typically require administration five times daily with the exception of cidofovir, which accumulates in the eye tissues and allows for twice daily dosing. This sounds great, but there are some toxicity issues to be reviewed if one is truly contemplating this latter therapy. Oral Anti-virals While antibiotics have been around for decades, antiviral medications have been much more elusive.Famciclovirwas developed as a herpes treatment for humans and has been found effective for feline herpes as well. While doses and protocols are still being worked out, higher doses of oral famciclovir translate into therapeutic famciclovir levels secreted in tears, effectively creating a topical treatment from an oral product. Because the topical antivirals are frequently inconvenient to use, oral famciclovir combined with a topical antibiotic makes a fair approach to feline herpes conjunctivitis. It should be noted that some infections lend themselves to prevention by the vaccination process, and others do not. Herpes does not; this means that vaccination of healthy cats does not prevent infection for feline herpes; what it does do is lead to less severe signs. Vaccination against feline herpes has been deemed helpful but one should understand that, in this case, the goal is not total prevention of infection but palliation. Eosinophilic Keratitis: A Possible Result of Chronic Infection An especially unpleasant possible outcome of feline herpes infection involves thick white plaques forming on the surface of the eye. A scraping from the plaque can be examined under the microscope for white blood cells called eosinophils, and if they are found, the diagnosis of eosinophilc keratitis is confirmed. The plaques are an inappropriate immunologic reaction to the virus, so immune suppressive topical medications are needed to suppress the reaction. Life-long treatment is typically necessary. Corneal Sequestrum: Another Possible Result of Chronic Infection The Persian breed appears to be particularly predisposed to this reaction to the herpes virus. Here, a section of the cornea actually dies and turns black or dark brown. The fastest route to resolution involves surgical removal of the dead tissue and application of a tissue graft. Not all veterinarians are comfortable doing this surgery, or have the necessary equipment, so discuss with your veterinarian whether a referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist is in your and your pet’s best interest. Non-surgical management is possible with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory topicals but a specialist is best consulted should this complication of infection arise. Can Humans get Feline Herpes? Can Cats get Human Herpes? Thankfully, humans and cats cannot share their herpes viruses. Feline herpes is contagious among cats only, and human herpes is contagious among humans only.

Category: Abscesses from Bite Wounds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An abscess forms when an infected bite wound heals over on its surface thus sealing the deeper infection inside. Fever is generated as the infection incubates. Diseased tissue and the inflammatory cells liquefy into pus. The pus breaks through the overlying surface skin and drains, leading to foul odor, pain, and discharge. The area may or may not heal on its own. What to Look for at Home If the abscess has not yet ruptured, the cat will most likely be feverish, which means you will see listlessness and appetite loss. Depending on how long the area has been swollen, the skin involved may be very tender or fragile. If you look closely, a small scab from the tooth mark that caused the abscess may still be visible on the surface of the swollen area. The fluid pocket will eventually rupture and release foul-smelling pus. The fever may break once the rotten tissue is able to drain. You may not see the sore but you probably will smell it. Some cats will lick the fur away from the wound, making the area more visible. At this point, it is likely to look raw and may no longer be actively draining pus. Sometimes the overlying skin is especially fragile and simply tears away leaving a large raw area. Sometimes the wound is buried in the fur so deeply that it is not apparent. You may only find a tender area and possibly notice the odor characteristic of deep infection. Common areas for bite wound abscesses include the facial cheeks, the legs, and the base of the tail. These are the areas where fighting cats tend to bite one another. Treatment Other Important Things Feline leukemia (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency (FIV) viruses represent serious contagious infections spread by bite wounds. The American Association of Feline Practitioners has guidelines forviral testing. Testing, accomplished by a simple kit that can be done in your veterinarian’s office, ideally should be done 60 days or more from the time of the bite. Outdoor cats should be tested annually for these viruses regardless of vaccination status. We recommend testing at the time of the abscess treatment if a test has not been performed in the last year. This test will not rule out any infection initiated by this bite but will test for any infection from past bites. A positive test could alter your cat's ability to heal. Additionally, positive cats should best become indoor cats to minimize exposure to hazards and reduce transmission of their disease to other cats. If your cat has not been vaccinated for rabies, it is especially important to make sure this vaccine is current. Rabies is transmitted by bite wounds and since there is no effective treatment for either animals or humans, it is important to consider this simple prevention. Be sure you understand how to give medication, perform hot packing, and manage rubber drains if your pet has them.  Most abscesses heal over the course of a week, though larger abscesses can take longer. If your cat’s abscess is not healed in one week, be sure to notify your veterinarian.

Category: Aspergillosis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Aspergillosis is an infection in cats caused byAspergillusorganisms,which are a type of fungus found throughout the world. Infections in cats are rare and most commonly seen in cats that have a poor immune system, such as those with certain infections (e.g. feline leukemia virus) or diseases (e.g. cancer, diabetes). Aspergilluslives best in soil and decaying undergrowth. Two types of aspergillosis can occur in cats: nasal aspergillosis (also called sino-orbital or sinonasal aspergillosis or upper respiratory tract aspergillosis) and disseminated (widely dispersed) aspergillosis, also sometimes called systemic aspergillosis. Nasal aspergillosis is the most common form. Cats become infected after they inhale or breath in microscopicAspergillusspores, which are its reproductive cells, kind of like plant seeds. The fungus then starts to grow inside the structures of the nose and face, such as the nasal cavity and sinuses. Disseminated aspergillosis also commonly occurs from breathing in spores, but instead of just growing in the nose, the fungus travels further into the body. With disseminated aspergillosis, many organs can be infected, especially the lungs, nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract. We don’t understand why some cats develop nasal aspergillosis while others have disseminated infections. Most cats who develop disseminated aspergillosis have a poorer immune system than those with the nasal form, which prevents the body from fightingAspergillusand allows it to spread unchecked. Common symptoms of nasal aspergillosis include sneezing, snoring, and nasal discharge. Sometimes the nose, eyes, or cheeks will seem swollen. Occasionally the lymph nodes under the chin enlarge. Some cats will develop a fever and/or poor appetite. For cats with disseminated aspergillosis, coughing, trouble breathing, loose stool, disorientation, or trouble walking may occur. Diagnosing aspergillosis is difficult. Biopsies may require specific equipment to reach infected tissue in the nose. The fungus can be hard to grow in culture and find in biopsied tissues.Aspergillusblood tests can be inaccurate depending on how far along the infection is. These problems mean that veterinarians will have to perform multiple tests to get an accurate diagnosis. In addition to blood tests, culture, and biopsy, x-rays and lab work will be needed to determine how severely the disease is affecting the body. Certain forms of imaging, such as an MRI or CT scan, may also be needed if it isn’t clear how much of the body has been infected. Treating aspergillosis is also difficult. Areas of diseased tissue must often be surgically removed. Certain antifungal medications can be used in addition to surgery, but they are not always successful. Antifungal medications can also be expensive, and treatment may be needed for months. Even with surgery and antifungal medication, the prognosis for disseminated aspergillosis is poor. Most cats do not survive long, and their quality of life during treatment can be poor. Cats with nasal aspergillosis have a little bit better success with treatment, but the potential for treatment failure is still high. For those that respond to treatment, reinfection or recurrence of the previous infection is common. If you suspect your cat has developed aspergillosis, get to the veterinarian as soon as you can. The sooner a diagnosis can be made, the sooner your cat can be made comfortable and start treatment.

Category: Bacterial Conjunctivitis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva, a tissue that makes up part of the eye and eyelid. In people, the conjunctiva is the white part. Conjunctivitis is common in cats and can be a result of infection or injury. The primary cause of most conjunctival infections in cats is usuallyfeline herpes virus. The treatment for herpes-based conjunctivitis involves a combination of antibiotics and antivirals, both in eye drops and pills. Even cats who have had the herpes vaccine can get conjunctivitis because the vaccination does not prevent herpes, but allows a milder case. However, some conjunctival infections that are primarily viral also have a bacterial infection at the same time. The two bacteria species best known to cause conjunctivitis in cats areChlamydia felisandMycoplasma spp. An infection caused byChlamydiamay cause redness, discharge, and excessive tears. Bacterial conjunctivitis caused byChlamydiais treated with antibiotics. All cats in a household may need to be treated, as some cats who have it do not show any symptoms. Mycoplasmais a natural inhabitant of every cat’s eye, so infection happens when there is an overgrowth of that bacteria. Treatment for theMycoplasmainfection is similar to that ofChlamydia:antibiotics.The goal in treatingMycoplasmaconjunctivitis is to reduce the overgrown number of bacteria back down to a normal level because it is impossible to eliminate them entirely. Who gets bacterial conjunctivitis? Both cats and dogs can get conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or viruses. Conjunctivitis is the most common cat eye disease, and most cats will develop the infection once in their life. All breeds can develop infection, and juvenile and young adults are more likely to get it.   Clinical Signs of Either Form Diagnosis A physical exam of the eye by your veterinarian is the first step, as this will rule out other causes of redness, such as trauma.  The easiest diagnosis is a cytology test, which means looking at scrapings of the irritated tissue under a microscope. If a lot of bacterial and inflammatory cells are seen, it is likely that the eye is infected. Checking scrapings is a quick test for infection that can be done at the clinic during your appointment. PCR is another test that can be used to detect the specific organism causing the infection, but typically needs to be sent out to a lab. Treatment Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, mainlydoxycycline.Mycoplasma and Chlamydiaare the most common bacteria involved in eye infections, and doxycycline is effective against both. Prognosis Treatment should clear the signs and infection. However, if the eye still looks infected or just doesn’t look normal, contact your veterinarian. The ongoing bacterial infection may also be caused by an unknown factor that needs to be treated before the eye infection can be cured. Prevention There is a vaccine forChlamydophila felis, but it is not required and is usually only suggested if your cat is at a higher risk for an infection or in a multi-cat household. There is no vaccine for aMycoplasmaspp. infection because it is normally in the eye anyway. The key to preventing infection is separating sick cats away from the unaffected ones and bringing them to your veterinarian at the first sign of infection.

Category: Bacterial Diarrheas in Puppies & Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bacterial diarrheas are generally a nuisance for the adult animal but can be lethal to a small puppy, kitten, or even a human baby. Most of these problems stem from contaminated food or fecal contaminated environment.Feeding raw food dietsto pets dramatically increases the exposure to infectious organisms to the humans in the family. Since these conditions are also human diseases, it is helpful to have some understanding of what they are, even if there are no young pets or immune-suppressed individuals (human or otherwise) at home. Campylobacter Campylobacterspecies are a group of bacteria capable of causing diarrhea in dogs, cats, humans, and other animals. They have a unique curved appearance under the microscope and are said to be sea gull-shaped.  They are difficult to isolate as they grow in conditions of low oxygen (making them microaerophilic as opposed to being aerobic or anaerobic bacteria). With regard to pets,Campylobacterare generally a problem for the very young. Puppies and kittens have not yet matured immunologically. Plus, because they are small, fluid loss from diarrhea hits them much harder. Furthermore, puppies and kittens are more likely to be housed in groups where fecal cross-contamination is common so they may be more likely to become infected than adult animals. Adult animals commonly haveCampylobacterorganisms living in their intestines, but they do not experience any sickness due to it. In humans,Campylobacterinfection is a leading cause of gastrointestinal (GI) disease; infected dogs and cats can carry the organism and spread it even if they do not have symptoms themselves.  For this reason, pets used for therapy in assisted living communities and similar situations should be screened forCampylobacterby fecal culture before exposure to people with suppressed immunity. Humans are also infected by consumption of contaminated food, water, or raw milk; only 6% of humanCampylobacterinfections are attributed to dog exposure.  That said, exposure to a dog with diarrhea triples a person’s risk for developing enteritis fromCampylobacterjejuniorCampylobacter coli. Studies screening pet animals for inapparentCampylobacterinfections have found surprisingly high incidences of inapparent infection. In one study in the Midwest, 24% of 152 healthy cats were positive, for example. After consuming Campylobacter organisms, they travel to the lower small intestine, attach, and multiply. They produce a toxin that destroys the lining of the intestine with the result being a bloody, mucous diarrhea (though occasionally a more watery diarrhea is described).  Sometimes a fever results, appetite becomes poor, and vomiting can occur.  Incubation is 2 to 5 days.  The organism can survive as long as a month in environmental feces. Diagnosis is made by seeing the sea gull-shaped organisms under the microscope; however, there are so many bacterial organisms on a fecal sample that finding the culprit can be tricky. For this reason, a culture is often performed as a more accurate test. Because the organism is microaerophilic, specific culture requirements must be met; the facilities of a reference laboratory are needed. Treatment is with appropriate antibiotics, such aserythromycin,chloramphenicolortylosin. Salmonella Most people are somewhat familiar withSalmonella.They know it represents a type of food poisoning, probably know it is associated with diarrhea that can be severe, and may even know thatSalmonellaspecies are bacteria. Most human cases ofSalmonellainfection cause fever, diarrhea, and cramping that go away on their own, but in children, it can produce more severe disease. As withCampylobacter, the young are more susceptible to more severe illness because they are smaller and do not have mature immunity.  The same is true with puppies and kittens; adult animals are almost never affected bySalmonellainfection. An important exception to the "Salmonella is rare in adult dogs" rule is the case of dogs fed a raw food diet. It has become popular to feed raw foods to pets with the idea that a raw food diet more closely approximates the natural diet that the feline or canine body evolved to consume, and thus, such a diet should be healthier than commercially prepared foods. In fact, cooking food is central to removing parasites, bacteria, and bacterial toxins from food. A recent study evaluating raw food diets found that 80% of food samples containedSalmonellabacteria and that 30% of the dogs in the study were sheddingSalmonellabacteria in their stool. Adult dogs are often asymptomatic, but any infected animal or person will shed the organism for at least six weeks, thus acting as a source of exposure to other animals or people.Salmonellaorganisms are difficult to remove from the environment and easily survive three months in soil. Again, dogs used for therapy around the elderly or children should be cultured forSalmonella. There are two syndromes associated withSalmonella:diarrhea and sepsis.Salmonellabacteria, once consumed, attach to the intestine and secrete toxins. The toxins produce diarrhea that can be severe and even life-threatening in the young. If this were not bad enough, someSalmonellacan produce an even more serious “part two" (sepsis) should these bacteria invade the body through the damaged intestine, causing a more widespread and much more serious infection. In young animals, the syndrome resulting is similar to that of canineparvovirusthus similar treatment is expected. E. Coli Escherichia colimay be the most common bacterial organism in the world. It lives in our intestines naturally and covers the world we live in. Unfortunately, some strains ofE. coliare not so neighborly and are capable of producing diarrhea via toxin production. Like the other organisms we have discussed, this is a serious problem for the very young and more of a nuisance for adults.  There are three main types of unfriendlyE. coli:EnterotoxicE. coli, enterohemorrhagicE. coli,andenteropathogenicE. coli. EnterotoxigenicE. coliis a common cause of diarrhea in young animals as well as human infants and is responsible for the famous traveler’s diarrhea. These bacteria produce what is called an enterotoxin in the upper small intestine. This toxin, similar to the toxin of cholera, causes the intestine cells to secrete the body's fluid into the intestine, creating spectacular watery diarrhea and what can be life-threatening dehydration for smaller living creatures.  Young pigs, cattle, and other livestock are commonly lost to this kind of dehydration. Again, the younger and smaller the patient is, the more serious this infection is. EnteropathogenicE. colialso produce diarrhea in humans and animals. Rather than a secretory diarrhea as above, they simply destroy the intestinal cells where they attach. Diarrhea still results, but it creates more damage to the intestinal lining. EnterohemorrhagicE. coliis similar to enteropathogenicE. colibut with more associated inflammation. This type does not seem to be a problem for small animals though they can carry it asymptomatically. It would seem that antibiotics would be the obvious treatment for a bacterial disease, yet forE. coliit is surprisingly controversial. It seems that the use of antibiotics can enhance the synthesis of toxins by these bacteria; plus, oftentimes, antibiotic use only serves to makeE. colimore resistant in the GI tract. Antibiotics are generally reserved for those animals (or people) who seem the most sick or who have evidence of bacterial invasion in the bloodstream. Basically, treatment is supportive care until the patient's immune system regains the upper hand. In Conclusion Bacterial diarrheas are an especially serious consideration in the very young and in the weak or compromised, be they human or non-human. It is not unusual for apparently healthy animals to carry these organisms and shed them into the environment and feeding raw foods greatly increases the risk of this kind of latent infection. If you are considering raw food diets, especially if someone in the home is very young or has a compromised immunity, discuss prevention of these infections with your veterinarian.

Category: Cats and Ferrets Had SARS in Laboratory Setting
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English While researching appropriate medicine for humans infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), scientists discovered that cats and ferrets can get SARS from humans, at least in a laboratory. Previously, only wildlife was known to have the virus. What is still unknown for certain is whether or not people can get SARS from infected cats and ferrets, and what role pets play in this disease. That uncertainty could change as research continues, but for now, there is no evidence that pets can give SARS to humans. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), several studies are being undertaken in this area. Scientists gave the coronavirus to six cats and six ferrets. The cats had no signs other than a mild pneumonia. Half of the ferrets, however, became lethargic and one of them died four days later. The animals transmitted the virus to other animals. All of the animals clearly had respiratory disease. The remaining animals all produced antibodies in 28 days. The research was reported in the October 30, 2003, issue of the scientific journal Nature. In theirConsensus Document on the Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)paper, WHO states, “Much more research is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached as to the role of these and other animals in the transmission of SARS to human populations and as animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV. At present, no evidence exists to suggest that these species play a significant role in the epidemiology of SARS outbreaks. However, it cannot be ruled out that these animals might have been a source of human infection.” SARS was first recognized in China, where some animals (raccoon dogs [Nyctereutes procyonoides], ferret badgers [Melogale moschata], and masked palm civets [Paguma larvata]) had a similar virus. According to WHO, rats, mice, poultry, pigs, and rabbits are resistant to infection, but antibody levels are undetermined. InSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as an agent of emerging and reemerging infection(Cheng VC, Lau SK, Woo PC, Yuen KY; Clin Microbiol Rev. 2007 Oct;20(4):660-94), the authors say that horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-like virus and civets are the amplification host. InIsolation And Characterization Of A Bat SARS-Like Coronavirus That Uses The ACE2 Receptor, the authors report whole-genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae). The authors also say: "We report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets, and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs." InSevere acute respiratory syndrome vaccine efficacy in ferrets: whole killed virus and adenovirus-vectored vaccines(See RH, Petric M, Lawrence DJ, Mok CP, Rowe T, Zitzow LA, Karunakaran KP, Voss TG, Brunham RC, Gauldie J, Finlay BB, Roper R; J Gen Virol. 2008 Sep;89(Pt 9):2136-46), the authors say: The ferret may be a good model for SARS-CoV infection because it is the only model that replicates the fever seen in human patients, as well as replicating other SARS disease features including infection by the respiratory route, clinical signs, viral replication in upper and lower respiratory tract and lung damage. The big SARS outbreak ended in 2003, but several smaller outbreaks were reported in 2004, and public health officials expected further outbreaks in the future. However, as of November, 2017, the WHO and the CDC both indicate that there have not been any more cases of SARS reported anywhere in the world.

Category: Clostridium difficile Becoming more Common in North America
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What IsClostridium difficile? Some strains contain genes that allow them to produce toxins. It is the toxins, not the bacteria themselves, that make a person or an animal sick. They can form spores, which can survive for years in the environment and are resistant to many disinfectants. If ingested, the spores germinate and the bacteria begin to grow when they reach the intestine. How Common IsClostridium difficile? HumansIn developed countries,C. difficileis the leading cause of infectious hospital-associated diarrhea in adults and accounts for 15-25% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is becoming more common in North America. The most important risk factor forC. difficileinfection (CDI) is treatment with antibiotics. The antibiotics affect the normal “good” bacteria in the intestine, which sometimes allowsC. difficileto take over and grow faster. Old age, certain cancer treatments, long hospitalization, some acid-suppressants used to treat stomach ulcers, intestinal surgery, and some other procedures also increase the likelihood of CDI. A hyper-virulentC. difficilestrain (ribotype 027/NAP1) has emerged in North America, Europe, and Japan, and has been responsible for epidemics of severe illness in hospitalized patients. Recently, severe illness due to CDI has been reported in some healthy, non-hospitalized people as well. AnimalsA small percentage of healthy dogs and cats (0-4%) carryC. difficilein their intestine. But in puppies, kittens, animals in breeding colonies, and dogs that visit human hospitals, the percentage may be higher (up to 30%). The bacteria can also be found in other types of pets, but it is unknown how common this is. How Do Animals And People Become Infected WithC. difficile? Clostridium difficilelives in the intestine of people and animals. When the bacteria are passed into the stool, they form spores that can survive in the environment for a long time. The bacteria are transmitted when the spores are ingested. This typically happens when there is stool contamination on something a person touches, and then the person touches their nose or mouth. Contamination of food and water can also be a problem. It is unclear ifC. difficilecan be transmitted from pets to people. The types ofC. difficilefound in pets are often the same as those found in people, including the epidemic strain ribotype 027/NAP1. So it makes sense thatC. difficilecould potentially be transmitted between people and animals, but there is still no conclusive proof. For now, it is best to err on the side of caution and considerC. difficiletransmissible between pets and people until proven otherwise. What Happens If A Person Or Animal GetsClostridium difficileInfection (CDI)? HumansIn people, CDI (which is also sometimes calledC. difficile-associated disease, or CDAD) may cause no illness at all, or anywhere from very mild to very severe diarrhea. Additional complications can also occur, particularly in people who are already sick for another reason. In some cases, the disease can be fatal. AnimalsThe vast majority of dogs and cats that carryC. difficilein their intestine do not become ill. However, there does appear to be a link betweenC. difficileand diarrhea in dogs in some cases, and there is one report ofC. difficilepossibly causing diarrhea in two cats. In most of these cases the diarrhea is mild, and clinically appears the same as diarrhea due to other common causes. Occasionally, more severe illness and diarrhea may occur. How IsClostridium difficileInfection Diagnosed? In animals and people, CDI is diagnosed by testing the stool for the toxins that are produced by the bacteria. Just findingC. difficile(by culturing the stool, for example) does not mean that it is causing a problem because not all strains can produce toxins. Even strains that can produce toxins don’t produce them all the time, so the bacteria can be found in perfectly healthy people and animals. Detecting the toxins themselves is the key. Testing animals that do not have diarrhea forC. difficileis not recommended. How IsClostridium difficileInfection Treated? In humans, many cases of CDI are caused by treatment with antibiotics for some other infection. In mild cases, diarrhea may resolve with no additional specific treatment. In severe cases, other antibiotics may be needed to controlC. difficile. Probiotics are not considered effective for the treatment of CDI in humans. Some (if not most) cases of CDI in pets resolve without additional antibiotics. If the animal has a lot of diarrhea it may need to be given fluids to prevent dehydration. There is no vaccine available forC. difficilefor any species. If you (or your pet) develop diarrhea while being treated with antibiotics, tell your physician or veterinarian right away. However, it is very important you only stop or change the medication you are taking or giving to your pet if you are told to do so by your physician or veterinarian. Otherwise, the infection for which the antibiotics were originally prescribed may get worse. What Do I Do If My Pet Is Diagnosed WithClostridium difficile? For surfaces that can’t be bleached, thorough cleaning is the most important step to physically remove as much contamination as possible. Steam cleaning is a reasonable way to reduce the number ofC. difficilespores that may be left in rugs, carpets, or similar floor coverings. Therapy Animals Visiting healthcare facilities is a risk factor forC. difficileshedding in dogs. However, it is unclear whether therapy pets that visit hospitals and nursing homes have an increased risk of developingC. difficilediarrhea. Healthy animals do NOT need to be tested or treated forC. difficile. There are guidelines available to help reduce the risk of pets acquiring infectious diseases in hospitals, which should be followed if your pet is part of a visitation program. These include If I HaveClostridium difficile, Should I Test My Pet? NO. Even if your pet was found to be sheddingC. difficilein its stool, you still would not know if it was the same strain you were carrying. This type of specialized testing is not readily available and is not indicated in most situations. If you haveC. difficile, you should be very thorough about washing your hands after using the washroom. Also try to prevent your pet from drinking from the toilet, if it tends to do so. The risk of disease to the general population posed byC. difficilein house pets such as dogs and cats is: Healthy Adults Individuals with compromised immune systems (e.g. HIV/AIDS, transplant, and cancer patients) are more susceptible to many kinds of infections, including those which may be transmitted by pets. While these individuals are not advised to get rid of their pets, precautions should be taken to reduce the frequency of contacts that could result in pathogen transmission (e.g. avoiding contact with any animal feces), as well as the ability of infectious agents to survive in the household (e.g. prompt and thorough disinfection of potentially contaminated surfaces). Infants and young children (less than 5 years old) are more likely than adults to extensively handle animals if given the opportunity, more likely to touch their faces or mouths, and less likely to wash their hands after handling an animal. Children may “snuggle” with pets such as dogs and cats; this very close contact can increase the risk of disease transmission. Young children should be supervised when playing with animals, and an adult should ensure that they wash their hands afterward, especially before handling food. Older children should be taught to do the same. It is important to note that infants less than 12 months of age are not affected byC. difficile. For these groups, the zoonotic risk posed byC. difficilein house pets such as dogs and cats is likely: Additional Information Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).Clostridium difficileinformationpage.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Clostridium difficileinfection.

Category: COVID-19 in a Tiger
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English This one’s bound to attract a lot of attention, and that can be both good and bad.A tiger at New York’s Bronx Zoo has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The tiger was sick (cough, decreased appetite) and was presumed to have been infected by a caretaker who was infected but asymptomatic. Three other tigers and three African lions also had a dry cough, butonly one tiger was tested because sample collection in these animals requires general anesthesia.  All the affected big cats are expected to recover.  The zoo has been closed to the public since March 16, but the first signs of illness weren’t seen until March 27. On one hand, it’s not too surprising. If domestic cats are susceptible, wild cats should be too.  On the other, there are some noteworthy aspects: As always, don’t over-react. This just reinforces the message I’ve been saying since the January (which, despite all our talk about “One Health” led to a lot of criticism): We need to consider and investigate the potential animal aspects of this disease, such as human-to-pet transmission, in order to help prevent pets from contributing to human disease, and to help avoid creating a (domestic) animal reservoir for this virus. This is still a very much a predominantly human disease, but we can’t completely ignore the role of animals even if it’s small. We can use simple, practical and basically free measures to reduce the presumably low risks to and from animals, and we should: The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Cryptosporidium is a Particularly Challenging Type of Coccidia for Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What are Coccidia and Why they are Bad Coccidiaare a common parasite of young puppies and kittens. They reproduce inside intestinal cells, ultimately killing the cells within which they divide and producing nasty diarrhea when too many intestinal cells have been killed. As thecoccidiaincrease in number, so does the number of intestinal cells being killed. Potentially (for very small or immune-compromised pets), so many intestinal cells can be killed that the host animal dies from its severe bloody diarrhea. Survival is a matter of the host's immune system versus the dividingcoccidia. There are drugs that can kill certain types ofcoccidia,but forCryptosporidium,drugs just reduce the number of organisms and may not be able to clear the infection fully. (More on this later). Coccidiainfection is the scourge of the dairy industry, as it is one of the most common causes of calf death. This infection is similarly a nightmare for small puppies and kittens. Generally speaking, carnivores like dogs and cats get infected withCystoisosporaspecies,while livestock (goats, sheep, calves, and even rabbits) getEimeriaspecies, and these species ofcoccidiado not cross over.  Cryptosporidium vs. "Garden Variety" Coccidia The easiest way to understandCryptosporidiumspecies and how they cause disease is to think of them as another kind ofcoccidia.Cryptosporidiumhave some uniquely unpleasant features, however, that are not shared by routine species ofcoccidia. How Infection Occurs Out in the world,Cryptosporidiumoocysts (the infective stage shown below) are very tough. They resist bleach and most other normal cleansers. Only prolonged exposure to ammonia or extreme temperatures can kill them. This photograph depicts the oocyst releasing sporozoites after it has been swallowed by its new host (as described below). The sporozoites are the stage that kills intestinal cells. The life cycle of this organism is rather complicated, and it is not necessary to understand all the stages. The short version is that an oocyst (sort of like an egg) is passed in the feces of an infected animal. This oocyst is swallowed by another animal by licking the dirt off its fur, drinking contaminated water, or some such activity. The oocyst releases sporozoites (sort of like a spore) into the intestinal tract of the new host. The sporozoite infects an intestinal cell and divides. The spores divide into other stages with other names, which in turn infect more cells. All this cell division occurs asexually for a while until, eventually, theCryptosporidiumbegins a sexual phase: instead of making more copies of itself by simple cell division, it produces male and female cells. Fertilization occurs, yielding oocysts like the egg that started it all. There are actually two types of oocysts: one that is thick-walled and ready to be passed in feces to face the external world, and one that is thin-walled and just infects the host over again from the beginning. This is an important and bad thing so we will say it again: the thin-walled oocyst infects the host over again from the beginning. No contaminated water is needed. No dirty fur is necessary. This is now a self-perpetuating infection. If there is any good news in this, it is that most hosts have healthy immune systems and are able to coexist with low numbers ofCryptosporidiumwithout diarrhea. As will be seen, it is unlikely that medications will eradicateCryptosporidium; the goal in therapy is to eliminate diarrhea rather than clear the organism completely. How Rare is this Parasite? The prevalence ofCryptosporidiumoocyst shedding in dogs has varied from 2% to up to 15 -20% in stray dog populations. Fecal specimens from 200 stray dogs impounded at the San Bernardino City and County animal shelters were screened forCryptosporidiumoocysts, and 2% of dogs were found to be oocyst positive. A similar survey of 206 cats revealed oocyst shedding in 5.4%. Most infections are subclinical, meaning that the host animal is not sick. Humans tend to get their own species of it (Cryptosporidium hominis), while cats and dogs each have their ownCryptosporidium. Pet ownership has not been found to be a significant risk for humans with cryptosporidiosis (i.e., most infected humans get infected from other humans or from livestock). This is generally good news except for the immunosuppressed owner, who might adopt an infected pet without knowing it. Remember, in the immunosuppressed individual, cryptosporidiosis can be serious, so a screening test for a new pet is a good idea in this situation. Screening for Infection A routine fecal flotation test, as is recommended once or twice a year for most pets, is likely to missCryptosporidium.There are two main reasons: first,Cryptosporidiumis extremely small, and second, oocysts are only intermittently shed. At this time more specialized testing such as PCR testing forCryptosporidiumDNA or ELISA tests forCryptosporidiumproteins are the best way to go, but these tests were developed to detect theCryptosporidiumspecies that infect humans so there may be some issues with test sensitivity. Screening routinely forCryptosporidiumis probably not warranted for healthy animals unless they are going to be spending time with immune-compromised individuals. Treatment The bad news is that treatment is difficult. Nothing can really be described as highly effective. A medication called paromomycin has effective but is highly toxic to the kidneys. A medication called nitazoxanide has been effective but causes nausea and diarrhea.Azithromycinandtylosinalso have activity againstCryptosporidiumand are sometimes used. Fortunately, most infected animals have healthy immune systems and, even though medication may not be fully effective, the patient's own immune system is usually able to control, if not fully curtail, the infection. Many animals appear to carry this organism without symptoms. The U.S. Public Health Service and the Infectious Diseases Society of America both recommend that HIV-infected individuals should not bring into their homes: See more details onpet-related guidelines for HIV-positive individuals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) has information on preventing infections from pets. CDC tip: Protect yourself against gettingCrytosporidiumfrom animals.

Category: Cytauxzoonosis in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cytauxzoon felisinfection is highly seasonal and takes place in spring and early summer when the tick population is active. What isCytauxzoon felis? Cytauxzoon(pronounced “sight-oz-o-un”) organisms are blood parasites that were first recognized in Africa as a parasite of antelopes and other ruminants.Cytauxzoonorganisms were not discovered in the U.S. until 1976, whenCytauxzoon feliswas first described as a feline blood parasite affecting and killing cats from forested areas.  Initially, there was concern that livestock were soon to be next as this was a ruminant infection as far as anyone knew, but research showed only cats could be infected. It appears that in the U.S., the natural host of this infection is the bobcat, where most of the time, the infection is minor, and it is only the domestic cat for whom infection is a disaster. Cytauxzoon felisis a single-celled organism that infects both the blood and tissues of the cat. The blood cell stage of the parasite called a piroplasm, is not particularly harmful; it is the tissue stage, called a schizont, that is the problem. The schizont infects immune cells that line blood vessels, which causes them to swell and block off the blood vessels in which they reside. Any tissue that has blood vessels (which is basically every tissue in the body) can be affected, but most symptoms seem to relate to the resulting red blood cell destruction and inflammation. Symptoms start small with listlessness and fever but quickly progress to jaundice, spleen enlargement, pain, and death within one week with a two to three-week incubation period from the time of initial infection. How do Cats get this Infection? Cytauxzoon felisis spread by tick bites. The usually implicated ticks are the American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis) and the Lone Star Tick (Amblyomma americanum). Bobcats and infected domestic cats carry theCytauxzoonpiroplasms in their blood; ticks feed on the bobcats and then drop off and molt to their next life stage. They are still carrying theCytauxzoonpiroplasm when they attach to their next host, and if that next host is a domestic cat, a lethal infection results. The organisms are home to the immune cells lining the blood vessels as described above, and if the host lives long enough, the schizonts will eventually produce offspring (the piroplasms). Bobcats do not get sick during this process. It is the local bobcat population that infects the local tick population. Cats cannot be infected without a tick bite. How is the Diagnosis Made? The cat typically has a fever, with or without jaundice, and is brought to the veterinarian for evaluation. In most cases, the piroplasms are fairly obvious when the blood sample is evaluated. Because the tissue phase of the infection with the schizonts comes first and the blood infection with piroplasms comes after, it is possible that at the time the blood is tested no piroplasms are yet present. Because of the rapid progression of the infection, piroplasms will likely be seen in a few days if they are not at first, so sometimes a second blood evaluation is needed. Because piroplasms sometimes have variable sizes, they are sometimes mistaken forMycoplasma hemofelis,a much more treatable infection. Cytauxzoonorganisms are larger and have a thick “dot” on their ring shape. If the diagnosis is to be made post-mortem (after death), it is usually easy to find the schizonts in many body tissues. Is There any Treatment at all? In one study, a combination of atovaquone andazithromycinyielded a 60 percent survival rate in experimentally infected cats. Atovaquone, an anti-malarian drug, is not readily available but can be obtained throughcompounding pharmacies,and another drug, imidocarb, can be used in the meantime. Cats must be hospitalized, supported with intravenous fluids, and have their blood anti-coagulated so as to prevent inappropriate clotting and vessel clogging with schizont-laden macrophages. A milder strain ofCytauxzoon felisseems to have emerged in west Arkansas and east Oklahoma, where a number of cats have survived without treatment (as do most bobcats). These cats continue to have piroplasms in their blood but seem to have no effect from this. It is yet unknown how this is able to happen. (Different strains ofCytauxzoon, effective medication, and genetics are all theories.) Prevention Since mortality is quite high with this infection and treatment is still highly investigational, prevention is paramount. The most effective prevention is to keep the cat indoors where there is no tick exposure. The next best prevention is to use a tick control product on the cat; note that there are not nearly as many tick products for cats as there are for dogs. Most canine tick products are toxic to cats and cannot be safely used so meticulous label reading is crucial. Just because a product works on fleas definitely does not mean it also works on ticks and the feline label is needed to ensure safety. New products are being approved and released every year, so ask your veterinarian.

Category: Distemper (Panleukopenia) in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Feline distemper, also known as feline panleukopenia, is a very contagious, life-threatening infectious disease of cats. It commonly swoops through a group of cats, especially kittens, leaving a trail of death behind it. Fortunately, vaccination is highly effective and the "feline distemper vaccine" (which also coversupper respiratory infectious agents) is considered to be the core immunization for all cats, regardless of their lifestyle. Most people have heard of feline distemper only through discussion of routine cat vaccinations, but let's talk about the actual disease. The Virus Itself The feline distemper virus amounts to a single strand of DNA surrounded by a protein coating. It is extremely stable in the environment, which leads to its characterization as ubiquitous (everywhere). It can last a year indoors at room temperature. It survives freezing as well as treatment with such common disinfectants as alcohol and iodine. Fortunately, soaking a surface in bleach (diluted 1 part bleach in 32 parts water) for 10 minutes will kill it. Virtually every cat in the world will be exposed to this virus to some extent because the virus lives all around us. Infection occurs when the virus enters the body through the mouth or nose. Whether illness results or not depends on the immunity in the victim vs. the number of individual virus particles (i.e. the amount of virus) entering the body. The feline distemper virus is a parvovirus. Many people are familiar with this term as parvovirus infection is a very real concern for dogs, especially puppies. In fact,canine parvovirusis closely related to the feline distemper virus and much of the information regarding canine parvovirus is true for feline distemper. The feline distemper virus, however, is more difficult to remove from the environment and more lethal in its victims than its canine counterpart. Infection and Disease An infected cat sheds large amounts of virus in all body secretions, including feces, vomit, urine, saliva, and mucus. The virus persists long after evidence of the original body secretion has faded away. The virus enters the victim's body and proceeds to seek and infect rapidly dividing cells. The lymph nodes in the throat are first to be affected and from there, over the next two to seven days, the virus rushes to the bone marrow and intestine. In the bone marrow, the virus suppresses the production of the entire white blood cell line, hence the term panleukopenia (literally, “all-white-shortage”). White blood cells are the immune cells needed to fight the infection, and without them, the victim is completely vulnerable to the advance of the virus. In other words, the first order of the virus's business is to eliminate its host's defenses. From there, it continues to the intestinal tract. There, the virus infects the intestinal cells, causing ulceration leading to diarrhea and life-threatening dehydration as well as bacterial infection as the barrier between the body and intestinal bacteria is lost. The patient dies from either dehydration or secondary bacterial infection. The infection can be so rapidly overwhelming that death occurs before the vomiting and diarrhea even begin. Because most cats are exposed to this virus to some extent, it is unusual for a kitten to have no immunity whatsoever. Furthermore, the vaccine is so effective that even one dose can provide long-lasting protection. As a result, infection is largely limited to unvaccinated younger animals kept in groups such as a colony of barn cats, feral cats, or even a group of shelter cats. Viral numbers (the amount of virus) must be large enough to overwhelm a cat’s partial immunity, but once virus-laden diarrhea begins to gather in the environment, those large numbers can be reached. Death of sick cats is typically considered to be 90%, though it has been said that a kitten who survives the first 5 days is likely to survive the infection. Recovered kittens are considered contagious for six weeks following recovery. Cerebellar Hypoplasia A specific syndrome occurs if infection occurs during pregnancy. If infection occurs in mid or early pregnancy, the kittens simply abort. If the kittens are fairly far along, the cerebellum is involved, leading tocerebellar hypoplasia. The cerebellum is the part of the central nervous system that coordinates balance and movement, enabling one to walk or run on an uneven surface without consciously thinking about it. Without a normal cerebellum, the kitten is born with marked intentional tremors: whenever he focuses on purposeful movement, he tremors so much that normal movement is impossible. Such kittens are called wobbly cats and are notably abnormal but are considered to have good life quality and can be kept as pets as long as they are looked after. Diagnosis of Infection Any kitten with fever, appetite loss, diarrhea, and/or vomiting is a suspect for feline distemper. Classically, a white blood cell count shows almost no white blood cells; there are few causes of white cell counts this low and the infection can be considered confirmed. The SNAP Fecal ELISA test kit made for canine parvovirus is often used in cats as a means to reach a distemper diagnosis. This test detects parvovirus in stool and is felt to be accurate although the test is not specifically labeled for this use by the manufacturer. Vaccination 5-12 days before running the test can lead to a false positive test as the virus from the vaccine will be detected. It is important to keep this information in mind when using this test to make a diagnosis; recent vaccination will cause a false positive. If a dead kitten is available for necropsy (that’s an autopsy in animals), the infection is readily confirmed by laboratory tissue analysis as there are unique tissue findings in feline distemper. Virus isolation, PCR testing, and antibody level measurement are also potential tests for feline distemper. Treatment An infected cat can recover if the cat can be kept alive until the immune system recovers from the panleukopenia and can throw off the infection. This means that invading intestinal bacteria must be kept at bay with antibiotics and aggressive fluid therapy must control dehydration. Hospitalization is required as fluids and medications must be given intravenously. Blood sugar must be supported as well and control of pain, nausea, and hypothermia is crucial. This is essentially the same therapy as for canine parvovirus infection, though the feline experience seems to be more lethal. There is little chance of survival without hospitalization. Recovery If a cat is lucky enough to recover from this infection, generally, no permanent damage is retained, and the cat goes on with lifetime immunity. The distemper virus is shed for up to six weeks after recovery. Disinfecting the environment after infection is a huge challenge; the best protection for newly introduced cats will be vaccination. That said, bleach diluted 1:32 in water with a 10-minute contact time will kill the distemper virus, so it would be prudent to bleach any surfaces that can be bleached. Prevention The American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) suggests starting kitten vaccinations at 6-8 weeks old, with boosters every 3-4 weeks until they reach 16 weeks. A follow-up shot is given one year after the initial series, then every three years. Cat’s antibodies from their mothers usually fade by 12 weeks, but the final FPV vaccine is recommended at 16 weeks. In some cats, these antibodies may last up to 20 weeks. Your veterinarian will recommend an appropriate vaccine schedule for your cat depending on their age and other health factors. Research is continuing in this area; however, the killed virus vaccine has largely been replaced by a modified live virus vaccine, which is not thought to have this problem.

Category: Feline Infectious Peritonitis
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a potentially deadly infection in cats caused by the FIP virus. The disease occurs most commonly in young cats, although it can infect older cats too. It affects multiple organs and comes on very quickly. Previously, limited treatments were available, and outcomes were very poor. However, newer treatments have significantly improved survival rates. Read on for more information on FIP and its treatment options. How Contagious Is FIP? FIP virus is a type of mutated feline coronavirus that infects a cat’s gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Before it mutates, this type of coronavirus is extremely common and highly contagious among cats. However, very few cats that become infected with this type of coronavirus get sick. The few that become sick only show mild signs of GI upset, such as diarrhea or loose stool. Many cats can harbor this type of coronavirus for years, shedding infectious viral particles in their stool and unknowingly infecting other cats. FIP mostly occurs in cats that have already been infected with feline coronavirus. The feline coronavirus mutates into the FIP virus, which then begins to damage the cat’s organ systems. It is uncommon for this mutation to occur; many cats with coronavirus will never have their virus mutate into the FIP virus. It is also extremely rare for a cat with FIP to directly infect another cat with FIP because, unlike feline coronavirus, FIP virus particles are not easily shed and spread to other cats. What Does FIP Infection Look Like? FIP tends to occur in two forms, an effusive form in which fluid develops in areas of the body where it shouldn’t (e.g., the lungs, around the heart, in the belly), and a dry form, in which granular masses form throughout the body and damage internal organs. Sometimes one form will occur first, followed by the other. The effusive form is the most common, (also called "wet FIP.) Signs of FIP include tiredness, not wanting to play or move around, an enlarged belly, trouble breathing, poor appetite, weight loss, fever that may come and go, yellowing of the skin and eyes, poor vision or blindness, and neurological signs like seizures or wobbliness when walking. Not all signs will occur at once, nor will all signs be present in each infected cat. How Is FIP Diagnosed? Diagnosing FIP is difficult because although there are new tests available, veterinarians don’t have one specific test that can confirm FIP. Laboratory tests that scan for FIP virus are often positive in any cat that has feline coronavirus, whether it has mutated or not. Remember that feline coronavirus infection is very common in cats, and many aren’t affected by the infection. A positive test doesn’t necessarily mean that FIP is the cause of a cat’s signs or symptoms. Your veterinarian will need to run multiple tests to get a big picture of whether the FIP virus is present, including analyzing blood samples for internal organ damage, examining samples of fluid obtained from the belly or chest, X-rays (radiographs), and ultrasound to look for fluid and organ damage, and testing for antibodies to FIP/coronavirus or viral particles. Many cases of FIP are presumed based on the cat’s clinical signs or symptoms and the combined findings from the tests, but they are not officially diagnosed. In some cases, diagnosis can only be made after the cat has passed away by performing a necropsy, which is like a human autopsy, and biopsying samples of organ tissues. How Is FIP Treated? Technically, no licensed, federally-approved cure for FIP exists in the USA. However, certain drugs are now available and being manufactured in the USA that have been shown to be very effective against the disease. One such drug that has been successful in treating many cases of FIP, both in veterinary studies and real-life veterinary patients, is a nucleoside analog antiviral medication called GS-441524. This drug has recently become available throughcertain compounding pharmaciesin the United States, but official approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not been granted. However, because there isn't currently an approved drug to treat FIP, the FDA has stated that it does not plan to enforce new drug approval requirements when GS-441524 is prescribed by a veterinarian to treat a cat with FIP. Another drug that has been effective against FIP in veterinary studies is the antiviral medication remdesivir, which is used to treat COVID-19 infections in people. It is metabolized to GS-441524 in the cat’s body and works similarly. These treatments can be very expensive, and the medications may not be easy to get. Further, more studies are needed to determine exactly how safe and effective these treatments are. If you are interested in learning more about GS-441524 or remdesivir, talk to your veterinarian. Treatment for FIP is evolving. Although not FDA-approved, medications like remdesivir and GS-441524 have been shown to be very effective in many affected patients. The FDA has said that they willnotenforce new drug approval requirements when prescribed by a veterinarian to treat a cat with FIP. Beyond these newer treatments, general therapy involves keeping the cat comfortable and reducing organ damage and inflammation. This may include nutritional support, removing fluid from the belly or chest when needed, and prednisolone or other types of steroids. These types of therapies are not curative- they are only meant to keep the cat comfortable. Without FIP treatments like GS-441524 or remdesivir, fluid often rapidly returns once it has been removed, and steroids may not help with inflammation enough to buy an infected cat more time. Sometimes, choosing euthanasia is a kinder option rather than extending the suffering of a cat with FIP, especially if FIP treatments are not available or they are ineffective for your cat. After clinical signs start, many untreated cats with FIP will not live for more than a few days, although some can live for weeks. It is important to discuss a cat’squality of lifewith a veterinarian to determine their level of suffering during the time that is left. Can FIP Be Prevented? Feline coronavirus mutation to FIP virus cannot be prevented, and it is unclear what causes the mutation. Preventing coronavirus from spreading among cats can be attempted, but this can be very difficult as it is extremely common. Possible ways to minimize coronavirus spread among cats include reducing stress, preventing/decreasing fecal contamination in the environment by cleaning litterboxes daily and keeping adequate numbers of litterboxes in multi-cat households, and testing and separating coronavirus-positive cats from coronavirus-negative cats. Even with these measures, coronavirus may still spread. A vaccine for coronavirus is also available, but it does not appear to fully prevent cats from getting coronavirus, nor does it prevent cats with coronavirus from developing FIP. What Should I Do If My Cat Might Have FIP? If you think your cat has started showing signs of FIP, make an appointment to see your veterinarian as soon as possible to confirm the condition and start treatment. Not every cat will survive FIP, even with the newer treatment options; however, the sooner treatment is started, the better a cat’s chances will be.

Category: Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Feline leukemia virus, a retrovirus, is a common infection of cats. It is the cause of more cat deaths, directly or indirectly, than any other organism and is widespread in the cat population. Disease Transmission FeLV transmission most commonly occurs through close social contact. Contact with saliva from infected cats is a primary mode of transmission because the concentration of the virus is high in saliva. But the virus is also shed in blood, urine, feces, nasal secretions, and milk. Sharing food and water dishes, using the same litterbox, mutual grooming, and bite wounds are all possible methods of transmission. Infected queens can infect fetuses during pregnancy. Infected queens can infect neonates when the babies drink the infected milk. Transmission can also happen via blood transfusions or contaminated needles/instruments. Disease There are four separate classes of infection: abortive, regressive, latent, and progressive. Are There Clinical Signs? There are no specific clinical signs associated with this disease. FeLV infection can lead to several distinct types of syndromes, including: Because the disease impacts many systems, if a previously untested cat doesn't respond to the normal/usual treatment for a disease process, your veterinarian may consider that FeLV could be hampering recovery and will recommend testing. Diagnostic Tests Necessary diagnostic tests may include blood chemistry, hematology, radiography, bone marrow aspiration, ophthalmoscopy, and specialized antibody tests. Treatment There is no effective treatment for the myeloproliferative (bone marrow) form of leukemia. Treatment is mainly supportive and may require blood transfusions, prednisone, and anabolic steroids.FeLV cancer (lymphoma) has a better response to therapy than myeloproliferative diseases do. Treatment may include chemotherapy, glucocorticoids, interferon, Protein A, and supportive treatment. Prognosis The prognosis for infected cats is highly variable. It depends upon the specific disease the cat gets during the course of infection and the availability of supportive treatment for secondary infections. A small percentage of FeLV-positive cats may remain healthy for several years, but the prognosis for persistently FeLV-positive cats is poor, as most of the infected cats living within cluster households will die within three years from the time of diagnosis. Prevention Of FeLV There are several preventive measures that can be taken to decrease the risk of contracting FeLV. Routine testing, as well as vaccination of cats determined to be at risk, are key factors in FeLV prevention. Notes Retroviruses are unstable, live for only minutes outside the cat's body, and are readily destroyed by most disinfectants. Because the feline leukemia virus is so unstable, a new, healthy cat can be brought safely into a "contaminated" house within days of the departure of an FeLV-infected cat. Public Health Implications FeLV has been the subject of many studies. Although human infection with FeLV might be possible, no human has ever been known to become infected with FeLV. Also, no human leukemia has ever been traced back to FeLV infection. Currently, FeLV in cats is not regarded as a human health hazard.

Category: Giardia in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English See the article summary below. What areGiardia? Giardiaare single-celled organisms, infectious to many types of animals (including humans) all over the world. As you can see in the above image,Giardiaorganisms have little whip-like tentacles called flagella that classify them as flagellates. They use their flagella to move around from place to place, but when they find a spot where they wish to stay (like a cozy nook in the host's intestine), they use a suction cup-like structure (visible in the image) to attach. Their presence in the host intestine can cause diarrhea, though some hosts are symptom-free carriers. Different types ofGiardiainfect different types of animals; it is rare forGiardiafrom apet to transmit to a human; furthermore, dog and catGiardiaspecies are separate and are unlikely to cross from dog to cat or vice versa. Giardia have two forms: the trophozoite and the cyst. The trophozoite is the form that lives within the host, swimming around and attaching with its suction cup. The cyst, however, is the form that lives out in the environment. Trophozoites round up to cysts as they approach the colon and then are passed in feces. Trophozoites that don't round up into cysts and form a shell prior to passing into the cold, cruel world cannot withstand the temperature/moisture variability of the outside world. Cysts are the contagious stage. Trophozoites are in the parasitic stage. Life as aGiardiaOrganism As mentioned, trophozoites and cysts may be passed in fresh feces, but only the hard-shelled little cysts can withstand the conditions of the outside world. The cysts live in the environment (outside the host's body) potentially for months until they are consumed by a host. Inside the host, the cyst's shell is digested away, releasing two trophozoites into the intestine, and the cycle begins again. Contaminated water is the classical source of aGiardiainfection. When a fecal sample is analyzed, the appearance of theGiardiaorganism depends on whether the sample is freshly obtained or if it has been outside of the host's body for a while.Giardiaorganisms begin to round up into cysts in a matter of hours. The active trophozoites rather look like funny faces with the two nuclei forming the eyes and median bodies forming the mouth. Cysts look a bit more generic. In the environment, cysts survive in water and soil as long as it is relatively cool and wet. A host animal will accidentally swallow a cyst when drinking from a puddle, or toilet, or when licking fur. After the cyst has been swallowed, the cyst's shell is digested away, freeing the two trophozoites that go forth and attach to the intestinal lining. As mentioned, the trophozoitewill swim to a spot using its flagella and attach with its suction cup (more correctly called its "ventral disc").Trophozoitestend to live in different intestinal areas in different host species but will move to other areas depending on the diet the host is eating. Thetrophozoitemay round itself up and form a cyst while still inside the host's body. If the host has diarrhea, bothtrophozoitesand cysts may be shed in diarrhea; either form can be found in fresh stool. After infection, it takes 5 to 12 days in dogs or 5 to 16 days in cats forGiardiato be found in the host’s stool. Diarrhea can precede the shedding of theGiardia. Infection is more common in kennel situations where animals are housed in groups. How DoesGiardiaCause Diarrhea? No one is completely sure, but infection seems to cause problems with normal intestinal absorption of vitamins and other nutrients. Diarrhea is generally not bloody with aGiardiainfection. Immune-suppressive medications, such as corticosteroids, can re-activate an oldGiardiainfection. We do not know why some infected hosts get diarrhea while others never do. Diagnosis In the past, diagnosis was difficult. The stool sample being examined needed to be fresh, plusGiardiararely show up on the usual fecal testing methods used to detect other parasites. Several tricks have been developed to makeGiardiaeasier to find (special stains, using special processing solutions, etc.), but what has made the biggest difference in the diagnosis ofGiardiais the ELISA test kit, which is similar in format to a home pregnancy test. This method has dramatically improved the ability to detectGiardiainfections and the test can be completed in just a few minutes while you wait. Giardiashed organisms intermittently and may be difficult to detect. Sometimes pets must be retested in order to find an infection, and asymptomatic carrier animals are common. It should also be mentioned that the ELISA test can remain positive for some time after the infection has been eradicated so if re-testing is desired after a positive test, another test format may be more helpful than the ELISA test kit. Treatment A broad-spectrum dewormer calledfenbendazole(Panacur®) seems to be the most reliable treatment at this time.Metronidazole(Flagyl®) has been a classical treatment forGiardiabut studies show it to only be effective in 67% of cases. For some resistant cases, both medications are used concurrently. Febantel is also commonly used forGiardiaas it is converted to fenbendazole in the body. Because cysts can stick to the fur of the infected patient and be a source for re-infection, the positive animal should receive a bath at least once in the course of treatment. At the least, the patient should have a bath at the end of treatment, plus it is especially important to promptly remove infected fecal matter to minimize environmental contamination. Can Humans Be Infected? The short answer is only rarely, so the concern is pretty low in general. However, maintain good hygiene practices such as regular hand-washing and removing fresh pet fecal matter promptly, as mentioned. That said, here is a more detailed answer:Giardia duodenalisis classified into several subcategories called assemblages and designated A through G. Some assemblages are specific as to which host animals they can infect, and other assemblages are not so picky. Assemblage F, for example, only infects cats, and assemblages C and D only infect dogs but assemblage A will infect dogs, cats, people, rodents, wild mammals, and cattle. Common testing methods do not indicate what assemblage has been detected, so there is always a possibility of human transmission as long as the assemblage is unknown. Environmental Decontamination Giardiacysts are killed in the environment by freezing temperatures and by direct sunlight. If neither of these is practical for the area to be disinfected, a chemical disinfectant will be needed. Organic matter such as dirt or stool is protective of the cyst, so on a concrete surface, do basic cleaning before disinfecting. Quaternary ammonia compounds can be used to killGiardiacysts. Animals should be thoroughly bathed before being reintroduced into a clean area. A properly chlorinated swimming pool should not be able to become contaminated. As for areas with lawns or plants, decontamination will not be possible without killing the plants and allowing the area to dry out in direct sunlight. A Footnote on Vaccination A vaccine againstGiardiawas previously available, not to prevent infection in a vaccinated pet but to reduce the shedding of cysts by the vaccinated patient. In other words, the vaccine was designed to reduce the contamination of a kennel whereGiardiawas expected to be a problem. This would be helpful during an outbreak in a shelter or rescue situation but is not particularly helpful to the average dog whose owner wants to simply prevent infection. Because of the limited usefulness of the vaccine, manufacturing was discontinued in 2009. In Summary: Additional information from the Companion Animal Parasite Counsel (CAPC): DrontalPlus® is effective in treating Giardia in dogs when administered per label directions. CAPC Board majority opinion is that asymptomatic dogs may not require treatment.

Category: Heartworm Infection in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Do Cats Get Heartworm? The answer to this question is an unequivocal yes, but feline heartworm disease is a lung disease rather than a heart disease as it is in dogs. The parasite is the same but because the heartworm's natural host is not a cat, the interaction between worm and host creates a very different condition. It isn't good for either the cat nor is it good for the worm. When Heartworm Meets Cat: The Biology The story begins with a mosquito, just as in the canine situation. The mosquito feeds on a heartworm-infected dog, the heartworm microfilaria (the youngest larvae) are sipped up into the mosquito during feeding, and develop in the mosquito's body for the next couple of weeks. This is all according to the plan for the heartworm's life cycle until the mosquito bites a cat instead of another dog. In the third stage, larval heartworms enter the cat's body and develop in the tissues. The feline body is an inhospitable host and worm development is fraught with immunological attack. By the time the larva has reached its 5th stage, it is on its way to the pulmonary arteries to complete its maturation but most infections will end here as the feline immune system is nearly relentless in its assault. At best, only about 25% of the original infecting larvae will survive to adulthood, which means most infections are aborted in this last stage of larval development. Most cats with adult heartworms only have a few worms (1-3 on average) and development to the adult stage takes an extra couple of months in the feline body compared to the canine body. Chances are that there will be a single sex worm population rendering worm reproduction impossible. Only about 20% of feline infections produce microfilaria (youngest worm larvae); further, the feline immune system is so aggressive that the larvae only live a matter of weeks whereas they can live for up to 2 years in a dog. When the adult/parent worm dies inside the cat, a huge amount of inflammation is generated, and many cats do not survive this stage. If the cat does survive, there is likely long-term damage to the lung tissue. It is unclear what percentage of an area's feline population will be infected. The standard statistic is that a region's feline incidence will be approximately 10% of the canine incidence but this appears to be a low estimation since feline infection cannot be defined by the presence of adult worms. It turns out that heartworm disease in cats is not really comparable to the canine disease. In dogs, the disease is vascular (adult heartworms cause trouble by plugging up the pulmonary arteries and generating inflammation there). Adult heartworms make it to the dog's pulmonary arteries after a long maturation process that starts with a tiny larva being deposited adjacent to a mosquito bite in a tiny droplet of mosquito saliva. The baby heartworms do not cause much trouble in dogs and it is not until they have reached substantial size and final location that they are problems. In cats, heartworm disease is more frequently a lung disease and not a vascular disease at all. It is the baby worms that cause all the trouble in feline heartworm disease. If we consider that most feline heartworm disease is from immature worms, the 10% statistic becomes substantially higher. Heartworm disease in cats can produce an assortment of clinical pictures: How many cats are infected without symptoms? The answer is not clear because it is the symptomatic cats that get the most medical scrutiny. Heartworm-Associated Respiratory Disease, or “HARD” Also known as Pulmonary Larval Dirofilariasis As stated, cats are not a natural host for the heartworm, which means the migrating larval heartworms are not likely to complete their life cycle. To recap from above, baby heartworms called microfilaria are sucked up by the mosquito feeding on an infected dog. The ingested young heartworms must spend enough time (several weeks) in themosquito'sbody to develop into an infective stage, at which point they are ready to infect a new host. The infective stage heartworm larva is deposited in a drop of mosquito spit adjacent to a mosquito bite, the larvae crawl into the skin puncture made by the mosquito, gain access to their new host, and continue to develop in the soft tissues of the new host, eventually making their way into the circulation and to the host's pulmonary arteries. The migrating young worm uses molecular signposts to tell it how to get to its host’s pulmonary arteries where it wants to finish growing up, mate, and live out its life. The worm is prepared to read CANINE signposts and does not always migrate correctly trying to understand feline protein signals. The worm may get lost and end up who knows where in the body.If the young worms get to the pulmonary arteries at all, most of them are killed by the especially reactive feline immune response against them. It is this immune reaction that causes heartworm disease in cats and it can start as soon as 75-90 days after the infecting mosquito bite. When young heartworms die in the pulmonary arteries, the immune system breaks them into fragments and attempts to remove them. The resulting inflammation leads to lung disease which manifests as coughing, respiratory effort, and vomiting.The inflammation associated with the death of fifth-stage heartworm larvae is vastly compounded should a coexisting adult heartworm die. In this situation, yet more inflammation results, and even if the cat survives, all this inflammation creates permanent damage in the delicate lung tissues. HARD mimicsfeline asthmaand the two diseases look identical on radiographs. Cats with HARD will cough, wheeze (a musical respiratory sign similar to a sigh), and vomit (though it may be hard to tell aggressive productive coughing from vomiting). Breathing may be shallow and rapid and may progress to actual respiratory distress. Heartworm testing is the only way to distinguish these conditions. Vascular Disease is Separate from HARD While in most situations feline heartworm disease is a lung disease and not a vascular disease as it is in dogs, sometimes cats do get adult worms in their pulmonary arteries just as dogs do. These adult worms do not live as long as they do in the canine body and they do not achieve the same length/size. If they find a mate and give birth to microfilariae, the microfilariae are promptly killed by the feline immune system within the first month. In short, in the feline pulmonary artery, heartworms are much smaller. You would think this would make for milder vascular disease, but because cats are so small even one adult worm takes up a great deal of space in the vasculature. The more usual lung disease is all the worse if the reaction against the immature worms is complicated by a surviving adult worm in the vasculature. When this parasite finally dies, the subsequent blood clots and inflammation is frequently fatal to cats. Most heartworm disease in cats is caused by the inflammatory reaction generated by the worm. In dogs, heartworm disease is mostly about the obstruction of blood flow from the physical size of the worms. Symptoms of Disease The cat's immune system is extremely reactive against heartworms. For this reason, it is virtually impossible to detect microfilariae in an infected cat (their immune system removes them too quickly). Also, symptoms of infection tend to be more immune-related than heart failure-related. Cats develop more of a lung disease, complete with respiratory distress, and chronic coughing or vomiting. Feline heartworm disease is often misdiagnosed as feline asthma. Sudden death may occur just as it may occur in infected dogs. In cats, there are two phases where the disease can exert symptoms. The first is when immature worms reach the lung and pulmonary arteries, as early as 75 to 90 days after infection. Even small worms are inflammatory and disruptive to circulation. Cells of inflammation infiltrate the lung and interfere with the cat’s ability to breathe. The second phase where problems can occur is when the worm dies. Since cats are not the natural host for this parasite, most immature worms that make it to the lung are killed. The presence of the dead worm is extremely inflammatory. (Imagine your body trying to remove or digest the dead body of another animal inside your lung and circulation!) The effects of this kind of widespread inflammation may reach far beyond the lung and circulatory system. The kidney can be affected as well as the gastrointestinal tract and even the nervous system. Heartworm disease is primarily a lung disease in cats, not a heart disease. Diagnostic Testing Antigen TestingIn dogs, diagnosis is usually not complicated. A blood sample is tested for proteins that can only be found on the skin of the adult female heartworm. Most infected dogs have a population of worms in their arteries, so if even one female worm is present an antigen test will show positive. In cats, disease is caused by immature worms, not adult worms female or otherwise, so this kind of testing has limited applications. There may be only a couple of male worms or no adult worms at all to generate a positive antigen test, yet the cat is infected. Microfilaria TestingIn dogs, testing for microfilariae (offspring of adult heartworms born in the host’s body) are also commonly performed. Unfortunately, in cats, microfilaria testing is virtually worthless. First, infected cats usually do not have enough adult worms for the production of offspring. There may be only a few adult worms; single-sex infection is common. Further, microfilariae, if any, are simply cleared too quickly by the host's immune system and are rarely detected. As mentioned, in cats heartworm disease stems at least in part from migrating immature larvae. No adult worms (and thus no off-spring) are necessary for disease so microfilariae testing is not worthwhile in cats. Antibody TestingAntibody testing may be more sensitive but is not adequate alone. A negative antibody test is good evidence that the cat is not infected; however, a positive antibody test may indicate several things. It could indicate a mature infection with one or more adult worms, immature worms in the body, or a past infection. (Antibody levels will remain somewhat elevated after the heartworms have long since died.) So if no single test is reliable, what are we supposed to do for testing? First of all, unlike dogs where annual screening is the norm, healthy cat screening is probably not necessary. Instead, testing is best done if a cat is sick and heartworm disease is suspected. There is still some controversy about what testing should be accomplished in a symptomatic cat. Both antibody and antigen tests in combination are recommended by some experts, while others feel the antibody test alone is probably adequate. Of course, a cat with respiratory disease probably should have chest radiographs and cardiac echocardiography to further define the condition at hand. Treatment Since the major signs of disease in the cat are due to inflammation and immune stimulation, a medication such asprednisolonecan be used to control symptoms. A bacteria calledWolbachiacommonly live within the heartworm and enhances its ability to generate inflammation. A course of doxycycline is often recommended to address these bacteria. The doxycycline course is short but the prednisolone will most likely be a several-week course that may be repeated. If the cat does not appear sick, the American Heartworm Society recommends attempting to wait out the adult worm's 2-3 year lifespan and simply monitor chest radiographs every 6 months or so. The median survival time is 1.5 years for heartworm infection in cats. Radiographs are monitored to check progress. One might wonder why we cannot use the same treatment as we do for dogs to kill any adult heartworms a cat might have. Actually, the same heartworm adulticide therapy used in dogs is best not used in cats as it is extremely dangerous to do so and is considered a last resort. There may not be a choice, however, depending on the degree of illness from the heartworm disease. Approximately one-third of cats receiving heartworm adulticide therapy will experience life-threatening embolic complications when the worms die suddenly (generally an unacceptable statistic). One month of cage confinement is typically recommended to control circulatory effort after adulticide treatment and adulticide therapy should be considered the last resort for an infected cat where symptoms of the disease cannot be controlled with prednisone. Prevention In studies of infected cats, 25% of infected cats were consideredindoor-only cats.Because of this and the disastrous effect of even one heartworm to a cat, the American Heartworm Society recommends monthly prevention forall catsliving in heartworm-endemic areas. Read theirfeline guidelines. The good news is that feline heartworm infection is preventable and there are currently four medications on the market that are reliably effective. Ivermectin The dose of ivermectin (the active ingredient of Heartgard) needed to prevent heartworm infection in cats is about four times higher than in dogs. Heartgard was the first FDA-approved heartworm prevention medication available for cats. It is a monthly flavored chewable available by prescription. Milbemycin Oxime Interceptor® also makes a monthly chewable for cats with the same active ingredient (milbemycin oxime) as Interceptor for dogs. Interceptor for cats also protects againsthookwormsandroundworms. Milbemax is similar but addspraziquantelfor regulartapewormremoval. Selamectin Revolution® entered the anti-parasite scene in 1999. This product covers fleas, roundworms, hookworms, and ear mites in addition to preventing heartworm in cats. Revolution Plus is a more recent update with enhanced flea and tick control. Either form of Revolution is an effective heartworm preventive. These products are applied topically rather than orally. Moxidectin Advantage Multi® combines imidacloprid for flea control and moxidectin for heartworm prevention in one product. This product is also applied topically. It covers roundworms, hookworms, andear mitesas well as heartworm.  Similarly, Bravecto Plus® combines fluralaner for fleas and ticks with moxidectin for worm prevention. This product also covers the same parasites as Advantage Multi plus ticks. For more information, see theAmerican Heartworm Society.

Category: Herpes Viral Conjunctivitis: A Feline Problem
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The conjunctival membranes of the eye are basically the pink part under the eyelids and the lining of the eyelids themselves. When they are irritated, they redden and can become itchy, dry, and uncomfortable. The cornea, or clear dome-like covering of the eye, can become involved in the inflammation. It can become cloudy or even ulcerated. Tear production can be reduced, leading to a chronically dry, uncomfortable eye. Conjunctivitis in cats is typically of viral origin, and usually, that means a herpesvirus (feline herpesvirus-1 to be specific) infection. Herpesviruses grow in the tissues of the body that interface with the environment, such as the upper respiratory tissues and conjunctivae. The infection begins with an initial phase that is usually the most severe in terms of symptoms. This phase resolves, but the virus itself does not go away; instead, it retreats into the neurologic structure in the head called the trigeminal ganglion, where the patient’s immune system holds it prisoner. In times of stress, the immune system is taxed, and the virus is able to escape from the ganglion, traveling out via the nerves exiting the ganglion. The result is the return of symptoms. In this way, the infection is permanent but the symptoms of the infections come and go. Symptoms include conjunctivitis as described above but also nasal and respiratory symptoms such as sniffles, runny nose, and fever, basically the symptoms of anupper respiratory infection. As mentioned, the first episode is generally the worst, and subsequent episodes are more mild. Recovery typically begins after 10-14 days of symptoms, and the episode resolves within three weeks. The virus is spread by close contact (usually direct contact) with an infected cat. Herpes virus is very contagious among cats, which means that infection is very common even in cats with no symptoms. As mentioned, the first episode is generally the worst, and subsequent episodes are more mild. Baby Kittens: A Special Situation Herpes infection is a special problem in young kittens, especially those facing stresses beyond just their young age (fleas, poor nutrition, environmental cold, etc.). Feral kittens, waifs of the streets, outdoor kittens, shelter kittens, etc., are all at high risk for herpes infection. Young kittens can produce so much ocular discharge that their eyes gum closed, sealing the infected secretions around the eye. It is important that the eyelids be opened manually to allow drainage of secretions as well as the application of medicine. The swelling of the conjunctivae can be so severe that the eye itself is not visible.In severe cases, the eye can rupture and become permanently blinded. Treatment is crucial, and response to topical therapy is usually dramatic. As mentioned, herpes infection typically causes respiratory signs as well: snotty nose, congestion, etc. These signs can result in life-threatening loss of appetite and dehydration in a young kitten, while signs are generally minor in an adult cat whose immune system is mature. Kittens with obvious discomfort should be examined by a veterinarian. Oral antibiotics will most likely be needed and sometimes hospitalization is also necessary for proper supportive care. Adult Cats Since kittens are so commonly affected with herpes, it is not unusual to find oneself in possession of an adult cat with a history of herpes infection. These individuals will have recurring conjunctivitis in times of stress. Typical signs include squinting slightly in one eye, a noticeable increase in eye discharge (usually brownish in color), redness of the conjunctivae, or all of the above. How do we Know it is Herpes? Basically, any infection that creates an upper respiratory infection will also cause conjunctivitis; herpes is not the only such infection. Often, several agents of upper respiratory infection are active in the same cat at the same time. The chances are that it will not be worthwhile to determine which agents are there; it is more practical to treat bacterial agents and secondary bacterial infections first and then see if antiviral medications turn out to be needed. Right now, the most sensitive test for herpes is PCR testing. This test is able to detect even small amounts of herpes DNA and is much more sensitive than the prior form of testing, which involved antibody levels. The problem is that herpes infection is so extremely common that most cats in any given area are going to test positive, indicating they are harboring the virus in their bodies. Having a herpes infection is not the same as having an active herpes infection, so testing a cat will determine if the cat is harboring herpes but will not determine if herpes is presently active. So, how do we know it's herpes? We probably will not know for sure without a test but if a stressed cat has conjunctivitis involving the cornea, the chances are that herpes is afoot. How Can we Treat it? There are several treatment methods that can be combined in the treatment of feline herpes eye infections. Topical AntibioticsTopical antibiotics quell secondary bacterial invaders and are helpful in controlling the severity of symptoms because secondary bacterial infections frequently complicate Herpes conjunctivitis. It is important to realize that antibiotics do not affect the herpesvirus itself; they only work on secondary bacteria; however, often, this is enough to make the cat comfortable until the virus goes dormant. Topical Anti-viralsThere are several eye drops available that act directly against the herpes virus. They include idoxuridine (no longer commercially available and must be obtained from a compounding pharmacy); Viroptic® (trifluorothymidine); cidofovir (which also must be obtained through a compounding pharmacy), and Vira-A® (vidarabine). These medications are relatively expensive and typically require administration five times daily with the exception of cidofovir, which accumulates in the eye tissues and allows for twice daily dosing. This sounds great, but there are some toxicity issues to be reviewed if one is truly contemplating this latter therapy. Oral Anti-virals While antibiotics have been around for decades, antiviral medications have been much more elusive.Famciclovirwas developed as a herpes treatment for humans and has been found effective for feline herpes as well. While doses and protocols are still being worked out, higher doses of oral famciclovir translate into therapeutic famciclovir levels secreted in tears, effectively creating a topical treatment from an oral product. Because the topical antivirals are frequently inconvenient to use, oral famciclovir combined with a topical antibiotic makes a fair approach to feline herpes conjunctivitis. It should be noted that some infections lend themselves to prevention by the vaccination process, and others do not. Herpes does not; this means that vaccination of healthy cats does not prevent infection for feline herpes; what it does do is lead to less severe signs. Vaccination against feline herpes has been deemed helpful but one should understand that, in this case, the goal is not total prevention of infection but palliation. Eosinophilic Keratitis: A Possible Result of Chronic Infection An especially unpleasant possible outcome of feline herpes infection involves thick white plaques forming on the surface of the eye. A scraping from the plaque can be examined under the microscope for white blood cells called eosinophils, and if they are found, the diagnosis of eosinophilc keratitis is confirmed. The plaques are an inappropriate immunologic reaction to the virus, so immune suppressive topical medications are needed to suppress the reaction. Life-long treatment is typically necessary. Corneal Sequestrum: Another Possible Result of Chronic Infection The Persian breed appears to be particularly predisposed to this reaction to the herpes virus. Here, a section of the cornea actually dies and turns black or dark brown. The fastest route to resolution involves surgical removal of the dead tissue and application of a tissue graft. Not all veterinarians are comfortable doing this surgery, or have the necessary equipment, so discuss with your veterinarian whether a referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist is in your and your pet’s best interest. Non-surgical management is possible with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory topicals but a specialist is best consulted should this complication of infection arise. Can Humans get Feline Herpes? Can Cats get Human Herpes? Thankfully, humans and cats cannot share their herpes viruses. Feline herpes is contagious among cats only, and human herpes is contagious among humans only.

Category: How Toxoplasmosis Affects Your Cat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Toxoplasmosis? Toxoplasmosis is the name of the clinical disease caused by the parasiteToxoplasma gondii. It is most often associated with cats but can infect all warm-blooded species including humans. It is a zoonotic disease, which is an infectious disease or condition that can be passed between animals and humans. Zoonotic refers to zoonosis, which is a Greek term meaning "animal sickness". You have probably heard the warnings given to pregnant women about cleaning litterboxes and the dangers of ingesting raw/undercooked meat or milk products. But should you be concerned about how this parasite affects your cat? Any questions or concerns about toxoplasmosis and its effects on humans should be addressed with your physician. How Does My Cat Get This? T. gondiiis carried by many animals, but cats are the only definitive host (where the parasite reaches the adult stage and is able to reproduce). Other animals have a specific enzyme that prevents the parasite from maturing. Infected prey animals, raw meat, and soil can hold tissue cysts calledoocysts,which are egg-like structures containing millions of immatureT. gondii.When your cat ingests the parasite by eating an already infected animal or picking it up from infected soil, theoocyststransform into developing tissue calledtachyzoites. Thesetachyzoitescan pass to different areas of the body, including muscles, the heart, and other organs. How Will I Know if My Cat Has Toxoplasmosis? An otherwise healthy cat might not develop or display any signs. Cats with weakened immune systems, pregnant cats, and young kittens are the most susceptible. Pregnant cats can pass the parasite to their unborn, resulting in complications that include genetic abnormalities, weak or small kittens, or loss of the pregnancy. The most common signs a cat with an infection might show include depression, acting tired or listless, or appearing to have muscle or stomach pain. Your cat may have a cough, a fever, stop eating, or have a bloated abdomen, along with vomiting and diarrhea. Eyesight problems or inflammation of the eyes might be present. As previously stated, the infection caused by the parasite can involve internal organs, and respiratory infections are common. In a study of cat breeds, Persian, Birman, Ocicat (a domestic breed that has coat markings resembling an ocelot), and Norwegian Forest cats were four to seven times more likely to have positive results when testing for toxoplasmosis. Both male and female cats can be affected by the parasite. How Is Toxoplasmosis Diagnosed? Based on the signs your cat is having, blood work, fecal sample analysis, tissue biopsy, urinalysis, and serum titer tests may be carried out by your veterinarian. More serious cases may require more extensive testing, including radiographs (X-rays) and eye examinations. What if My Cat is a Hunter But Isn’t Sick? Although this parasite is common, not all cats will get infected. And even if they do, most healthy cats do not become seriously ill. After exposure,oocystscan shed for several weeks. A healthy cat can live with the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis for years and you may never know it. Because the tissue cysts that cause toxoplasmosis are not easily destroyed, the parasite can remain with your cat and become active again in the future, with or without illness. Cats that are otherwise healthy tend to have better outcomes. How Is It Treated? Antibiotics will likely be prescribed. If your cat is on any type of immunosuppressive medication, it will most likely be stopped. Supportive therapy and proper medication for any symptoms will be recommended, as appropriate. Cats can begin to show improvement within 1-2 days of treatment. Depending on the seriousness of a cat’s infection, a full recovery is possible. Keeping litterboxes clean, not allowing your cat to hunt in the yard, and not feeding raw diets will help. At the time of this writing, studies for vaccinations against toxoplasmosis are not complete, and a vaccination is not yet available.

Category: Rabies in Animals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   Click here for a summary. Descriptions of rabies go back thousands of years as rabies has classically been one of the most feared infections of all time. It is because of this fear that dog ownership requires a license and documentation of rabies vaccination. There is still no reliably effective treatment for rabies infection once symptoms have started. The virus does not survive outside of the infected host very long, so direct contact with fresh secretions is required for transmission.  In most cases, the disease is transmitted via a bite wound and it is mostly wildlife that gets infected. When wildlife starts coming into contact with the pet population, then pets become infected and when pets get infected, human infection is not far behind. Because this infection has nearly 100% mortality, preventing it in pets becomes crucial to preventing it in people. Of course, people can get infected by wildlife contact as well. Despite vaccination being readily available, every year the U.S. reports approximately 50 canine deaths, 250 feline deaths, and several human deaths from rabies. Worldwide, some 55,000 human deaths occur annually from rabies even now in the 21st century. The most common wildlife species to spread rabies to domestic animals and humans in the Northern Hemisphere are skunks, bats, raccoons, foxes, and coyotes. Wildlife (especially bats) can gain access to indoor areas where they can come in close contact with both pets and people. Indoor pets are not without risk. Many people do not realize how fast death occurs from rabies. While it may take a long time for the virus to incubate, once even mild symptoms begin, death occurs within 10 days. The injection treatment most people have heard of only works during the incubation period;once symptoms have started, survival chances are slim. The Course of the Disease The virus in the infected animal's saliva enters the victim's tissues during the bite. The virus attaches to the local muscle cells for a couple of days before penetrating local nerves and beginning its slow ascent to the brain. Once within nervous tissue, the virus is not accessible to the immune system and may safely proceed toward the brain. The journey is slow and can take up to a year but the average time is three to eight weeks depending on the species. Virus ultimately reaches the brain and in two to three days more is evident in all body secretions, including saliva. At this point, the disease becomes transmissible and symptoms begin. It can take up to a year from the time of the initial bite before symptoms begin to show.In dogs, typical incubation periods are 21-80 days.In cats, it's 28-42 days.Once symptoms show, treatment is nearly impossible. Prodromal Stage (The First 2-3 Days After Symptoms Have Started)A personality change is noted. Friendly animals become shy, etc. The larynx begins to spasm and a voice change may be noted (especially true in rabid cattle). Most infected animals will actively lick or scratch the site of the original bite. Excitative Stage (Next 1-7 Days) Classically, this would be the "mad dog" stage, though, in reality, most animals skip this phase altogether. The animal has no fear and suffers from hallucinations. If confined, the animal often attacks the bars of the cage. Paralytic or Dumb Stage (Next 2-4 Days) Weakness/paralysis sets in. The larynx is paralyzed, resulting in an inability to swallow, thus drooling and "foaming at the mouth" result. The animal dies when the intercostal muscles that control breathing are paralyzed. It is from animals in this stage where most human exposure occurs. There is no treatment for animals or humans once clinical signs appear. Once the virus has been released to body secretions, it is again accessible to the immune system; however, the patient dies before an adequate immune response is mounted. The classical symptoms of rabies described above may not be recognizable, making diagnosis difficult if not impossible in a living animal. Long quarantines are often needed to determine if the infection has occurred. When human exposure to the animal in question is involved, what happens depends on several criteria. If the animal in question is dead, its brain can be tested for rabies. There is no test for rabies in a living animal but since we know that death follows quickly after the virus becomes contagious, a living animal can be confined for 10 days. If the animal is still alive 10 days after biting a person, then the bite could not have transmitted rabies.  Prevention For Our Pets Happily, rabies prevention is accomplished with vaccination and limiting exposure to wildlife. The standard killed virus vaccines are available for both dogs and cats and, after the initial dose which is good for one year, subsequent doses are generally good for three years. Because tumors have developed in cats who received the killed virus vaccine, a recombinant product is now available that uses a portion of rabies viral DNA cloned into a harmless canarypox virus. This arrangement allows the pet to realize the benefits of live virus vaccination without any risk of exposure to the living rabies virus. Rabies vaccination protocols are typically controlled by municipal regulations. Most communities legally require the vaccination of all dogs. TheAmerican Association of Feline Practitionersrecommends rabies vaccination as a core vaccine for all pet cats. For pets not current on rabies vaccination that have been exposed to biting wildlife, the Texas Post-Exposure Rabies Prophylaxis Protocol has been particularly helpful. In this situation, the pet should be vaccinated for rabies as soon as possible after the wildlife bite with booster vaccines given three weeks post-bite and eight weeks post-bite. The pet should be strictly isolated for 90 days. This protocol has been extremely successful in preventing rabies symptoms and contagion when normal rabies vaccination had lapsed. Treatment for Humans (Post Exposure Prophylaxis or PEP) As mentioned, once symptoms have started, treatment can be attempted but truly there is little chance of survival. The only way to survive rabies is to exploit the long incubation period and basically get vaccinated quickly. Doing this involves a very big piece of information: knowing you were (or may have been) exposed. Every year a small number of people die of rabies in the U.S. Most of these people were bitten by a dog, bat, or some other animal and did nothing other than basic first aid. Recall that it takes many weeks for the rabies virus to reach the brain. This allows time for the vaccine to be given so that when the virus "comes out" of its neurologic hiding place and is ready to infect the brain, a substantial immunologic response is waiting. The virus is foiled and clinical rabies does not result. If you are bitten by an animal and its rabies vaccination history is unknown, there are definite steps to take. A fresh bite wound should be washed out with water quickly as this may wash out viral particles. The time it takes for the virus to reach the brain depends on the amount of virus and how close the wound is to the head. This simple step can be life-saving. If the biting animal is alive, its vaccination status should be confirmed as soon as possible and it will need to be confined according to local law. The bite wound should be reported to the health department as soon as possible. Only rodent and rabbit bites are not reportable. If the animal is dead then its brain can be tested for rabies. The head of the biting animal is submitted to the health department for fluorescent antibody testing for the rabies virus. This process takes a matter of hours so that any bite victims can know right away if they will require rabies treatment. If the animal is not available or its vaccination status is in question, further treatment may be needed. Hyperimmune (antibody-rich) serum is flushed into the wound in the hope of inactivating the virus before it penetrates the nerves. The patient receives a vaccination on a regular schedule for about a month, as described above. Veterinarians have a rabies exposure risk of more than 300 times that of the general population. Anyone pursuing a career with animals should consider vaccination against rabies. The Law Regarding Animal Bites (Against Humans) In the U.S., states and counties have different regulations regarding rabies vaccines for companion animals and bites to humans. Regulations for your area in the U.S. can be found through your county's health department. In almost all states in the U.S., the biting animal must be confinedfor observationfor 10 days at the owner's expense regardless of vaccination status. The purpose of the quarantine period is to determine if the rabies virus could have been in the animal's saliva at the time of the bite. An animal infected with rabies and shedding virus will certainly be dead within ten days. If the biting animal is known to have been exposed to wildlife, the situation is different. A vaccinated animal must be re-vaccinated within the time period required by local regulations and confined for observation for the specified duration. Unvaccinated animals may be confined for a specified time period according to local/regional law, or be euthanized and tested for rabies. In the U.S., all bites to humans that break the skin are reportable to local health departments. Rabies vaccination requirements vary from state to state, and country to country.  Contact your veterinarian if you think your pet has come into contact with or been bitten by a wild animal. Regardless of the vaccination status of your pet, wild animal bites may lead to painful wounds and infection. Again, laws regarding biting dogs and rabies vaccination are highly regional.Check with your local animal regulation department, your veterinarian, or visitrabiesaware.orgto find out what you need to know in the U.S.. Quarantines when Traveling Great Britain, Hawaii, Japan, New Zealand, and several other island areas have successfully eradicated rabies from their territory. These places are EXTREMELY cautious about allowing in potential carriers of rabies. Because of the long incubation period of rabies, a very long quarantine is needed; however, this must be balanced by the expense associated with quarantine and owners' reluctance to be separated from their pets. Most places that have eradicated rabies have protocols for avoiding or minimizing quarantine. Typically, a microchip is implanted in the pet for identification purposes, a rabies antibody titer (a measurement of vaccine-induced protection) must be performed at an approved laboratory, and rabies vaccine documentation is necessary. For listings of what each state requires for entry, go to theUSDA. Fortravel to another countrycheck with that country's consulate, but guidelines are also available at USDA. Other Links TheCDC's rabies home pagehas, in addition to basic information, a children's education area that is particularly helpful for families who go camping. The annualWorld Rabies Daycalls attention to this problem to raise awareness and provides information about rabies in both humans and animals.  In Summary: You can’t treat rabies once symptoms set in; all you can do is prevent it. Rabies is a virus transmitted through saliva or brain tissue. Without rapid preventive treatment, it is almostalwaysfatal. That’s why your pets are required to have rabies vaccines in many areas of the world. The most common wildlife species to spread rabies to animals and people in the Northern Hemisphere are bats, skunks, raccoons, foxes, and coyotes. It is generally caused by a bite wound, and mostly wildlife gets infected. Rabies affects a mammal’s central nervous system. It can take up to a year before symptoms begin to show, but the average time is 3-8 weeks depending on the species. In dogs, the typical incubation period is 21-80 days. In cats, it's 28-42 days.Once symptoms begin, treatment is nearly impossible. If you are bitten, you need a preventive injection immediately as it only works during the incubation period. Once even mild symptoms begin, death occurs within 10 days.  After symptoms have started:  Symptoms may not be obviously recognizable, making diagnosis difficult if not impossible. There is no diagnostic test for rabies in a living animal. What happens after people are exposed depends on the situation. If the animal is dead, its head is sent to a laboratory so the brain tissue can be tested. In some circumstances/locations, a living animal can be quarantined for 10 days at the owner’s expense; if the animal is still alive, then the bite could not have transmitted rabies. The vaccine protocols are typically controlled by municipal regulations. Most communities legally require all dogs to be vaccinated and recommend it for cats. Vaccination requirements vary from state to state, and country to country. Exposed pets not current on rabies vaccination should be given booster vaccines at 3 and 8 weeks post-bite. The pet should be strictly isolated for 90 days. Exposed humans should wash the bite with water as it may wash out some virus particles; the time it takes for the virus to reach the brain depends on the amount of virus in addition to how close the wound is to the head.  This step could save a life. Animal bites need to be reported to local health departments. Veterinarians have a rabies exposure risk of more than 300 times that of the general population. Anyone in an animal-oriented job should consider preventive vaccination.Back to top The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Tritrichomonas Infection Causes Diarrhea in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Try-tricko-monas) Kittens and cats living in groups have an assortment of infectious diseases to contend withupper respiratory infections, coronavirus, andcoccidia, to name a few.Tritrichomonasis yet another infectious organism yielding diarrhea in feline patients, usually with a history of group lifestyle. Tritrichomonas foetusis a classic parasitic infection of cattle and in 2003 whenTritrichomonaswas found to be a cause of diarrhea in the cat, it was assumed that this was the same organism. More recently, genetic research has suggested that the feline organism is a different species, and the nameTritrichomonas blagburnicame into play. Years have gone by, and there continue to be arguments over whether these two organisms are actually the same or not. If you are doing your own research, you are likely to find both names used, and it may be confusing. For the purposes of this article, "blagburni" will be used. Information and recommendations regarding this organism have changed in the last several years, and we attempt to provide the most up-to-date summary of what is known and recommended for the prevention and treatment of this infection. What isTritrichomonas blagburniAnyway? Under the microscope,T. blagburniis commonly mistaken forGiardia, another parasitic flagellate as they both use flagella to move around and both have pear-shaped bodies. The treatment for these two parasites is very different so it is especially important to get the diagnosis right which means that a visual identification may be tricky, especially since both organisms may be present at the same time. Fortunately, there are biochemical tests that have made identification much easier as will be described later on. How do Cats get Infected? T. blagburniorganisms are shed in the feces of an infected cat. Most commonly, transmission occurs when cats share a litter box, as the organism can live up to 3 days in fecal material and up to seven days at room temperature. Any time a cat steps in the feces of an infected cat, organisms can be transferred to the paws and later licked up during grooming. What Does it Do to a Cat? T. blagburnicolonizes the lower intestine of the cat causing the mucous and sometimes bloody diarrhea that characterizescolitis. If the colon is biopsied, inflammatory cell infiltration typical ofinflammatory bowel diseasewill be seen. Diarrhea will clear in 88 percent of cats within two years, but the infection will likely persist, and the cat will likely remain contagious to other cats. Because colitis can have so many causes, it is important to keep this possible cause in mind. Chronic colitis may or may not respond to symptomatic treatment and if a specific underlying cause can be identified and treated, a long-term difficult problem can be potentially resolved permanently. Many colitis remedies will lead to temporary improvement for aTritrichomonas-infected cat, but the symptoms generally come right back after treatment ceases. Making the Diagnosis There are four testing methods that can be used to identifyTritrichomonas blagburniin a fecal sample. A very fresh fecal sample is needed for Tritrichomonas testing. This means the sample must be retrieved directly from the anus with no cat litter contamination, flushed from the colon with a syringe, or obtained with a deeply inserted gadget called a fecal loop. Bringing a sample from home will not be adequate. If the cat has been on antibiotics, this will interfere with testing; the cat should be off antibiotics for at least a couple of days. Direct Smear Some fecal matter is swabbed onto a microscope slide, mixed with a gentle saline solution, and examined for flagellate organisms. The feces must be immediately fresh from the rectum. The wetter and more mucous the sample is, the better. Usually, several slides must be examined as the organism is elusive. Standard fecal tests for parasites will not pick up this organism. Refrigeration of the sample will kill the organism and make it impossible to detect. Further, if the patient is on antibiotics the number of organisms available to detect will be greatly reduced even though most antibiotics cannot cure the infection. While this is a relatively easy test to perform, it only has about a 14% chance of detecting a naturalT. blagburniinfection. A more sensitive test is generally preferred. Culture (also called the Pouch Test)A specific culture bag can be used to growT. blagburniin numbers large enough for detection. The feces used must be freshly obtained from the rectum, inoculated into the pouch, and the pouch is kept in a vertical position for 12 days at room temperature. The pouch is periodically examined under the microscope for the presence of organisms. PCR Testing (Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing)PCR testing is a DNA test forT. blagburni. A larger fecal sample is needed and the test should be done at a reference lab. Many experts prefer the pouch test because it is inexpensive, and leave PCR testing for patients where the pouch test has been negative but the index of suspicion is still high. That said, most small hospitals do not have much experience identifyingTritrichomonasunder the microscope so for best accuracy, a better option may be to choose the expertise of the reference laboratory. PCR testing is the most sensitive of all the test methods but is also relatively expensive. Specialized equipment is needed and only a few laboratories are qualified to run samples. BiopsyA routine colon biopsy is unlikely to find this parasite; specific stains on the tissue (immunohistochemistry) must be requested and at least six tissue samples must be examined. This is the most invasive form of testing and would not be done right off the bat but if the patient is going to have a biopsy for chronic colitis anyway, it might be a good idea to have the pathologist look forT. blagburni. A negative test never rules outTritrichomonasinfection, no matter which test is performed. Treatment The only drug that is felt to be reliable againstT. blagburniis ronidazole, and its use is far from straightforward. Here is what to know: In the past, several different antibiotics have been reported to be effective but it turns out that this is probably an overestimate since 88% of cats will resolve their diarrhea spontaneously within 2 years. They will still be infected, or at least 57% of them will be, but they will have normal stools, and they may relapse with stress. One treatment option is to simply wait for resolution if the household does not have a large number of cats and the diarrhea is not excessive.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English See article summary below. Signs What Cats Are at Risk? The agents of feline upper respiratory infection are highly contagious and present wherever cats live in groups. Getting infected is easy; a cat simply must socialize with an infected cat or share the same human caretaker, toys, or food bowls.  It would seem that the average house cat would be at low risk for infection; however, it is important to realize how common upper respiratory infection is. In some areas, the infection rate is felt to be 60% or more. This means that there is an excellent chance that any cat or kitten is already infected at the time of adoption, regardless of whether the cat is showing any symptoms.Kittens are predisposeddue to their immature immune systems and are usually hit the hardest. When these kittens grow up, they are still infected, and symptoms may come out whenever stress suppresses their immune system. Typically, infected cats come from theshelter, areoutdoor cats, or are housed in close contact with lots of other cats (experiencing crowding stress).Persian catsare predisposed to upper respiratory infection due to their inherent facial flattening. The average house cat who is not exposed to any rescued kittens lives with only one or two other cats at most, never goes outside, and leads a non-stressed life is unlikely to break with symptoms but may very well be asymptomatically infected. The chief infectious agents that cause feline upper respiratory infections areherpesvirusandcalicivirus, together accounting for about 90 percent of infections. Other agents include:Chlamydophila, Mycoplasma, Bordetella, and others. Of course, a cat or kitten may be infected with more than one agent. Viruses are spread by the wet sneezes of infected or carrier individuals. The herpesvirus is fragile, surviving only 18 hours outside its host; calicivirus is tougher, lasting up to 30 days. Bleach will readily inactivate either virus but calicivirus is able to withstand unbleached laundry detergents. A cat with herpes is contagious to other cats for a couple of weeks after a stressful event. Cats infected with calici are contagious for several months after infection but do not appear to have recurrences the same way cats with herpes do. Course of Infection To some extent, the combinations of symptoms and course of infection is determined by which of numerous infectious agents is responsible. Ninety percent of feline upper respiratory infections are caused by either feline herpes (also called the rhinotracheitis virus) or feline calicivirus. Neither of these infections is transmissible to humans or to other animals. Most feline colds run a course of 7 to 10 days regardless of treatment but it is important to realize that these infections are permanent and that herpesvirus infections are recurring (a property of all types of herpes infections). In kittens, herpes infections are notorious for dragging out. Stresses such as surgery (usually neutering/spaying), boarding, or introduction of a new feline companion commonly induce a fresh herpes upper respiratory episode about a week following the stressful event and the active virus sheds for another couple of weeks. These episodes may recur for the life of the cat, although as the cat matures, symptoms become less and less severe and ultimately may not be noticeable to the owner. Cats infected with calicivirus may shed virus continuously, not just in times of stress, and may do so for life, although about 50% of infected cats seem to stop shedding virus at some point. A cat with herpes is contagious to other cats for a couple of weeks after a stressful event. Cats infected with calicivirus are contagious for several months after infection but do not appear to have recurrences the same way cats with herpes do. The next most common infectious agents (after herpes and calici) areChlamydophila felis(formerly known asChlamydia psittaci) andBordetella bronchiseptica, both organisms being sensitive to the tetracycline family, such asdoxycycline. When to be Concerned: Signs a Cat Requires Hospitalization A cold for a cat is usually just a nuisance like a cold usually is for humans. Sometimes, though, an upper respiratory infection can be serious. If a cat is sick enough to stop eating or drinking, hospitalization may be needed to get through the brunt of the infection. A cat (usually a kitten) can actually get dehydrated from the fluid lost in nasal discharge. Painful ulcers can form on the eyes, nose or in the mouth, especially if calicivirus is involved. Sometimes fever is high enough to warrant monitoring. In young kittens, pneumonia may result from what started as an upper respiratory infection. There is also a shifting leg lameness (called "limping kitten syndrome") associated with Calici infection. If you think your cat or kitten is significantly uncomfortable with a cold, you should seek veterinary assistance with an office visit. How is this Usually Treated? How an upper respiratory infection is treated depends on how severe it is and whether or not there seems to be a bacterial infection complicating the viral infection. A mildly symptomatic adult cat might need no treatment at all, as the symptoms should naturally wane over one to two weeks. A heavily congested kitten will likely need antibiotics, antivirals, and possibly even hospitalization. Oral medications and/or eye ointments are commonly prescribed. Severely affected cats may need to have inhalational antibiotics, fluids administered intravenously or under the skin to maintain hydration, and/or some sort of assisted feeding. Special Therapies Some cats are severely affected, and addressing the secondary bacterial infection is simply not enough to achieve comfort. For these situations, antiviral medications such asfamciclovircan be used to address the viral infection, and often, even chronic symptoms can be controlled at least temporarily. Cats are too small to meaningfully blow their noses or sneeze out very dry or thick sinus secretions. Oral supplementation with N-Acetylcysteine can be helpful in breaking down this material. Polyprenyl immunostimulant is a biological product made by Vetimmune®currently licensed  by the USDA to treat feline herpes infection. This product is given orally once a day for two weeks and reportedly stimulates cellular immunity (as opposed to antibody-related immunity). More chronically infected cats with severely blocked sinuses can have their sinuses flushed out under anesthesia. This can clear a great deal of material out of the nasal passages but how long results persist is variable. Consult your veterinarian before attempting any sort of home treatment. What are the Vaccination Options? Vaccination is unlikely to be completely preventive for upper respiratory viruses and is instead meant to minimize the severity of the symptoms. In selecting a vaccine against upper respiratory infections, there are some choices. First, choose between a nasal vaccine and an injectable vaccine. The injectable vaccines that typically include feline distemper were developed first, and when vaccines for upper respiratory infections were created they were simply added to the basic distemper injectable vaccine. Since that time, science has developed a more localized form of vaccination to better address more localized types of infections. If you select the injectable route of vaccination, you have to decide if you want a “four in one” or a “three in one” vaccine. You may vaccinate your cat for distemper, herpesvirus, and calicivirus, or you may vaccinate for distemper, herpesvirus, calicivirus, andChlamydophila felis. Because herpes and calicivirus together account for 90% of upper respiratory infections andChlamydophilaaccounts for less than 10% of upper respiratory infections, the American Association of Feline Practitioner vaccination guidelines favor the “three in one” vaccine and consider theChlamydophilavaccine optional. There is some feeling that nasal vaccines may provide a more complete stimulation to the area of the immune system responsible for defense against the infection in question. Nasal vaccination provides protection especially rapidly (3 or 4 days). Herpes and calicivirus vaccines can be given either nasally or by injection. A Few Words about Hemorrhagic Calicivirus A particularly virulent strain of calicivirus, commonly referred to as hemorrhagic calicivirus, has appeared to pop up out of nowhere. While few outbreaks have been reported, it is possible more have occurred and gone unrecognized. Hemorrhagic calicivirus is highly contagious and rapidly fatal. While the infection is rare, you may wish to vaccinate your cat for it and/or discuss this option with your veterinarian. A special vaccine, called “TruFel HC2PCh,” has become available from Elanco.

Category: When You Need Antibiotics for Your Pets, and When You Don’t
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Antibiotics can be literal life savers for your pet when they have the kind of infection that responds to the medication. However, when given for something where they are not appropriate — such as a virus — antibiotics can create a long-lasting problem of antibiotic resistance, lessening the future ability of antibiotics to cure. Using antibiotics for viral illnesses such as colds simply doesn’t do anything to get rid of the cold, but it may create drug-resistant bacteria that are much harder to kill because they no longer respond to typical doses of regular antibiotics. Using large doses of less commonly used antibiotics may not treat the problem either or may simply cause more resistance. Both bacteria and viruses are germs and can make dogs or cats (or people) sick. The two types of germs can cause diseases with similar symptoms, but each one has a different way of multiplying and spreading disease. Diarrhea, for example, can have several different causes, some of which are bacterial, and some are viral. The difference between the two types of germs is that bacteria are living organisms and viruses are not. Bacteria are only single-cell organisms, but they are still considered alive. Viruses are essentially a collection of molecules that work together to replicate, so they only grow and reproduce after they've invaded living cells. Like all other species, their main goal is to replicate. Antibiotics fight living organisms – the bacteria – by killing them or stopping their growth and reproduction, but they can’t do that for viruses. Your own immune system can successfully fight some viruses, but sometimes, such as after catching a common cold, viruses must simply run their course and there is little anyone can do to shorten the time frame. You can treat symptoms such as coughing and headache, but not the disease itself. Your pets are the same way. Many diseases veterinarians see are only viral in nature and that’s the point at which you do not want to give your pet antibiotics. Such viruses include: Some bacterial diseases develop after a virus has made it easier for bacteria to infect. Examples include: Many organs can be infected with bacteria. Bacterial infections include: Taking antibiotics too often or for the wrong reasons can change bacteria so much that antibiotics don't work against them. Giving antibiotics when they are not indicated can have two effects that can profoundly impact the health of your patient. The first is killing healthy bacteria. Not all bacteria are bad, in fact most are probably beneficial. Beneficial bacteria protect from disease-causing bacteria, promote a healthy immune system, and help the body with metabolism. Bacteria in the gut are particularly important, however, bacteria are crucial to the health of many organs. The second effect of antibiotic use is the potential for antibiotic resistance. This means that when a pet has a bacterial infection that could have been treated by antibiotics, the drugs may not be able to help end the infection; your pet will still be sick despite treatment. This can be true if the pet already has received antibiotics, even a different antibiotic.  One example is skin infections.  In some cases, pets can end up with methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus pseudintermedius(MRSP or MRSA).MRSA and MRSPare resistant to numerous drugs and adapt quickly to the immune system, so they are a big concern in the veterinary community. Another common organism that rapidly develops resistance is Escherichia coli, (usually called E. coli), which usually infects the urinary bladder. Your veterinarian understands these risks and may suggest that antibiotics not be used if alternative treatments might be better. Examples include: Thankfully, you can help your pet avoid antibiotic resistance in several ways: The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Cerebellar Hypoplasia Cats Are Clumsy from Birth
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Also known as Spastic Cat Syndrome and Wobbly Cat Syndrome The cat with cerebellar hypoplasia is abnormal from infancy, though it may not be clear that something is wrong until the kittens reach an age when they are expected to have some muscular coordination. The cat with this disease clearly has balance issues: he walks with his legs widely placed for fear of falling and places his feet clumsily. He often leans against walls for support. Sitting still, he may look like a fairly normal cat, but once focused on a toy, food bowl, or friendly hand, tremors begin and get more severe as concentration becomes more intense. Still, despite the obvious impairment, cats with this condition are happy, able to feed themselves and use a litter box, and are felt to have a good quality of life. Your Cerebellum and You The cerebellum is a part of the brain nestled inside the base of the skull, as shown in Image 1. The cerebellum is involved in the involuntary aspects of moving our bodies, whether walking around, reaching for something, or just turning our heads. These all seem like voluntary activities, so it might be difficult to consider that there is something involuntary going on as well. Consider walking across an uneven, perhaps rocky, terrain while carrying on a conversation with another person. Certainly, the decision to move from point A to point B is voluntary but the chances are you can walk across pretty uneven terrain without falling down or even thinking about where to put your feet. You can thank your cerebellum for that. Your cerebellum receives information from your feet as well as from the vestibular apparatus in your middle ear. This information tells you where up and down are and where your body is in relation to up and down. Your cerebellum integrates all this information so that you can not only walk or run across uneven terrain without devoting any conscious thought to how to do so; you can turn your head, maybe even drink from a bottle of water, and look at another person while you are walking without (much) chance of falling down. Your Cat’s Cerebellum and the Feline Distemper Virus The cerebellum is obviously a complex piece of equipment. During fetal development, the cerebellum matures up until the last few days before birth and finishes its development in the first couple of weeks after birth.  Having a long period of development leaves the cerebellum especially vulnerable to an assortment of toxins for a long period of time. In the case of cerebellar hypoplasia, the culprit is thefeline distemper virus(also called the panleukopenia virus). Following infection in the pregnant mother, growing nerves in the unborn kitten’s cerebellum are destroyed, ultimately yielding a tiny, improperly developed cerebellum and a disability for the kitten. The mother cat may not be actually infected during pregnancy to create this syndrome; if, while pregnant, she has been vaccinated with a modified live distemper vaccine, the most basic of all cat vaccines, it can have the same detrimental effects. . Kittens infected with distemper under the age of two weeks may also experience enough cerebellar damage to suffer cerebellar hypoplasia. This means that mother cats due for vaccines should not be vaccinated during pregnancy or in the first two weeks following kitten delivery. Diagnosis While imaging such as CT scanning or MRI can be used to confirm the underdeveloped tiny cerebellum, the diagnosis of this condition is usually obvious because of the following features: Treatment No treatment can resolve the damage in a kitten with cerebellar hypoplasia. Some kittens are more severely affected than others. Owning a cat with cerebellar hypoplasia emphasizes managing the condition. The cat should be indoors only, and non-spill food dishes should be obtained. Most cats have a good quality of life and make up in personality what they lack in motor skills. Prevention This syndrome is easily prevented by vaccinating female cats for feline distemper when they are neither pregnant nor nursing kittens under the age of two weeks. This means that regular vaccination will prevent cerebellar hypoplasia in kittens. If a cat is pregnant, vaccination should be withheld during pregnancy and for a good three to four weeks after the kittens are born. If you think you have a CH cat, be sure your veterinarian concurs as there are other cerebellar diseases that are not as benign as this one. If you do have a CH cat, keep your home "cat-proofed" for his/her safety given issues with coordination and consider joining an on-line community for tips and camaraderie.

Category: Hyperesthesia Syndrome in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Also called rolling skin disease The word hyperesthesia basically means an increase in sensitivity. If you have a cat with this syndrome, you will probably be well aware of what is meant by this. These cats act as though they have pain from simply being petted, especially along their lower back. Their skin seems to twitch as if they are irritated just by the air currents passing over them. Some cats will attack their tails or even go running through the house screaming. Cats with milder disease may simply lick or bite their paws in response to petting. Often, itchy skin conditions, such as flea bite allergy, make the syndrome more prominent. Some cats actually go into seizures when touched in a certain way. According to one theory,hyperesthesia syndromeis a type of compulsive disorder, usually initiated when the cat is in conflict. The cat wants to perform one behavior but it is prevented from doing so and ultimately performs another behavior in frustration. After a while, this second behavior, frequently grooming or biting behavior, is performed compulsively and is brought on by relatively minor stimulation. Another prominent theory is that hyperesthesia results from inappropriate pain perception (called "maladaptive pain"). According to this theory, the cat at one time experienced an acutely painful situation which sensitized nerves to create a chronic pain situation. The original wound or event is long healed but the sensitized nerves continue to transmit pain in response to contact that should not be painful. Inappropriate twitching, scratching, biting and even screaming result. The usual patient is relatively young, one to two years old, and most commonly an Oriental breed such as a Burmese, Siamese, Abyssinian, or Persian, though any breed of cat can be involved. Treatment The goal of treatment is ultimately to provide the cat with good life quality, free from discomfort. The cat should not have seizures, self-mutilate, become incontinent, or act aggressively during an episode. Medication may not be needed if the cat merely undergoes compulsive grooming in response to certain types of petting or if episodes can be avoided by refraining from touching certain body areas of the cat. If the cat is triggering episodes on its own through normal grooming, intervention is probably necessary. A good first step is to manage itching. Itch stimulation leads to grooming, which can lead to a full-blown episode of compulsive self-mutilation or even seizing, so it is important to make sure obvious sources of itch are controlled. This means that there should be no fleas in the cat's environment, and medication (such as corticosteroids) should be used to relieve any skin inflammation. Omega 3 fatty acid supplements can be added to the diet to decrease the skin's sensitivity to itch. Simplycontrolling itchmay be all that is needed to prevent compulsive episodes. If the cat is still having excessive episodes despite a reduction in itch stimulation, a more neurologic approach may be needed.  If seizures are part of the problem and controlling the itch does not control them, then medication for seizures should be used (phenobarbitalis the most common feline choice, but other medications are available as well).Gabapentinmay be added in as it not only has anti-seizure effects, but it also is useful for neuropathic pain, which is pain deriving from over-sensitive nerves. If compulsive grooming seems to be more of a problem than seizures, then psychoactive medications such asfluoxetineandclomipraminemay be in order, along with the use of toys or other stimulating objects to distract the cat from an episode.  Because the episodes seem to have their roots in behavior conflict, the cat’s environment needs to be stabilized with scheduled feedings, plenty of toys and minimized competition for refuge and the litter box with other cats. Inner conflict can be avoided if the cat feels free to engage in normal activities without being bullied by other pets or limited by available resources. Since the tail is often the target of self-mutilation, it is important to rule out sources of pain, such as old injuries (especially old tail fractures or broken hip bones) that might cause sudden nerve or muscle spasms. For these situations, pain management techniques, such as physical therapy, chiropractic adjustment, acupuncture, medication, or a combination thereof, may be helpful. It is also important not to forget anal sac pain, as this involves the tail area and can be easily controlled, if not solved. There is tremendous variability in response to treatment. Some cats respond to itch relief alone, while others require seizure control plus itch relief, and still more require more extensive psychoactive medications. The cat may not end up being completely normal, but it is a reasonable goal to expect that, ultimately, there will be no self-mutilation. Inappropriate pain perception should be reduced to the extent that the cat has a good life quality overall.

Category: Hyperesthesia Syndrome in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  Feline hyperesthesia syndrome (FHS) is known by several names including “rolling skin disease”, “neurodermatitis”, neuritis, psychomotor epilepsy, and pruritic dermatitis. Hyperesthesia means “too much feeling.” It can be difficult to determine whether the cause is behavioral or medical without additional diagnostics, such as an MRI or EEG. Clinical signs of feline hyperesthesia syndrome (FSH) can range from mild to self-mutilating. Common behaviors seen include: To diagnose FHS, other conditions related to the skin and nervous system must be ruled out first. These include: To rule out underlying medical causes, expect your veterinarian to do a full physical, orthopedic, and neurological exam to determine the cause. Diagnostics may include radiographs, blood work or urinalysis, skin swabs or skin scrapes. Treatment for FHS depends on the cause. Your veterinarian may recommend medications, supplements, weight loss or rehabilitation. Treatment of skin conditions may require antibiotics, medications for itch and inflammation or diet change. If a physical cause cannot be found, antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed. In addition to medications, there are some treatments that apply to all cats with clinical signs of FHS such as: The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Manx Syndrome in Cats Manx syndrome (sacrocaudal dysgenesis, sacrocaudal agenesis) is an array of problems involving the function of the hind legs, urinary bladder, and colon of a tailless cat. In affected cats, the spine and spinal cord are shortened because the last few vertebrae and spinal segments have not developed normally. Manx syndrome is most common in Manx cats. The British breed from the Isle of Man is typically tailless. Manx syndrome has been occasionally described in mixed-breed tailless cats. Sacrocaudaul dysgenesis is rare in dogs, however, clinical signs are similar. Inheritance Manx syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait in the Manx cat, meaning the Manx syndrome trait can be passed down from just one parent's genes and the offspring will have the trait. However, the degree of spinal malformation can vary. All Manx cats, with or without a tail, have the mutant gene and can produce tailless offspring. Neurological problems are most common in tailless cats. Signs Some tailless cats have mild or no neurologic changes, while others have severe neurologic deficits. Signs depend on how severely the cat’s spinal cord is affected. Significantly affected cats may die in utero or be euthanized soon after birth. Signs are usually recognized when the kitten starts to walk, anywhere from weeks to months after birth. Clinical signs may include an abnormal pelvic limb gait (back legs), urinary and fecal incontinence, lack of sensation in the hind legs and around the openings of the anus and urethra, and some level of hind-end paralysis. Those cats whose hind legs do not function the way they should are usually unable to participate in some typical cat behaviors, such as jumping, and need to be kept as indoor cats. Signs can include: Diagnostics and Treatment Your veterinarian will take a thorough medical history and perform a complete physical examination to make the diagnosis. Some radiographs or other imaging tests may be recommended, as well as a urinalysis, a neurologic examination, and a bacterial culture to test for aurinary tract infection. There is no curative treatment. All that can be offered is supportive care and keeping the cat clean while managing any incontinence, hygiene, megacolon, urinary tract infections, and constipation. Daily grooming is necessary for cats incapable of controlling their bowels or bladder as chronic skin contact with urine or feces can start an ongoing struggle with lifelong skin irritation and urinary infections that must be treated. If your cat is incontinent, your veterinarian can show you how to manually empty the bladder to help prevent urine scald and bladder infection. Diapers can be used to prevent soiling if your cat will tolerate them. Stool softeners can help ease constipation. Prevention Parents of affected cats should not be bred again to prevent suffering.

Category: Seizure Disorders in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Watching your cat have a seizure is difficult. It is often a confusing and scary time for both you and your cat. This difficulty is especially true if you don’t know your cat is having a seizure and even if you do, it doesn’t necessarily make the experience less jarring. During the episode all sorts of questions can race through your mind, causing fear and panic. What is wrong with my cat? What do I do? Will they be okay? What are Seizures? Seizures are sudden fits of uncontrollable movement and can include twitching, shaking, and/or muscle spasms. Your cat can lose consciousness during a seizure, drool, vomit, urinate or defecate. Other signs of seizures in cats include uncontrolled running around the house, up the curtains, over the furniture, etc. Seizures are caused by abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the brain and most last a few seconds to a few minutes but some last hours. Different Types of Seizures There are two types of seizures your cat can have: focal and generalized. Focal or partial seizures only affect part of the brain. Only one side of your cat’s body will have abnormal movement. For example, your cat may move their left leg(s) strangely or their left eye, or lips or ear may twitch. Other signs of focal seizures include tail chasing, limb chewing, aggression, and strange behavior as if your cat were chewing imaginary gum. Focal seizures are more common in cats but can progress to the generalized form. Generalized seizures affect the entire brain and thus both sides of the body. They result in loss of consciousness; sudden jerking of the neck, head or body; urination; defecation; falling to one side; vocalization; vomiting; and salivation. Your cat’s legs can be stiff and difficult to bend or your cat may constantly move their legs as if they were paddling or swimming on their side. Recognizing Seizures in your Cat Your cat may act unusual hours to days before a seizure. This includes increased nervousness, attention seeking or avoidance, and head turning. Be on the lookout for these behaviors as they serve as warning signs of a seizure to come in the near future. During the seizure, which usually lasts seconds to minutes, your cat may “stare off into space” and appear mentally not there. Afterwards, it will take some time for them to go back to normal. This post-seizure period can last 24-48 hours. During this time, your cat may show signs of hyperactivity, pacing, circling, head pressing, and other changes in behavior. Seizures tend to occur when there are changes in brain activity such as when a cat is sleeping, waking, excited, or around feeding time. Paying close attention to your cat during these times will better help you identify a seizure. Recurring Seizures and Epilepsy A seizure can be a one-time event or repeated over time. Repeated seizures are called epilepsy. If your cat has epilepsy, their seizures may occur at regular intervals such as every five days or every other month. On the other hand, there may be no pattern to how often your cat’s seizures occur. Between seizures and after the post-seizure period, your cat will behave normally with no obvious signs of illness unless they have another disease going on. What Causes Seizures? One-time seizures can be caused by toxins, trauma, metabolic disease, low blood sugar, or triggering stimuli such as lights or high-pitched sounds. Metabolic issues are often linked to other diseases of the liver, kidney, or thyroid. These single seizures can progress to multiple seizures over time if the underlying cause is not treated. Multiple seizures or epilepsy is either primary or acquired. Primary epilepsy has a known or suspected genetic basis. Acquired epilepsy does not; it is caused by factors that affect the brain. These factors can directly affect the brain and include trauma, infectious disease, cancer and abnormal brain development. Other factors affect the brain indirectly and include metabolic issues, low blood sugar, toxins and triggering stimuli. Sometimes your veterinarian will not be able to determine what is causing your cat’s seizures and will call them idiopathic. Idiopathic means there is not a known cause. These types of seizures, however, are not common in cats. What Do you Do if your Cat is Having a Seizure? Most seizures cats have are not medical emergencies. The most important things you can do are make sure your cat does not hurt themselves and take note of how they act. You will need to schedule an appointment with your veterinarian so it’s important to describe what happened before, during, and after the seizure as best as possible. A video is an excellent way to do so and help your veterinarian determine what happened. During the seizure, do not touch your cat unless they are at risk of hurting themselves. If this is the case, use a thick blanket to move them as some cats become aggressive when having a seizure. Some seizures are medical emergencies. If your cat has a seizure that lasts longer than five minutes or has more than three seizures in a row without returning to normal between them, seek immediate veterinary care. This is called status epilepticus and is a medical emergency. If your cat has more than one seizure within a 24-hour period and acts normal between each one, this is called a cluster seizure. Cluster seizures are not usually considered to be an emergency, but if you are in doubt, see a veterinarian. Diagnosing Seizures A thorough history and description/record of the event are critical to diagnosis. These are important for confirming whether your cat had a seizure and if there was possible exposure to toxins. Your veterinarian will perform a physical examination of your cat and run several blood tests to rule out metabolic and infectious causes. A neurologic exam will also be performed. If diseases outside of the brain are ruled out, further diagnostics to evaluate brain function include advanced imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary neurologist. TreatmentTreatment of seizures depends on what caused them, how severe they are and how often they occur. If your cat is having a medical emergency, your veterinarian and veterinary team will stabilize them through use of fluid therapy, short-acting anti-convulsant drugs, and other measures to get the seizures under control. Once your cat is stable and if possible, their underlying issue will be treated. This can be as simple as removing a toxic substance to treating serious liver or kidney issues. Some cats with seizures respond well to this approach and will not have seizures again once the underlying cause is treated. Other cats with seizures, particularly those with epilepsy, require long term anti-convulsant therapy. Preventing your cat from ever having another seizure in their life is often not possible; the goal of treatment is to reduce how severe their seizures are and how often they happen. Improving your cat’s seizures is done by using anti-convulsant medications, particularly phenobarbital. It takes time to determine the best dose and drug for your individual cat and several adjustments are made over time to control the seizures. It is important to work closely with your veterinarian and follow the recommended treatment schedule. Seizure therapy is often a lifelong necessity. In general, cats have less side effects than dogs when it comes to seizure medication. Mild common side effects occur at the start of treatment or when changes are made to their treatment. These include drowsiness, incoordination, increased appetite and weight gain. Most of these effects are temporary so notify your veterinarian if they persist or seem severe. Prognosis and Recurrence Preventing your cat from having another seizure in their lifetime is difficult and often not possible. Even with excellent care and cooperation between you and your veterinarian, there may come a time when your cat’s current treatment plan no longer works. If this happens, your veterinarian will need to adjust the type of drug used or the dose given. You will need to have the drug levels monitored every year to see if they are in an acceptable range. Treating seizures takes a lot of effort but controlling them is important for your cat’s health; seizures can lead to permanent and irreversible brain damage so it is best if you seek treatment before this occurs.

Category: Nasal Pharyngeal Polyps in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Naso-pharyngeal polyps (nasopharyngeal polyps, otopharyngeal polyps, inflammatory polyps, middle ear polyps) are the most common masses that are seen in the external ear canal in cats. They are benign growths that can be seen in the back of the cat’s throat, the middle ear, and above the soft palate. Typically, these polyps are seen in younger cats, although cats of any age can get them. There is no known breed or sex predilection. No one is quite certain what causes nasopharyngeal polyps. They may be caused by inflammation or a virus. Some cats with these polyps also have feline calicivirus, and some cats have ear infections. Both of these problems can cause inflammation. Signs How an individual cat is affected depends on the location and size of the growth. Signs may include: If the polyp is large, the cat may have trouble swallowing, causing the owner to think the cat is not hungry. There have been two published reports of megaesophagus (dilated esophagus) secondary to chronic nasopharyngeal obstruction from a polyp, one published report of hiatal hernia secondary to the chronic nasopharyngeal obstruction, and one published report of intracranial abscess from the chronic otitis media/interna related to the polyp, but those secondary problems appear to be extremely rare. Diagnosis Diagnostic tests include a physical examination, imaging (radiographs/CT/MRI) of the skull, and biopsy of the growth. If the ear is painful, cats may require sedation or anesthesia for the ear canal examination. If the cat is going to be sedated or anesthetized, that’s a perfect time to take radiographs of the skull. A biopsy may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Treatment Polyps have to be removed surgically. Some polyps located at the back of the throat can be plucked out. This is a traction/avulsion technique. However, plucked growths often regrow. In some cases, a ventral bulla osteotomy may be used on ear polyps instead of the traction/avulsion technique. An e-collar may be necessary for 10 to 14 days after surgery to prevent the cat from disturbing the site. After surgery, the cat may be on antibiotics for a few weeks. Depending on the location of the polyp, the surgery (and the polyp) may cause some side effects on the nerves around the eye. The cat may have difficulty blinking. Generally, the nerve damage will not last more than a few days or weeks, although permanent damage is possible. Because the exact cause of each polyp is unknown, polyps sometimes recur after surgery. Some studies have shown that there is a recurrence rate of 15-50% after traction removal. Your veterinarian may advise the use of prednisone for two weeks after traction removal because it may reduce the incidence of recurrence. As with all diseases, the earlier a nasopharyngeal polyp is diagnosed and treated, the better the prognosis.

Category: Diabetic Cat Diet
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources As most of us know, proper dietary support for diabetes mellitus is very important in overall diabetes management. In cats, diabetes mellitus can actually be reversed; if there has not been too much permanent pancreatic damage, and if blood sugar can be regulated quickly, the cat can become normal. For most diabetic cats, a low carbohydrate/high protein approach is the best route to accomplishing this goal, though the priority is given to maintaining proper body condition and managing diet needs for concurrent medical conditions. Cats become diabetic when they experience sustained high blood sugar levels for too long. Genetics and diet aside, any cat can be made into a diabetic cat by subjecting the cat to repeated intravenous glucose infusions for a long enough time. Too much glucose in the bloodstream over time depletes the pancreas of insulin as the pancreas struggles to control all that sugar day after day. This struggle eventually creates an insulin deficiency, which is basically what diabetes mellitus is. In a more natural setting where repeated intravenous glucose infusions do not occur, the problem is a high carbohydrate diet. When we eat carbohydrates and they enter our bodies, there is a rise in blood sugar levels that persists for several hours. In the cat, it is more like eight to twelve hours, even longer if the cat is obese. This circulating blood sugar stimulates insulin secretion so that all sugar can be stored in the body. If the cat is snacking on dry food throughout the day, he or she may be secreting insulin throughout the day as well. This makes for a fat cat and a depleted pancreas. Over-eating high carbohydrate diets promotes the development of diabetes mellitus and creates obesity. Obesity itself further promotes the development of diabetes mellitus. We have mentioned that a diabetic cat can become normal if blood sugar levels are returned to normal and kept normal for a long enough time. This cannot usually be done without insulin injections, but diet is important as well. We need to minimize the post-meal glucose tide that contributed to the cat's diabetes. One way to do this is to provide few dietary carbohydrates. The body still needs sugars to run its metabolism, but the patient's liver is happy to make them from dietary proteins, and the liver does so without creating any post-meal glucose spikes. This makes for a more even blood sugar level throughout the day and reduces the amount of insulin needed to keep things under control. Sounds great, right? So How Much Carbohydrate Should We be Looking for? The bad news is that the information we are looking for is probably not going to be on the pet food label. We are going to have to look it up on the company website. We are looking for less than 7% of the diet's metabolizable energy as carbohydrates. What does this mean? Let's start with "metabolizable energy." A calorie is a measurement of the energy content in an amount of food. We need this energy to run our bodies. Picture a plate of food. That food is said to have a certain number of calories. If you take the food and incinerate it, the amount of heat it generates is measured in calories. This measurement is the gross energy of the food. This is what is meant when a cookie is said to have 100 calories or a frozen dinner has 300 calories, etc. But these calories are not 100% available for your personal use when you eat that plate of food. Some of that food will end up as fecal matter, and some calories are used in the process of digesting the food. This means that the 100-calorie cookie you eat might only provide your body with 90 calories for your personal use. The gross energy minus the energy that wasn't digested = digestible energy. It turns out there is another level before we are able to use our meal calories. We have to process the fuel/food/calories after they have been absorbed into our bodies. We have to transport them into our cells so they can be used. After all the energy used in processing new fuel/calories is taken into consideration, we are left with metabolizable energy, a common reference in nutrition when evaluating diet. The metabolizable energy is now available to be burned/used, so theoretically, our 100-calorie cookie on the plate has provided us with 80 calories to actually use. It is the metabolizable energy that concerns us because this is the only way to compare the protein, fat, and carbohydrate content of different diets; we have to factor out all the undigestible or unusable material to be able to compare. Values are expressed as "% ME," in other words, the percentage of the total metabolizable energy. OnceAgain,the“MagicNumber”foraDiabeticCat’sDietIsLessThan7%CarbohydrateME.Finding this information is a little tricky as it will not be on the pet food label. If you are lucky, you can go to the manufacturer’s website and find the %ME for fat, carbohydrate, and protein. If it isn't available and you still want to know, there will be math involved. Kibble requires a certain carbohydrate content to be molded and shaped, but canned diets do not have such limitations, which means that this degree of carbohydrate restriction is only possible in a canned diet. There are several therapeutic diets manufactured with carbohydrate restriction fitting the above guideline.  Ask your veterinarian for guidance in selection. If possible, 3-4 small meals should be provided daily, but if this is impractical, then twice daily feedings in conjunction with giving insulin can be provided.There are many cats who simply do not like canned food, and such diabetic cats can most certainly be regulated with carbohydrate-restricted dry foods if necessary, but if possible, they should transition to canned food. Obese Diabetic Cats Obesity makes for difficult diabetic regulation. Weight loss is key and the high protein/low carbohydrate strategy discussed above may have too many calories for an overweight cat. This is where it may be more important to use a different strategy in reducing post-feeding glucose tides. Instead of using low-carbohydrate diets and forcing the patient to make their own carbohydrates, it may be better to use fiber (complex carbohydrates) to create a better sense of fullness after a lower-calorie meal. Weight loss improves the ability to achieve diabetic regulation 13-fold but must be done smartly as a greater than 2% weight loss per week is dangerous to a cat and promotes the development of a liver disease calledhepatic lipidosis. A good goal is 0.5-1% weekly. Your veterinarian can design a weight loss plan. Several therapeutic diets are designed for this use. Your veterinarian is your best source of information for what to feed your diabetic cat. Obviously, there are individual concerns, a concurrent illness that may require diabetic modifications, and logistics issues to consider. You can also see a professional veterinary nutritionist to devise a homemade diet. The biggest point is that diet strategy is an important part of diabetic regulation.

Category: Weight Loss for Obese Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Obesity is a common disease in cats, affecting 43-65% of the patients seen in veterinary clinics across the United States. Just like in humans, excess fat is accumulated in cats due to an imbalance between the number ofcalories being consumedand the amount of energy being expended during daily activity. Unfortunately, obesity is much more than just a little extra cat to love! Obesity can lead to many secondary problems includingdiabetes,arthritis,kidneyand pancreatic disease, cardiovascular issues, and infections, all of which can ultimately lead to a reduced lifespan for our four-legged friends. Weight loss alone has been shown to reduce risk and even reverse some of these conditions in cats, particularly with diabetes. Prevention Fortunately, obesity is a preventable and treatable disease. Avoiding obesity in our pets can be accomplished by choosing quality food, providing an appropriate amount of food and treats, promoting exercise, monitoring weight changes, and adjusting the amount of food that they receive based on those changes. As with other diseases, prevention is the best approach to ensuring the health of our pets, but sometimes we do not realize just how much weight our cats are gaining between visits to the vet. Body Condition Score (BCS) The ideal weight for your cat is determined by their body condition score (BCS), which is measured on a9-point scalethat your veterinarian will assign based on your cat's silhouette as well as the size and location of their fat stores. Using this BCS, veterinarians can establish an ideal weight for each individual cat, which gives us a reference point for weight loss goals and progress. Cats are considered overweight if they weigh 10-20% more than this ideal weight and obese if that number rises to over 20%. Achieving Weight Loss Your Cat's Ideal Weight The first step in weight loss is to determine your cat's ideal body weight based on their BCS. A score of 4-5 is considered an appropriate body condition, so anything greater than 5 is overweight, and anything under 4 is underweight. The general rule is that every 1-point increase or decrease from the ideal BCS score (4-5) is about 10-15% of their weight. For example, if your cat is given a BCS of 6, they need to lose 10-15% of their body weight in order to return to their ideal weight, whereas a cat with a BCS of 9 would have to lose 40-60% of their body weight. With this ideal weight in mind, you and your veterinarian can set a weight loss goal for your cat of losing 0.5-1.5% of their body weight per week. It is important that they do not lose weight too quickly, as we do not want your cat missing out on any essential nutrients that could lead to other problems, likehepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease). Improving Your Cat's Diet Next, you'll need to assess the current food intake of your furry friend; this includes the type of food they eat, the amount they receive, how often they are fed (2-3 times per day, free feeding, etc.), and the number of treats or extra food they are given. If your cat is being given a lot of treats or has unlimited access to food throughout the day, one of the first things you want to do is start feeding them isolated meals, spreading their total daily food ration over 2-3 meals per day. Eliminating treats and extra food from the table is another quick and easy way to decrease calories. Many veterinarians will recommend switching to a veterinary therapeutic weight loss diet that is specifically formulated to decrease calories while still maintaining all of the nutrients that your cat needs. You may also want to considertrying canned foodinstead of dry food if your cat will eat it, as canned food typically has a lower calorie content due to the increased water content of the food. Purr-fect Portions Finally, it’s time to put your plan into action. There is an equation that can be used to calculate the number of calories that your cat should be consuming each day, however, many veterinarians do not rely on this alone as it is based on an average and can vary dramatically between individual cats. Somewhat severe dietary restriction is often necessary to achieve these weight loss goals, so you will typically start by decreasing your cat's food intake by around 20% and monitor their progress by weighing them every 2-3 weeks. Monitoring their weight is one of the most important parts of this process, as you may need to further decrease the amount of food they are receiving if they are not hitting that goal of losing 0.5-1.5% of their body weight per week. It is best to use a small gram scale to weigh your cat's food before each meal so you know exactly how much they are getting, as measuring cups and scoops can be inaccurate for measuring kibble. Monitoring Activity and Weight To help increase your cat's weight loss and keep that weight from being put back on, you can also try various types of enrichment (toys, wands with toys at the end, food mazes, or outdoor catios) to help your cat become more active and burn more calories each day. Once your cat has returned to their ideal weight, it is important to continue these new lifestyle changes and work to find a feeding plan that allows them to maintain that healthy weight. Measuring your cat’s weight can be done by weighing yourself, holding your cat, weighing again, and then subtracting the difference. This may not be as accurate as your veterinarian’s scale but will do in a pinch, and beats having to get your cat to the vet every week. You can also weigh your cat in the cat carrier, then weigh the carrier alone and subtract the difference. Obesity is a common problem many of our pets face, but fortunately, it is something we can reverse with simple lifestyle changes. With an appropriate amount of quality food, a consistent feeding schedule, and a little more exercise, there is no reason a healthy cat should not be able to return to that ideal weight. Avoiding obesity can help reduce your cat's risk of many life-threatening conditions, improving not only the length of their life but also the quality. Although it may be challenging for both you and your cat to adjust to some of these changes, it will certainly be worth it.

Category: Solensia™ (Frunevetmab Injection):  An Arthritis Medication Just for Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Relieving pain in cats is difficult because oftentimes, they do not tolerate common pain medications, including many NSAIDs; in fact, one ibuprofen (Advil®) or acetaminophen (Tylenol®) can make a cat seriously ill. Remembering this fact is a good reminder that cats are a unique species, and what works for them is often not the same as what works for dogs or people. This reality has led to a drug designed specifically to treat cats for discomfort from arthritis. It has been used in other countries for a while and is now available in the U.S. Osteoarthritisis what people commonly refer to as arthritis or degenerative joint disease, and this new drug is specifically targeted for osteoarthritis. When cartilage, the protective tissue in joints, is damaged and wears down over time, the loss of cartilage allows the bones to rub against each other. The unprotected bone begins to change, and the joint becomes inflamed. This process is arthritis. It is progressive and irreversible. Without treatment, chronic pain will continue to get worse over time, thereby limiting your cat's ability to jump up or down, walk or run at a normal speed, get where they want to go, and affect their basic quality of life. Solensia™ is the brand name of a prescription drug called frunevetmab. It cannot be purchased over the counter and must be given by a veterinarian. It's a subcutaneous injection to be given monthly. There may be evidence indicating two injections are needed for improvement to appear. Depending on your cat's weight, one or two vials may be needed; overweight cats are likely to need a second vial. How it Works Solensia™ is an injectable antibody drug. Antibodies are proteins made by animal (and human) immune systems and carry out many different functions. Solensia™ is a type of antibody called a monoclonal antibody (mono-meaning one) that controls pain by targeting and blocking the activity of one specific protein called nerve growth factor (NGF). As NGF plays a role in inflammation and pain, and it is elevated in joints with arthritis, Solensia™ helps to control pain by controlling NGF. Most cats show improvement in mobility within the first three weeks. Because it is an antibody and not a chemical, Solensia™ is safer than other drugs used to control pain, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Solensia™ can be used in patients with other conditions, such as liver or kidney diseases. It also can be used with most other drugs and probably can be used for long periods of time. As this drug is relatively new, more research is needed to understand potential long-term side effects in cats.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Editor's note: Not all veterinarians agree that spaying cats at this age decreases the cat population. Talk to your veterinarian about your pet.) There is a thoughtful new movement designed to get to the next and final phase of ending domestic annual over production of kittens. The over-production problem is becoming known in animal shelters as thekitten tsunami, which occurs each late spring/early summer. The solution is preventing successful winter mating season through timely sterilization.  I will not recount the number of advantages of feline sterilization (spay/neuter.)  Most reading this already know them.  But what is not generally known is the female feline reproductive cycle.  That cycle, when understood, is the driving force behind the spay by 4 or 5 months of age championed by several profile groups. Caring pet providers, who do not want to allow the nearly inevitable unplanned and unwanted pregnancy to occur, must request the fail-safe spay before the predictable breeding season arrives.  That means all moms of this past year and all new potential queens by 5 months of age should have their once-in-a-lifetime sterilization surgery. December 21:Winter begins (the shortest day of the year)Each day becomes a little longer. The longer day triggers the process called estrous (heat). Some queens will exhibit signs of estrous from as early as late January. Certainly by mid-February queens 5 months or older may be ready for a tom. The clock starts. Once bred it is:2 months gestation = birth2 months nursing = weaning+3 months = kittens maturing5 months of age (August/Sept.) March 20:Spring beginsBirthing begins with a few litters then crescendos with activity.  Cats are in heat, pregnant, (with short rest between heats) or nursing.  Peak time here is May, June and July: shelter kitten tsunami, considering the weaning time is around 8 weeks (2 months) of age. June 21:Summer begins (The longest day of the year)At this time of year the days are getting shorter.  Estrous is easing with a lot of overlap here.  A number of surprised caregivers are now scheduling spays though the damage is already done.  The “oops” (unplanned) litters are often now a problem.  What is to become of all those kittens.  Moms should be spayed 2 to 3 weeks after weaning or when the breasts have receded. September 23:Fall beginsThe days are now short enough that estrous (heat) is pretty much on seasonal hold.  Peace generally prevails and by mid-October estrous is down to zero. This year’s kittens are on the edge and not likely to be signaled into estrous. Even female kittens in February will probably not go into estrous this year, but all females this year will do so this upcoming breeding season. Spay by 5 months before winter solstice. Note: The best holiday gift for your cat is a trip to the veterinarian for neutering (whether male or female.) Let's put this basic nature's plan for cats into an organized and useful outline.  Let's start with all queens in the non-sexually active state = December.   December 21stis the start of the winter season, marking the shortest day of the year with each succeeding day becoming longer.  The incremental increasing lengths of daylight that begin after December 21stare being received through the eye and sent by the queen's optic nerve to signal this fact to the pituitary gland which, in turn, makes a hormone signaling the ovary that it's time to make follicles.  Pretty amazing.  The follicles, of course, make the eggs and estrogen.  It is the estrogen that makes the queen into what we see: a vocal tom-seeking maniac. The mating season is on! The toms, of course, are always ready and willing to serve.  This magical time will begin toward the end of January and becomes full blown by mid-February.  The domestic queen is an induced ovulator, meaning, when copulation takes place the severe stimulation of the mating process causes the follicles to rupture.  The eggs and estrogen are then released.  Now, two things are certain: she goes out of heat and there is guaranteed timing in which the sperm finds eggs.  Thus begins 61 - 63 days of gestation. So now let's look at the next season (spring, March 20thbegins the gestation/delivery/ nursing season).  By this time all unspayed queens are in various stages of the active breeding cycle.  Early estrous queens who mated in January will be delivering their litters starting in mid-March.  This is followed by a crescendo of successful matings resulting in more and more females who will be delivering.  There are those queens who were kept under house arrest and avoided the male encounter.  However, felines not mated often restart estrous within a few weeks for round two. Whenever a queen mates, it is 61-63 days later that an average of 3 to 5 kittens are born.  Then 2 months (8-9 weeks) later, the kittens are weaning and the caretaker may decide to keep them or try to re-home them.  If unsuccessful, ultimately the heart wrenching decision is made to take them to the shelter.  Shelters call May, June, and July the kitten tsunami season as there are multiple litters arriving per day.  Of course, while kittens are nursing and growing they are a delight to watch.  Their placement two months after delivery now becomes an acute dilemma for shelters. Days begin shortening on June 21st, which is also the first day of summer, and there are kittens and cats of all stages and ages.  Some queens will get pregnant a second time.  With house arrest or just luck the first estrous will subside but if mating did not occur, the female's heat will restart and toms have had a second chance.  If she appears out of heat it could well be she is actually pregnant in which case, of course, the queen will soon look pregnant (distended abdomen). The traditional calendar reports September 23rdas the beginning of fall season.  Pretty much by the end of August, cycling (periods of heat) has stopped.  Closure proceeds normally for the development of the last of this past year's nursing and weaning.  Thus, fall is a blessed period of general feline tranquility until the next winter breeding season begins.  Kittens are growing and moms gain weight back. So there's the basic outline of what and when the forces of nature make the queens (young and older) do what they do.  Personal experiences may differ somewhat but this outline encompasses the vast majority of them.  Some obvious factors may change some of the timing; e.g.; caretakers in the southerly states are going to recognize this pattern; northern states may find the seasons are shorter; whereas in Hawaii the season is almost year round kitten time.  Indoor cats with artificial lighting can have their heat cycles affected by their caretakers' personal use of lighting. Armed with those time frames and the combination of age at a given season we know that young queens can come into estrous as early as 4 to 5 months and for sure by 6 months.  This means spaying by 5 months is good insurance against "oops" litters.   A little thing like "I forgot to make an appointment" or simple procrastination can happen far too easily in our busy lives. What is absolute is that any of the female kittens born into any year's reproductive cycle will be more than ready to respond to nature's wake-up call by the winter's increasing daylight.  There is plenty of evidence that unintended litters are born simply because the queens were not spayed.  Don't let your charge be one who adds to the kitten tsunami. The sheer number of veterinarians who sterilize cats younger than 6 months and the reported ease of surgery, safety and rapid recovery makes spaying at 4 or 5 months of age a sound practice.  By performing surgery by 5 months and eliminating all of the "oops" litters, the overbirthing could theoretically be eliminated in one or two years.  What a triumph that would be for all concerned.

Category: Electronic Cigarettes are Toxic to Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Electronic cigarettes, often called e-cigs, are marketed as an alternative to cigarette smoking.  They are also referred to as personal vaporizers or electronic nicotine delivery systems. These devices have a cylindrical body that holds a cartridge containing a liquid solution; some resemble tobacco cigarettes.  The solution, termed “e-liquid” or “e-juice,” contains a base material, flavoring compounds, and nicotine. The base material is generally propylene glycol and either vegetable glycerin or polyethylene glycol. Glycerin and propylene glycol are of low toxicity when eaten, but the amount in the refill bottles (usually 10-30% of what's in the bottle) is low enough to not be much of a concern; nicotine is the bigger issue. Whether any of the compounds used are toxic if inhaled long term is not known. The nicotine levels in these e-liquids can vary in concentration from being completely nicotine-free up to 36 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) of nicotine. For marketing purposes, the “/mL” part is frequently dropped, and the e-liquids are advertised as having X mg of nicotine rather than X mg/mL. In some e-cigs, the user controls the amount of nicotine delivered by adjusting the flow of e-liquid from the cartridge. An e-cig with a full cartridge can contain up to 36 mg of nicotine, which doesn’t sound like a lot until you factor in how toxic nicotine is.  Clinical signs of nicotine poisoning can be seen in dogs and cats exposed to a mere 0.5 mg per pound of body weight.  For cats and small dogs, ingesting 20 mg of nicotine can be lethal. Even more dangerous are the bottles of e-liquid that are used to recharge the e-cig cartridge: the nicotine in these bottles can range from 10 mL to 60 mL or more.  So a 30-mL bottle of 36 mg/mL e-liquid will contain 1080 mg of nicotine, more than enough to prove fatal for even a very large dog if the contents are ingested. Nicotine is readily absorbed by ingestion as well as through the skin.  Pets may be exposed when they chew up the e-cigs or the bottles containing e-juice or even when they walk through puddles of spilled e-juice and get it on their paws.  The signs of nicotine poisoning may begin within 15 to 30 minutes of exposure to the e-liquid; in contrast, signs of nicotine poisoning following eating tobacco products may take a few hours as the nicotine must be released from the tobacco. The first signs normally seen with toxic exposure to nicotine include: With severe intoxications, signs may progress to include: Further progression of signs may result in profound weakness, paralysis, abnormal heart rhythms (including cardiac arrest), hypotension, coma, and death. Prompt and aggressive veterinary care is required to successfully manage poisoning from e-juice exposure.  Because the e-juice is rapidly absorbed across the mucous membranes of the mouth, standard decontamination measures such as inducing vomiting are usually not helpful.  Treatment includes managing convulsions and seizures, treating heart and blood pressure abnormalities, ensuring adequate respiration, and providing intravenous fluids to enhance nicotine elimination.The prognosis for patients exposed to large amounts of nicotine can be quite grave depending on how quickly veterinary care is obtained, and even with aggressive veterinary care, some patients will not survive.

Category: Bladder Stones (Oxalate) in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Discovering Your Cat Has a Bladder Stone Presumably, you are reading this page because your cat has or had a calcium oxalate bladder stone or your cat has or had a bladder stone that is likely to be a calcium oxalate bladder stone. The stone was most likely discovered in one of these scenarios: If your cat has bladder stones, the stones need to be eliminated and their recurrence prevented. Central to this mission is determining the type of stone, and while we may be able to get some information from the urinalysis, we really need to retrieve a stone for analysis to get the story. If we are lucky, the cat will pass a small stone that can be sent to the lab, but most likely we are going to need surgery or one of the other stone retrieval methods reviewed below. Unlike struvite stones, calcium oxalate stones will not dissolve with dietary manipulation, although an attempt can certainly be made at dietary dissolution. If this is unsuccessful, though, we are back to square one and the need to retrieve a stone. Why Do Cats Develop Calcium Oxalate Bladder Stones? About 25 years or so ago, cats virtually never developed calcium oxalate bladder stones. Cat bladder stones could reliably be assumed to be made ofstruvite(a matrix of ammonium-magnesium-phosphate). In those days, feline lower urinary tract symptoms were generally thought to be caused by struvite crystals in the urine, and feline lower urinary tract symptoms were extremely common. The pet food industry responded by acidifying cat foods to prevent crystals from developing. In a way, it worked. Feline lower urinary tract symptoms declined. Male cats with struvite urinary blockages became far less common. The trade-off was that calcium oxalate bladder stones began to develop. Acidifying the body leads to an acid urine pH and more calcium loss into the urine, both factors in the development of a calcium oxalate stone. Currently, most bladder stones formed by cats are calcium oxalate stones. Calcium Oxalate Points How to Get Rid of the Stones Cystotomy (Surgical Removal)The fastest way to resolve a bladder stone issue is to remove the stones surgically. To accomplish this, the cat is anesthetized, and an incision is made through the belly. The bladder is lifted into view, opened, and stones are removed. Cultures to rule out infection are obtained if not done previously. The bladder is closed in several layers. The belly is closed, and the patient is awakened. Pain medication and antibiotics are routinely used after surgery. The patient usually remains hospitalized for a day or two to observe urination. The stones are sent to the lab for analysis. It is normal for some blood to be evident in the urine for several days after surgery. Obviously, this is an invasive approach but it does provide rapid resolution, is the traditional approach, and can be performed in most veterinary hospitals. Cystoscopy and Laser LithotripsyA less invasive method involves using a cystoscope, a long skinny instrument that removes stones from the bladder using a small basket-like retrieval accessory. This can only be done with small stones and can only be done in female cats. For larger stones, laser lithotripsy can be used to break the stone into smaller pieces that can be removed or passed. Laser lithotripsy requires the cystoscope laser to be in contact with the stone so, again, the cat must be female; the male cat's urethra is too small for a cystoscope. Percutaneous Cystolithotomy (PCCL)Another less invasive way to remove bladder stones is called percutaneous cystolithotomy (PCCL). In this procedure, your cat t is under anesthesia and veterinary internal medicine specialist makes a small incision over the bladder. They insert a small tube (trochar) and a tiny camera (cystoscope) to look inside the bladder and urethra and then remove any stones. This can be done for both male and female cats. Voiding UrohydropropulsionThis technique can work if the stones are small enough to pass through the patient's urethra. The patient is sedated, the bladder is distended with fluid, agitated, and manually expressed under pressure. By positioning the sedated patient vertically, gravity "loads" the stones in the neck of the bladder, positioned for expulsion. When the bladder is expressed, oftentimes stones can be passed that might otherwise have stayed in the bladder. Larger stones cannot be passed using this technique, and it is almost impossible to get a stone to pass this way in a male cat. Using a diet to dissolve a calcium oxalate stone is not possible. Once a stone has been retrieved, it can be submitted to the laboratory for analysis. After it is confirmed as calcium oxalate, the goal is to prevent future stones. Stone Prevention Retrieving the stones is generally the easy part of managing calcium oxalate stones. Preventing future stones is more challenging. If the patient is one of the 35% with elevated blood calcium, then steps to control the calcium level and determine why it is high should be taken. (See hypercalcemia). If blood calcium levels are normal, the following step-by-step regimen is recommended: Step one: Feed a non-acidifying diet that minimizes calcium oxalates in the urineSuch diets use a normal calcium content, a moderate magnesium content, and citrate to bind urinary calcium.  Your veterinarian can recommend an appropriate therapeutic food. A canned diet is preferred over dry food due to its high water content. Part of the goal is to create dilute urine, and the extra water consumption is helpful. Meal feeding rather than free feeding may also be helpful in maintaining the desired urinary pH. Avoid supplementation with vitamin C. Vitamin C is converted to oxalic acid, which modifies into oxalate. Be careful of pet vitamin supplements. In two to four weeks, perform a urinalysis to see if there are calcium oxalate crystals (there should not be), if the urine is dilute (the specific gravity of the urine should be less than 1.030), and if the urine pH is alkaline (it should be 6.8-7.5). If the urinary pH is less than 6.5, the urine is too acidic, and potassium citrate must be given as a supplement, either as a chewable tablet, capsule, or oral liquid. Step two: Correcting problems in the first urinalysisIf the urine specific gravity is > 1.030, this means that the urine is not adequately diluted. The cat will need to drink more water. This is best accomplished by increasing the percentage of canned food in the diet, though other options might include using a fountain to encourage drinking or Purina Hydra Care® (a supplement added to drinking water). Another urinalysis is performed in two to four weeks. Step three: If oxalate crystals are present, the urine is not dilute, or if the pH of the urine is acid (pH less than 7.5), the following steps are taken:A thiazide diuretic is added to dilute the urine and correct the necessary electrolyte balance in the urine. Vitamin B6 is supplemented. A population of cats has been identified for which a B6 deficiency leads to oxalate stone development. This may or may not be helpful but is worth trying. The vitamin B6 deficiency leads to an increase in blood oxalic acid, which in turn leads to an increase in urine oxalates. A different food may need to be selected. Once a urinalysis with the appropriate values is obtained, the patient is rechecked every three to six months with a urinalysis and every six to 12 months for radiographs. In females, stones may be identified when they are still small enough to be induced to pass naturally. A male cat will require surgery to remove stones as the male tract is invariably too small for stones to pass. View the fullrecommendationsof the University of Minnesota Veterinary Stone Lab.

Category: Bladder Stones (Struvite) in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Struvite? Struvite is a urinary mineral composed of ammonium, phosphate, and magnesium. These three substances are common in urine and if they exist in high enough concentrations, they will bind together in the form of crystals. Struvite crystals are normally found in urine and have no significance on their own. Problems occur when these crystals combine with mucus and form a urinary plug that can cause a blockage in a male cat’s urinary tract (seefeline urinary blockage) or when the crystals bind together to form a bladder stone. Struvite is also sometimes called triple phosphate, based on some early studies that had misidentified the minerals. The name has stuck, though, so you may hear this term. Before widespread cat food reformulation in the 1980s, feline bladder stones could virtually be counted on to be struvite, as opposed to some other type of mineral. Nowadays, approximately 50% of feline bladder stones are struvite and the other 50% arecalcium oxalate. The therapy for each of these stones is different so it is important to know which type of stone a cat has in order to provide proper treatment and prevention. If Struvite Crystals are Normal, Why Do Some Cats Form Stones? There are several factors at play here. The pH of the urine, the presence of proteins around which the crystals can aggregate, and urinary water content all are important issues. Ultimately, these factors come together to contribute to urine that is supersaturated with struvite. In dogs, infection is necessary to create a struvite bladder stone but in 95% of cats with struvite stones, no infection was involved (though sometimes the stone can lead to infection.) Symptoms While bladder stones can sometimes be found incidentally while looking into another problem, most of the time they are found when the cat is showing signs of lower urinary tract disease: These symptoms are expressed regardless of what the lower urinary tract disease is. Other lower urinary tract diseases include:idiopathic cystitis,bladder infection,bladder tumor, and more obscure issues such as healing bladder trauma. In cats showing signs of lower urinary tract disease, approximately 25% of them will have bladder stones so it is worthwhile to take a radiograph of the bladder to check. A urinalysis will be helpful in determining the type of stone and in ruling out other causes of urinary symptoms. Treatment: Dietary Dissolution Struvite stones can be dissolved by feeding specific diets. There are several commercial brands available and they all act by creating a bladder environment that is favorable to dissolving the struvite crystals back into the urine. In order for this treatment to work, the patient must eat the dissolution diet as the sole food. Obviously, the cat should not have a second disease that makes the stone diet inappropriate and the cat must be fed only the urinary diet and nothing else. If the cat does not like one diet, another can be selected; both dry and canned selections are available and can be mixed together though there is some thinking that the extra water that goes with a canned diet is more beneficial for stone dissolution. A typical protocol involves radiographs every 3 to 4 weeks to confirm that the stone is actually dissolving, though some cats are able to dissolve their stones in as short a period as 7 days. If the stone does not completely dissolve, it may not be composed entirely of struvite (calcium oxalate stones will not dissolve with diet) or there may be some other reason why the stone is not dissolving (the cat is sneaking food elsewhere, etc.). On average, it takes about 6 weeks for a stone to dissolve. If the stone does not seem to be dissolving after a reasonable time, it may require surgical removal. If the stone is successfully dissolved, a preventive diet will be needed to prevent new stones from forming. Treatment: Surgery Surgery to remove a bladder stone is called a cystotomy. Here, the bladder is opened and the stones inside are simply removed. The bladder and belly are closed up and the cat is able to go home when there is a good appetite and normal urination. Some blood in the urine can be expected for several days after surgery and there may be some urinary discomfort for the first several days that necessitate pain medication. After surgery, the stones are generally sent to a specific laboratory for analysis to confirm the stone type. Other Methods of Stone Retrieval Cystoscopy A less invasive method involves using a cystoscope in one of two ways. A cystoscope is a long, skinny instrument with a tiny video camera that can be inserted up the urethra and into the bladder. Because cats are so small, this is only possible in female cats; the male cat's urethra is simply too small for a cystoscope. Once inside the bladder, the scope uses a stone retrieval basket to capture small bladder stones and carry them out of the urethra when the scope is withdrawn. If the stone is too large to pass through the urethra, it can be broken apart using laser lithotripsy. Here, a laser on the cystoscope is placed in contact with the stone and the stone is broken into pieces that are small enough to either pass or be carried out in the retrieval basket. Obviously, special equipment is required in either of these situations and there is extra expense involved. That said, the recovery time is generally faster than with conventional surgery. Voiding Urohydropropulsion This technique can work if the stones are small enough to pass through the patient's urethra (so female cats only). The patient is sedated, the bladder is distended with fluid, agitated, and manually expressed under pressure. By positioning the sedated patient vertically, gravity "loads" the stones in the neck of the bladder, positioned for expulsion. When the bladder is expressed, often stones can be passed that might otherwise have stayed in the bladder. Larger stones cannot be passed using this technique. Often voiding urohydropropulsion is used to collect sample stones for laboratory analysis prior to one of the other stone removal techniques since identifying the stone type is crucial to selecting the removal technique. Prevention To avoid forming new struvite stones it is helpful to use a diet that creates a bladder environment that is not conducive to stone formation. There are numerous such urinary formulas and sometimes the same diet that was used to dissolve the stone can simply be continued. Ideally, a canned formula is used because canned foods have extra water and that helps make more dilute urine - and dilute urine means a lower crystal concentration. If it is not possible to feed an appropriate diet, the use of urinary acidifiers may be necessary. Your veterinarian may recommend some monitoring tests to make sure the pH and urine concentration stay in a range where struvite stones should not form.

Category: Blocked Cats are an Emergency
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When something happens to stem the flow of a cat's urine, trouble ensues - and fast. Urine has lots of good things in it. In many cases, they are substances that cats or people can’t live without, such as potassium, sodium, and water. The kidneys sense and adjust the composition of bodily fluids and drop the excess into the urine. If a person eats a large order of fries, covered with salt, the kidneys dump the unwanted excess of sodium into the urine. The same is true with many other substances, like water, that need to be regulated. Urine is (usually) sterile, so unless there is a urinary tract infection, urine is pure. It’s not the terrible stuff that many third graders make it out to be. True, it does have the waste products of metabolism in it, which a body needs to remove. And that’s where some of the problems begin. If the flow of urine stops, those waste products build up and negatively impact the way the body works. One of the most common ways that happens is when a cat’s urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the litter box) gets blocked. Known in veterinary parlance as a ‘blocked cat’ or ‘blocked tom,’ this poorly understood disorder is seen with alarming frequency in veterinary hospitals and ERs. Many ERs see about two to three cats per week who cannot urinate. Cats can be in all stages of the disease, from the early onset ones who just seem a little painful and have a big, hard bladder to the nearly dead ones that are in many cases beyond saving. The actual plug that stops the flow can be made of bladder stones (often erroneously called kidney stones), tumors or a gooey mix of mucus and protein known as ‘matrix’ that has the consistency of toothpaste. How and why matrix forms, no one knows, despite a few decades of investigation. Adding to the confusion, the name of the disorder has changed no less than four times in the past 20 years from feline lower urinary tract disorder (FLUTD) to feline urologic disorder (FUS) to feline interstitial cystitis (FIC) to the most recent iteration of Pandora Syndrome, which hasn’t really caught on yet. The causes go beyond a mucousy plug, as well. A host of other factors, such as stress, lack of access to water, diet, infectious agents, indoor lifestyle, and many other causes have been implicated as being responsible for the lead-up to getting blocked. Those little plugs don’t form in a vacuum: something causes them to form, and we don’t know with any certainty what factors contribute to it. Cats that are blocked often show the following signs: If you notice your cat showing any of the above signs, get right in to see your veterinarian or go to your nearest ER as soon as possible. Don’t delay as a few hours can make a big difference. The longer those toxins circulate unchecked, the more pain the cat experiences, the more work the veterinarian has to do, and the bigger the final bill will be. In advanced cases, where the urine flow has been stopped for more than 24 hours, cats can become systemically ill from retained toxins and start vomiting, or become very weak and lethargic. Death usually happens within 48 hours, and it’s not a pleasant way to go. The pain with this disease is immense, and some cat owners understandably choose euthanasia over trying to reestablish the flow of urine. The course after unblocking these cats is just as unpredictable and mysterious as the factors leading up to the obstruction; some cats are released from the hospital never to suffer another episode, while others will have repeated occurrences days, weeks or years later. This is an inhumane disease. Managing these cases medically can go way beyond relieving the obstruction in some cases. First priority is fixing the plumbing problem: getting urine to flow. This is usually done with anesthesia and a catheter to remove the obstruction. Managing the havoc wreaked by the toxins is next. This can necessitate some medical dancing as veterinarians try to put things back in place. Disorders of deadly potassium, elevated renal values, and severe dehydration can mean days in the hospital, even long after the urine is flowing again. It can get complex, expensive, and can wear down even the most committed of owners for the really medically complex (and expensive) ones. However, getting the urine to flow and taking the cat home is the easy part. After this episode, lifestyle changes are necessary: medication tweaks, medical rechecks, and diet changes that try to extend the initial complexity of this disease across months or years. Compared to 20 years ago, cats with this disease do go home and get better, even some of the tough cases.  Someday, science will provide an answer and veterinarians will have some means to prevent this disease in the first place, or some surefire way to treat it. Until then, rush your cat in to be seen if you see the signs.

Category: Kidney Dialysis: Is It for Your Pet?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources The kidney is a tremendous organizer of our small ions. It determines how much calcium to keep and how much to dump. It controls our blood's pH by controlling which acids and bases to keep and which to lose. It controls sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, water balance, and more.  The kidney filters unwanted toxic biochemicals and gets rid of them using a process called excretion. Not only are toxins removed, but they are removed using just the right amount of water so that hydration is maintained. In failure, however, everything goes haywire. The wrong things are dumped, the wrong things are kept, toxins build up and the patient is sick. The state of toxicity that results is called uremia or uremic poisoning. Almost every animal hospital can provide diuresis, therapy in which extra fluid beyond what the patient can drink is provided, thus giving the kidney a boost to remove toxic waste. This works well in a large number of patients but there comes a time when, even with plenty of fluids, the sick kidney simply cannot get the toxins out. For most patients, this is the end of the line. In fact, however, dialysis may be another choice. It must be understood that dialysis is substantially more expensive than diuresis, and centers that provide dialysis for pets are still few and far between. What Is Dialysis? Dialysis is a process that can be thought of as cleansing the blood of toxins. This is done using a membrane called a dialyzer membrane and a fluid called dialysate. The blood is separated from the dialysate by the dialyzer membrane. The dialysate fluid is formulated so that the toxins in the blood will be attracted across the dialyzer membrane and into the dialysate fluid. There are two types of dialysis: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. When most people refer to someone needing dialysis, they mean hemodialysis. The patient is hooked up to the dialysis machine by an intravenous catheter and a pump forces the patient's blood into the machine for cleansing. The detoxified blood is returned to the patient. Peritoneal dialysis is less high-tech and uses the patient's own abdomen as the dialyzer membrane. The belly is filled with dialysate fluid, toxins are attracted into the fluid over several hours and the fluid (with its toxins) is drained from the belly at the end of the procedure. Hemodialysis (Description and FAQ) The intravenous catheters used in hemodialysis are very large and very long so as to support the appropriate speed of blood flow through the dialyzer. The catheters are difficult to place so surgery may be necessary to do so. A long-term IV port under the skin may be needed if treatments are to be ongoing. A single catheter may be in place for months. The treatment lasts three to five hours, sometimes longer, during which the patient must calmly sit on a table attached to the equipment. Treatments typically are performed three times a week either indefinitely (as in chronic renal failure) or until the kidney has healed (as in acute renal failure). There are numerous conditions that will benefit from this type of blood cleansing besides kidney failure. Electrolyte imbalances, heart failure, and many poisonings can also be treated with hemodialysis. WhyIsThisSoLonginComingtoPets? Part of the problem has been that dialysis machines are generally designed for human patients. The amount of blood that goes through the human dialysis machine is too large a blood loss for a veterinary patient to withstand so smaller machines had to be built. A veterinary dialysis machine had to be designed for patients as small as a 5 or 6-pound cat. Furthermore, a dialysis center requires specifically trained staff and 24-hour staffing. It was and is difficult to get such facilities financed. The procedure is still expensive and requires a dedicated owner but at least it is now an option. How Often Is Dialysis Performed on a Patient? The patient who depends on dialysis to relieve the symptoms of uremia must have dialysis three times a week on average. The pet owner must be able to bring the pet to the dialysis center with this frequency and leave the pet for the several hours needed.Kidney transplantpatients, of course, only require dialysis until they are well enough for surgery. Patients with a stone obstructing a ureter (the tube connecting the kidney and bladder) will require dialysis until they are stable for surgery. Patients who have lost kidney function acutely from poisoning, usually antifreeze, or infection (usually leptospirosis) typically require a month of therapy while their kidneys heal. Other patients may require therapy indefinitely. Does Dialysis Reliably Control Uremic Poisoning? Not all patients respond to dialysis. How a given patient will do in part depends on what caused the kidney failure in the first place (toxin vs. infection vs. metabolic causes). Out of 138 dogs who failed to respond to conventional therapy for kidney failure — diuresis — at the University of California, 40% responded to dialysis. Infectious causes (generallyleptospirosis) tend to have a better prognosis. As leptospirosis has re-emerged as a common cause of canine acute kidney failure, the overall response rate for dogs receiving dialysis has improved to 50%. In a study in 2003 of cats requiring hemodialysis, the response rate was 56%; the best prognosis was for those with a ureter obstruction where over 70% survived. At What Point in Treatment Is Dialysis Recommended? If dialysis is being considered, it is best not to wait until conventional therapy has completely failed and the pet is on death's door. Let your veterinarian know from the start that this is an option you are interested in so that your veterinarian can consult with the dialysis center on the best time to refer. What Are the Complications and Disadvantages? A new world of complications (beyond those of conventionally managed kidney patients) is introduced to the kidney patient on dialysis. Malnutrition and NauseaThe toxin build-up in kidney failure causes nausea, and appetite loss follows. Toxins further cause ulcers in the stomach and intestine that contribute even more to the loss of appetite. Once the toxins are removed, the intestine heals quickly but appetite loss may persist. Making the nutrition issue worse is the fact that dialysis patients have an increased protein requirement and an increased calorie requirement. It is particularly important for the dialysis patient to get nutrients in one way or another. Feeding tubes or IV feeding may be necessary. Metabolic Bone DiseaseWhen the sick kidney does not properly get rid of phosphorus, calcium is mobilized in a complicated hormonal reaction. Dialysis patients appear to be at higher risk for broken bones than are conventionally-managed kidney patients. Carnitine DeficiencyCarnitine is a nutrient that facilitates the transport of the body's energy sources. Unfortunately, dialysis inherently depletes the patient of carnitine. Carnitine deficiency results in heart disease, low red blood cell count, and muscle weakness. Supplementation is often necessary for dialysis patients if dialysis is going to be regularly performed for periods longer than one month. Taurine DeficiencyTaurine is an amino acid of animal protein origin. As is the case with carnitine, taurine is lost in the process of dialysis. Taurine deficiency can result in heart disease and (in cats) blindness if it is allowed to persist. This amino acid must be supplemented for long-term dialysis patients. Problems with the Dialysis CatheterThe dialysis catheter may create a blood clot at the catheter tip. This can interfere with the high blood flow rates necessary for proper dialysis. When a clot occurs, a forceful flushing of the catheter may be enough to move it. If not, clot-dissolving medications must be used and this becomes expensive and may lead to inability to clot. Infection from the Dialysis CatheterAn infected dialysis catheter is bad news. The resulting blood infection can be lethal and, at best, requires months of antibiotic therapy. Be aware of reddening skin or pus at the catheter site. A fever is of great concern so become familiar with taking the pet's temperature. Continual Renal Replacement Therapy Continual renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is another form of blood filtration similar to dialysis; in fact, which procedure is the best choice for the human patient is hotly debated in human medicine. While dialysis removes toxins built up over the previous couple of days over a 3 to 5-hour treatment period, CRRT involves continual removal over a 24 to 48-hour period that mimics the patient's natural kidney function more closely. The idea here is to continually remove toxins until they are all gone if that is possible. Sometimes, a couple of treatments are needed. Unlike dialysis, CRRT is not a regularly performed procedure. The catheters are similar to the dialysis catheters, but because the procedure requires being hooked to the equipment for up to two days, sedation is generally required for this entire period, although this depends on the hospital. Lower blood flow rates are used in CRRT when compared to hemodialysis, which makes for fewer blood pressure issues. Also, the dialysis complications that are seen over time (carnitine deficiency, high dietary calorie requirement, catheter infection, and most of the other issues listed above) are not problems with CRRT because CRRT is a one-time treatment. Sedation may be necessary for CRRT, depending on the facility. Blood cleansing therapies such as these are still new to the veterinary field because their use is high maintenance and costly. Aspet insurancebecomes more popular, expense becomes less of a deterrent, so more facilities are likely to open up. At the present time, dialysis is chiefly used on a temporary basis for acute conditions, but as treatment becomes more available and affordable, more chronic patients are likely to come forward. If dialysis is something you want to consider, let your veterinarian know so that you can be directed to the appropriate specialist. Costs vary and will depend on your pet's health status, the number of treatments necessary, and the facility. Your veterinarian can refer you to the closest facility, andThe American Society of Veterinary Nephrology and Urology(specializing in the kidneys and the larger urinary system) offers a list of facilities in North America. We hope to add more centers as they open.

Category: Lower Urinary Tract Disease in Cats (also known as FLUTD)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources The diseased lower urinary tract yields the same symptoms regardless of the cause. A cat with lower urinary tract disease may have some or even all of these signs. The Trick is Determining the Cause The urinary bladder, urethra, and urinary opening all constitute the lower urinary tract. It makes sense that effective treatment requires knowing the cause of the symptoms. The problem is that just about any inflammatory condition in the feline lower urinary tract creates the same collection of signs. Tumors, infections, bladder stones, etc. all create the same clinical picture. What are the Possible Causes? It turns out that the age of the cat is tremendously relevant regarding which underlying causes are most likely. If we look at all cats with lower urinary tract symptoms, we find: If we separate the cats that are 10 years of age or older and only look at them, a different statistical picture emerges: Sorting Out Causes Testing is used to help sort patients into the correct group. A urinalysis is commonly performed. With a 50 percent incidence of infection in older cats, a urine culture would be extremely important for a cat age 10 or more but not as important for younger cats where the infection is rare.  In younger cats, a urinalysis is helpful to look for the typical blood and crystals of idiopathic cystitis or to pick up the occasional bladder infection. Radiographs (in cats young and old) to rule out bladder stones are a good idea as they will otherwise go undetected if imaging is not considered. Ultrasound is gaining popularity and can help screen for both tumors as well as bladder stones. Notice the large percentage of young adult cats for whom no clear underlying cause can be identified. For these cats, there are many theories on how to proceed. This syndrome has many causes. Use the links to guide you to other resources in these areas: It is critical to note that lower urinary symptoms in a male cat can indicate a urinary blockage, which is an emergency situation.If you are not sure if your cat can express urine,assume it could be an emergency and call your veterinarian’s office at once. See more aboutprevention. FLUTD is a complex disease, so knowing the cause of the disease guides the treatment. In other words, there is no common treatment or management. Your best source of information will come from your veterinarian as they know you and your cat's circumstances.

Category: Caring for Orphaned Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English So you’re the brand new parent to a litter of fuzzy, squeaky little kittens! Although nothing can replace the care from a feline mama, there are steps you can take to become an excellent foster parent until the kittens are ready to face the world. Note: Be sure not to assume that kittens you find outdoors are orphans! Mother cats often leave kittens for a few hours to look for food. Contact a veterinary or shelter professional or use this guide to figure out if kittens found outside need help.https://www.aspca.org/helping-people-pets/i-found-kittens-what-do-i-do Environment If possible, it is best to keep all the kittens in the litter together. They should be housed in a carrier or box small enough that they are nestled closely together with soft, clean bedding. This will help them maintain their body temperature. Kitten body temperature can change rapidly, so it is important to keep the environment at a consistent temperature. The room they are housed in should be between 68-72°F, and the inside of the box should be around 90°F in the first week of life, gradually going down to 75°F over the next several weeks. The box can be kept warm with a hot water bottle or a microwaveable heating disc (available online). Electric heating pads often heat unevenly and may even burn the kittens, so they are not advisable. Whatever method you choose, wrap it in a cloth or towel and place it in a corner of the box so that the kittens can move away if it is too warm. A heat lamp or incubator can also be used but should be far enough to one corner that kittens are not burned. Socialization The most sensitive period for socialization in a kitten’s life is between 2 and 7 weeks. During this time, kittens are most receptive to a variety of new experiences, which will help them become confident adults. Kittens should be handled by different people in the household for brief periods of time to get them used to human touch. Consider (gently!) rubbing ears, touching gums, and handling feet and nails to get them used to potentially scary situations they could face at a veterinarian’s office. Wash hands thoroughly before handling kittens. Feeding Feeding a carrier full of crying kittens can seem intimidating, but with the right tools and training, you can fill those hungry tummies in no time. Commercial kitten milk replacers are the best option for orphaned kittens. Cow’s milk and milk from other species generally have the wrong balance of fat, protein, and other nutrients for growing kittens. In an emergency or for extremely short term use, you can use the following recipe to make milk replacer at home - this is NOT for long-term use and can make kittens ill or keep them from growing well long term. Blend thoroughly, warm, and use. Commercial milk replacers are available as liquids or powders that need to be mixed with water before being given. Follow the instructions on the container. Only prepare the amount of milk needed for each feeding to make sure that bacteria doesn’t grow in it. Warm the milk replacer in a bowl of hot water instead of the microwave, as that can heat the formula unevenly. You can make sure the milk isn’t too hot to drink by placing a small drop on your skin. Kittens should not be fed if their body temperature is less than 35.5°C/96°F. If their temperature is lower than this, attempt to warm them with blankets and hot water bottles before feeding. Low body temperature can be very dangerous, so if you are unable to warm them back up to 98°-100°, take them to your veterinarian. Each kitten will need about 20-26 milliliters of milk replacer for every 100 grams of their body weight each day. Break up the total quantity of milk to be given in 2-3 milliliters for every 100 grams of body weight so as not to overfill their stomachs. You can use this chart to estimate how much milk to feed your kitten depending on their weight. Since milk replacers and feeding techniques can vary, it is important to weigh your kitten daily, record their weight, and adjust how much you feed based on how their weight is changing. Kittens should be gaining roughly 10-15 grams every day until they are weaned. If you would like more information on how to read and use a syringe, you can use the detailed guide linked below. Check with your veterinarian if you have more questions.https://childrenswi.org/-/media/chwlibrary/publication-media-library/2020/03/30/19/56/1619en.pdf Bottle Feeding You can buy nursing bottles for kittens online or in pet stores. They will generally need a hole or slit cut in the nipple. The hole should be big enough to allow a drop to form when held upside down without applying any pressure to the bottle. Feed the kitten in an upright position with her head slightly elevated (NOT on her back like a human baby – that is not their natural feeding position!). Do not squeeze the bottle as the kitten is suckling. Tube Feeding Tube feeding may be necessary for kittens who are unable or unwilling to suckle, but it can be risky. This is different from feeding tubes that are put in surgically, which you may have seen in other pets or in human patients. A soft tube is gently inserted a soft tube into the kitten's stomach from their mouth to feed them, and then remove the tube at the end of each feeding. Improper tube feeding can cause aspiration pneumonia, a condition where food is inhaled into the lungs and causes an infection. This is life-threatening. Do not try to tube feed without first being instructed to do so and trained by the veterinary staff! Regardless of which method you use, disinfect all your materials after each feeding. You can buy baby bottle sterilizing solutions online or at department stores. Flush thoroughly with water before using the solution. Elimination Kittens less than 3-4 weeks will not use the restroom on their own. Normally, after feeding, the mother cat encourages kittens to relieve themselves by licking the genitals and the anus. In orphaned kittens, you will need to stimulate elimination by gently wiping the area with a soft, damp cloth after each feeding. Check to make sure that the urine and feces look normal. Urine is usually almost transparent or pale yellow, while feces are soft and yellow. Constipation and Diarrhea Both constipation and diarrhea are relatively common in hand-reared kittens. If kittens have not had a bowel movement for more than a day, it may be a result of not enough liquid in the milk replacer or not enough stimulation to the anus after feedings. Your veterinarian can supply you with oral laxatives or perform an enema to help your kitten pass stool if necessary. Contact your veterinarian if your kitten has not defecated in over 2 days. Diarrhea can cause fluid loss quite quickly and can result in low blood sugar or dehydration. Contact your veterinarian if diarrhea continues for over a day. Weaning Kittens are weaned between weeks 3 and 4. You can start to offer them high-quality wet kitten food mixed in with warm water or milk replacer. Be sure to offer food in a flat or shallow plate and feed the same type of wet food all through weaning. Monitoring Health A kitten’s health can change very quickly from day to day, especially in sensitive time periods such as immediately after birth and weaning. Keeping a thorough record of your litter’s health will help you catch and address problems early. Record important information like weight, food intake, behavior, restroom habits, etc. each day. If you can't tell the kittens apart, put nail polish on their nails using a different color for each kitten. Upper Respiratory Infections Upper respiratory infections are viral diseases that spread from kitten to kitten, especially when they are stressed or crowded. Symptoms can vary from cold-type signs, like sneezing and coughing, to swollen, infected eyes. If appropriate, your veterinarian can provide antimicrobials or supportive care for infected kittens. Fleas, Ticks, and Parasites Fleas can cause severe anemia in small kittens and should be treated promptly. Fipronil spray products (e.g. Frontline) can be used in kittens 2 days and older. Apply the spray to a cotton ball or cloth first, then rub on the kitten’s body, avoiding the face, genitals, and anus. You can also control a flea infestation by flea combing regularly. If your kittens have a flea infestation, assume that the environment does too and treat carpets and bedding with a product like Fleabusters Rx powder. Pyrantel pamoate can be given after 2 weeks of age to treat intestinal worms. Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia) Low blood sugar is common in kittens because they are still too young to store enough glucose in their bodies. Glucose is extremely important for many tissues to function properly, including the brain and the nervous system. Low blood sugar may cause weakness and lethargy and it can become life-threatening. A hypoglycemic kitten will need to get supportive care with sugar solutions until their blood glucose comes up to normal. Contact your veterinarian immediately if you suspect a kitten has low blood sugar. Cross Suckling Some kittens, especially those without mothers, will try to suckle on one another. Searching and suckling are both natural behaviors for kittens, but when they suck on one another’s stomachs or genitals, they can cause a lot of damage. If you notice your kittens suckling on one another, try to provide more options for them to suck on, like nipples attached to a board or a rubber mat. You can place clothing on the kittens as long as it isn’t so tight that it keeps them from moving, and it doesn’t have any elastic that can apply pressure. Separating the kittens isn’t ideal because they need social stimulation, especially if they don’t have a mother, but it may be necessary if cross-suckling can’t be corrected otherwise. Fading Kitten Syndrome A "fading" kitten is one who fails to thrive - they may cry out excessively even after being fed, appear weak or lethargic, or refuse to suckle. This syndrome can be caused by a number of factors including genetics, infections, and issues during birth. Regardless of the cause, fading kitten syndrome is dangerous and these kittens can rapidly decline. Your veterinarian can help provide supportive care to these ill kittens, so don't hesitate to ask for help if you suspect a kitten's behavior or health has changed. Caring for orphaned kittens is not always easy, but it can be very rewarding. Hand-rearing kittens is an imperfect practice and there is always a chance that they will begin to feel unwell. By monitoring their health closely and promptly addressing health issues as they arise, you can help keep your foster kittens happy and growing.

Category: Feline Pregnancy and Kitten Birth
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Too often, a litter of kittens comes as an almost total surprise. The cute little girl kitten from last fall is one day noticed to be a bit round in the middle only the very next spring. No one got around to spaying her and she seemed too young for – er – adult entertainment. Now we have a quandary: shall we have the kittens or not? It is not too late for spaying, even fairly late in pregnancy, and there is a spectacular over-population of cats. As tempting as it may be to extend the family with just one litter of kittens, please do not think of them as your grandchildren in feline form. There are plenty of adoptable feline grandchildren in the shelters and adoption groups, so we encourage you to spay, even during established pregnancy. That said, the rest of this article concerns feline reproduction and neonatal care. We will assume you have decided to have the kittens anyway and will find them responsible homes, or perhaps this was a planned breeding from the start. Read more on thefeline spay. How This Happened in the First Place: Baby Girl Grows up Many people are surprised to find that the feline reproductive system is seasonal. Cats are designed to give birth only during warm months (spring through early fall). While not every female cat follows this rule to the letter, in general, cats are reproductively inactive when the days are short, and they begin their hormonal cycles annually when they perceive the days to be getting longer. The female cat begins cycling when she has reached 80% of her adult size and when the days are appropriately long. This could be as young as four months of age. After age seven or eight years, cycles become irregular, and there are more complications with birth, so it is important to finish a female cat’s breeding career before this time. Indoor cats are sheltered from the light cycles of the sun and may not cycle as frequently as their outdoor counterparts. On the other hand, breeders who keep their cats completely indoors can manipulate the light cycle of the cattery so as to allow for year-round cycling if desired. ProestrusThis is the time in the cycle when the female begins attracting males but is not yet receptive to their advances. Estrogen is building up, and she is preparing for ovulation. The female is extra affectionate at this time, rubbing her head and sticking her rump in the air. She may also urine mark in the house and vocalize loudly and frequently. This period may be as short as 12 hours and as long as two days. EstrusThe female cat’s behavior continues: rubbing, crying, etc., but the difference here is that the male is accepted when he approaches. This behavior persists for approximately seven days (on average), and during that time, the female’s behavior is often objectionable to the owner. Contrary to previous belief, the act of mating does not shorten the estrus period (though it does substantially lengthen the time before the next estrus period). The female cat is ready to ovulate at this time but, in general, will not do so unless a male cat breeds her. Interestrous PeriodThis is the period between times of behavioral estrus. If the cat is not bred or is bred and fails to ovulate, this time period is eight to 10 days on average. This means that the yowling, rubbing, urine marking, and other estrous behaviors continue for about a week, then discontinue for about a week, then begin again, back and forth all spring and summer and into the fall until the cat is either bred, spayed, or perceives the coming of winter. This behavior of the mature female cat is often all the motivation it takes for an owner to get her spayed, even if she is completely confined indoors and has no chance of unwanted pregnancy. DiestrusIf the female is bred and ovulates, she goes into this different reproductive stage. Her ovaries prepare for possible pregnancy, and she will stay out of heat for at least 35 to 37 days even if she is not pregnant. If she is pregnant, she will carry her kittens for 64 to 66 days before delivering the litter. If, for some reason, spaying is desired but must be delayed, and yet the estrous behavior is driving the owner crazy, the cat may be fooled into thinking she has been bred through manipulation with a rectal thermometer. If you are interested in this procedure, contact your veterinarian as it is not as simple as it may sound but is often effective in providing peace at home. How this Happened in the First Place, Part 2: The Lovers The female cat in estrus is a flirtatious creature. She seeks territory that has been urine-marked by the male of her choice. (If the breeding is planned, it is generally best to bring the female to the male’s territory to approximate the natural situation.) She approaches the male, rubbing, nuzzling, etc. If she is in a receptive period of her cycle, she will allow him to bite the nape of her neck and will give him about 30 seconds to complete his sexual act. She typically yowls loudly during this time. The female immediately becomes refractory and attacks the male, who backs off to wait for another chance. The female reaction to breeding involves obsessive rolling around on the ground and vaginal licking. After a few minutes, she is ready for more and will indicate this by rubbing on him or patting gently at him. With each breeding, the time until the next attempt grows longer but may continue all day long. Diagnosis of Pregnancy The owner may notice that the unspayed female is rounder than usual and that her nipples have become prominent (called pinking up). This may not be noticeable until well into advanced pregnancy, depending on how observant the owner is, how large the litter is, etc. There are several ways to confirm feline pregnancy. Blood TestThe Witness Pregnancy Test is approved for both canine and feline use and can be performed in about 15 minutes at your veterinarian’s office. She must be about 30 to 35 days into the pregnancy for this. UltrasoundUltrasound can readily confirm pregnancy at approximately 22-25 days of pregnancy but is not readily available in all animal hospitals. Ultrasound cannot accurately determine how many kittens to expect, and this is important information best obtained with a radiograph later on. Ultrasound can, however, be used to determine the delivery date for the kittens by measuring the head and body. RadiologyAt about 45 days of pregnancy, the kittens will have mineralized their skeletons and be visible on an x-ray. This is the only procedure that reliably can determine how many kittens to expect. PalpationSome veterinarians can feel the developing kittens between days 17 and 25. Care During Pregnancy The female cat has relatively few needs during pregnancy. She will need a food that is approved for growth (i.e., a food appropriate for kittens) as she will need the extra calories, particularly after delivery when she is nursing. Her metabolic demand during nursing will triple, and she will especially need the extra calories then. Flea control is important during pregnancy as flea anemia is one of the leading causes of death in neonatal kittens. Find an appropriate flea product approved for use in feline pregnancy. Do not vaccinate a pregnant cat. Hopefully, her vaccinations were current prior to pregnancy. Developing kittens are vulnerable to live viruses used in modified live virus vaccinations, feline distemper in particular. The female cat, either infected in pregnancy or vaccinated with live virus during pregnancy, can produce kittens with a specific birth defect calledcerebellar hypoplasia, a brain malformation that leads to tremors and wobbling, particularly when the cat is attempting a specific task (the so-called “intention tremor.”) Most mother cats will seek their own nesting area in the last week or so of pregnancy. If you wish to help her, expect her to require soft bedding, an area with minimal human traffic, and separation from other pets in the home. Labor Several hours (and perhaps a whole day) of restlessness, grooming, nesting, pacing, panting, vomiting, and crying indicates that labor has begun. Like the dog, there is often a drop in body temperature (to less than 99 degrees F), indicating contractions will commence in the next 12 to 36 hours but this is not as reliable a finding as in the female dog. The female cat secludes herself in her selected nest area and begins to purr. The above first stage of labor progresses to the second stage of labor with the initiation of hard contractions and the birth of a kitten. The third stage of labor refers to the passing of the placenta. The entire litter is born usually within six hours, with kittens every 30 to 60 minutes. If she is stressed or distracted, she is able to stop her labor and restart the next day. The new mother usually eats the placenta and membranes of the kitten’s sac. There is no special benefit to this behavior, so if you wish, you may remove these tissues from the nest and prevent her from eating them, but if you plan to cut the umbilical cord so as to disconnect the kitten from the placenta, be careful not to tug on the umbilical cord as this can damage the baby's internal organs. Do not attempt to move her and the kittens to a “better” nest spot after labor has started. This may stress her into curtailing her labor or, worse may scare her into neglecting the litter. Strong contractions for more than 60 minutes without producing a kitten indicate she needs help and should see the veterinarian right away. Most of the time, labor is normal and goes off without a hitch. Kittens may begin eating solid food around age four weeks of age and may be adopted to new homes at age eight weeks. Vaginal discharge is normal for up to three weeks postpartum. This discharge is typically black or reddish and consists mostly of old blood. If the discharge seems particularly bloody, have the veterinarian assess her blood loss. If the discharge looks like pus, she may have a uterine infection. Bring her to the veterinarian; she may need to be spayed right away. Complications Surrounding Labor and Pregnancy Vaginal BleedingVaginal bleeding during pregnancy is not normal and suggests that she is aborting the litter. If this is occurring late in pregnancy (the eighth week), she may be delivering the litter prematurely, and a cesarean section is likely necessary. In either case, have the veterinarian check her to assess the blood loss and decide what to do. DystociaIf she has been having strong contractions for more than 60 minutes, she needs assistance in passing the kitten. Bring her and any kittens delivered to the veterinarian’s office right away. Retained Placenta/MetritisIf the mother cat retains the placenta, she can develop an infection, fever, or appetite loss, and neglect the kittens. If this occurs, she will need to see the veterinarian right away, possibly be hospitalized, and will probably need to be spayed to remove the infection. Neonatal IsoerythrolysisIf the mother cat has Type B blood and the kittens have Type A blood, antibodies in the mother's milk will destroy the kitten's red blood cells. This is only preventable if you know the mother’s blood type in advance (most cats are Type A, but certain breeds commonly have Type B blood). Kittens in this situation can be saved if they do not nurse from their natural mother. See more information aboutneonatal isoerythrolysis. Getting her Spayed at Last Many people are surprised by their cat’s pregnancy and do not really want the kittens, but since she is pregnant, choose to go ahead with the litter, intending to spay her when the kittens are weaned. The female cat may have other plans. Nursing the litter generally suppresses the return to cycling, but the average female cat is back in heat about a month after delivery of the litter. If she has access to a male cat, she will likely become pregnant before she is finished weaning the current litter. Ideally, she should be confined until she can be spayed and should be spayed a month or so after the kittens have stopped nursing. The reason for this is to allow the mammary tissue to dry up and go back to a more normal, less vascular state. Spaying the female while her glands are still full leads to more bleeding and more difficult surgery. If the choice comes down to spaying her with mammary development versus having an unwanted litter, however, spaying is a better choice. Raising Orphans Sometimes, you are faced with a litter that is too large for one mother cat to handle, or disaster may strike, leaving the kittens motherless. See full instructions on what to get and do in order to successfullyraise a litter of orphan kittens. When the Mother Cat is Feral A feral animal is a member of a domestic species (such as a cat) who is living wild. If kittens are captured prior to age 10 weeks, they can usually be tamed and become normally socialized to human contact. After this age, socialization is much more challenging. Feral adult cats are often best left living in the wild world despite its hazards. This does not mean that they should be allowed to freely reproduce, however. “Trap-Neuter-Release" (TNR) is a program that allows for humane management of a feral cat colony and has become official policy in many communities.

Category: How to Find a Good, Responsible Breeder
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  People seek out purebred dogs and cats for a number of reasons. Previous experience with the breed; predictability of temperament or health; use in hunting, agility, obedience, or other work are just a few. Many purebred animals are found in animal shelters and rescue organizations. Breed-specific rescues only take in a specific breed, or mixes of that one breed. Once in a while they have puppies and kittens available for adoption, but not usually. If these avenues are not turning up any animals of your preferred breed, you might then choose to look for a breeder. Not all breeders are alike, so look for specific criteria to satisfy yourself that the breeder is responsible. Primarily, avoid any commercial breeder that displays the hallmarks of being a puppy mill. They are large-scale commercial breeding operations, usually for dogs (although the term can also be applied for large-scale catteries), where profit is the only thought. The temperament and health of any one animal or their parents is of no concern. The hundreds of animals are bred too often and in substandard, sometimes filthy, accommodations. Most pet store animals are sourced from operations that can be classified as puppy mills. Generally speaking, these operations are where you will find the least expensive animals because they are merely a commodity to the breeder. When buying puppies or kittens, it's usually true that you get what you pay for. Puppy mill dogs tend to be timid, fearful, and unhealthy throughout their lives, costing you a lot in emotional terms and at the veterinary hospital. You will likely spend less in veterinary bills over the pet's life by purchasing from a responsible breeder. A good, responsible breeder is one who cares about their animals-and you as their potential family-more than their own profit. A good breeder wants their animals to be placed in the best possible homes. The cost may seem high, but there is a significant investment by breeders in breeding responsible litters. This may include participating in conformation shows (which is where “champions” come from), testing for medical certifications, selectively planning litters that will improve the breed, keeping up with veterinary care needed during breeding and pregnancy, and finding good homes for their animals. Good breeders make little, if any, profit and do it for love of the breed. While many breeders look like they do the right thing on paper, that may not always true. Be wary of buying from people who only want to breed a litter because they know a friend has a purebred male for their female, or who want to have a litter so that their children can see "the magic of birth just once". They may produce good offspring, and they may not. Understand that being registered only means the pet has a purebred pedigree from the presiding organization for that animal. Being registered means nothing in terms of their health or temperament. Your Search Do your research before you look at a litter. It is impossible to make rational decisions while surrounded by adorable puppies or kittens! Good breeders Purchasing a pet through a reputable breeder takes time. Most reputable breeders have fewer than one to two litters per year. Good breeders also have waiting lists of potential buyers because experienced buyers know that a well-bred pet is worth the wait and cost. You are not likely to decide to buy a purebred animal one week and be able to pick one up the next without resorting to a pet store or puppy mill. One important hallmark of a good breeder is that if at any time during the pet's life you discover you cannot keep the animal, the breeder will take them back. This willingness means they care deeply about what happens to the animals they decide to bring into the world. A good breeder also tries to determine if you are the right kind of person to live with that breed. Don't be surprised when breeders ask you as many questions as you are asking them. Buyer Beware Once the purchase of a pet is complete, no breeder has the right to micro-manage your pet's diet or health care unless you co-own the animal. Be wary of breeders who seem opposed to you seeking your own veterinary care or have an antagonistic attitude towards veterinarians in general. A breeder may require you to sign a contract stating that you will feed a specific diet or give specific supplements. Some may stipulate which vaccines or parasite prevention to give (or not give) and when. Some may dictate the time frame in which to spay or neuter your pet, or even require/forbid specific anesthetic or drug protocols for the surgery. Some contracts require you to agree to intermittent in-home welfare checks, or to seek the breeder's permission before euthanizing your pet for any reason. Signing contracts like these is a bad idea, even if they may not be legally enforceable. The pet, and all the decisions related to their care, is legally yours. Your pet is an individual, and their medical decisions should be resolved between you and your veterinarian. Obviously, your breeder will be a good resource for health recommendations for their particular breed; however, insisting that you do something their way rather than what you and your veterinarian think best is inappropriate. When you are looking for a purebred puppy or kitten, for your own protection, don't buy from anyone who: You will be living with this pet for many years, and you want the most appropriate animal for that place in your heart: the best temperament, the best health, the best chances, and the least risk. Just because an animal is registered as a purebred does not mean it's a great pet: it's the breeder who makes the difference. Start by buying that puppy or kitten from a breeder who only wants what is best for the animals they're sharing with you.

Category: Neonatal Isoerythrolysis in Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Imagine this tragic scenario. A mother cat carries her litter normally and gives birth to a healthy litter of kittens. She cleans them, nurses them, cares for them but within a few days they have all weakened and died. This may happen litter after litter with the cattery breeder wondering what went wrong. While there are many reasons why newborn kittens might not survive, this particular condition is preventable. Neonatal isoerythrolysis is a tragedy among breeders of kittens and is often written off as infectious disease, genetic defects, or simply natural selection. In fact, it is simply a matter of mismatched blood typing. A Human Example: Rh Disease Many of us know our blood type: it is either A, B, O, or AB and comes with a negative or positive after it. It is the negative or positive that is important when it comes to HUMAN isoerythrolysis. The negative or positive in your blood type refers to whether you are negative or positive for a red blood cell protein called Rh factor, named for the Rhesus monkeys used in initial studies of this disease. Problems do not occur when both parents are Rh positive or Rh negative, or even when the father is Rh negative and the mother is Rh positive. Problems occur with a certain combination. When a man who is positive for Rh factor fathers a child with a woman who is negative for Rh factor, the child will be Rh positive. When the mother gives birth, her immune system becomes exposed to the baby’s blood. Her immune system mounts a response against Rh factor and soon she is armed with anti-Rh factor antibodies. This is not a problem for the first-born child. It is secondary children who are in danger. When the mother is pregnant again with another Rh positive child, the antibodies of her bloodstream cross the placenta and destroy her unborn child’s developing red blood cells. The unborn child will likely die. Luckily, this condition is preventable by first being aware of your Rh status when you become pregnant, and by receiving a product called RhIg when the first child is born. RhIg is an anti-Rh factor antibody that destroys any Rh factor entering the mother’s body at the time of the first birth. The Rh factor is destroyed before the mother’s immune system “sees it,” thus preventing her from producing the antibodies that would attack her second child’s blood. See more information onhuman Rhdisease. The Feline Disease Cats do not have Rh factor but a similar parental blood mismatch can occur involving the feline blood types A, B, and AB blood. Cats with type A blood naturally carry antibodies against type B blood and cats with type B blood naturally have antibodies against type A blood. These antibodies do not need exposure to another cat's blood during birth (as with human Rh disease) or from an incompatible transfusion; those antibodies are just naturally there, ready to attack the opposite blood type. It turns out that only some type A cats carry anti-B antibodies and the the ones that do only carry small amounts. On the other hand, all type B cats carry a lot of anti-A antibodies. When a type B mother cat is carrying a litter of type A kittens, the stage is set for disaster. In people, antibodies cross the placenta and cause damage to the unborn baby. In cats, the placenta blocks the antibodies and protects the litter but there is no natural protection once they are born and have to nurse their type B mother's milk. More specifically, the problem happens when they nurse their mother's colostrum, which is naturally loaded with antibodies aimed at destroying type A red blood cells. The feline A,B,AB system is not comparable to the human A,B,O blood typing system. In people, inheriting a Type A gene and a Type B gene creates Type AB blood. In the cat, the Type A is dominant to all other blood types. Any Type A genes will create a Type A cat. This means that when a Type A cat is bred to a Type B cat, each kitten has at least a 50% chance of being Type A. What is Colostrum? Colostrum is milk produced by the mother of any mammal species for the first 12-24 hours or so. The first day of life is extra special for baby mammals as this is the time when the mother gives them a copy of her own immunity. The milk produced in this period is rich with all the antibodies the mother has to give: vaccination-generated antibodies, antibodies from exposure to all sorts of proteins she has experienced or infections she has survived, and, of course, antibodies against the “wrong” blood type. The infant’s intestine is in a sensitive time during this period. The antibodies delivered in the mother’s colostrum are not digested like regular proteins; instead, they are absorbed intact and provide the basis for the baby’s protection against infectious disease until the baby’s immune system is mature enough to make its own antibodies. After the first day of life, the intestine achieves what is called closure and no more such absorption takes place. After closure, any proteins that enter the GI tract are broken down as nutrients. The Type B mother cat is giving a great big dose of anti-A antibodies right into her Type A kittens with her colostrum and the babies are absorbing it into their bodies. The antibodies destroy the kittens’ developing red blood cells; they get pale, perhaps even jaundiced. They get weaker and weaker and then they die, poisoned by their own mother’s milk. Prevention and Saving the Litter As with human Rh disease, the first step in prevention is awareness. If you are going to breed purebred cats, have their blood types tested before they are bred. This can be done at the vet’s office with a test kit and can often be done while you wait. Ideally, a type B mother cat would only be bred to a type B tomcat. Type B feline blood is somewhat unusual in the mixed-breed domestic short hair population, but it is fairly common in purebred cats, particularly the Asian breeds. Type A is genetically dominant to type B so that the mating of a type B mother to a type A father will produce at least a 50 percent chance of type A kitten. So what do we do about the kittens already on the way? The key to survival is to keep the kittens from drinking their mother’s colostrum. As soon as they are born, they must be removed from the mother cat and either nursed by another mother cat or bottle-fed (seeOrphan Kitten Carefor full instructions). They can be returned to their real mother after her colostrum production is over. This ought to be 12-18 hours but keep them away for a full day just to be sure. Regular mother’s milk produced after this time is not a hazard as the antibodies will be digested by the babies. During that first 24-hour period, the kittens may nurse on a Type A mother cat or can be bottled or tube fed. As for the immunity lost by giving up colostrum, there is a next best thing: a plasma transfusion. Feline plasma of the correct blood type can be given to the kittens by injection. (Kittens can be blood typed using cord or placenta blood if one wishes to avoid a needle stick in such a tiny patient.) This blood product will contain many protective antibodies and none of the harmful ones. It is not as good as type-matched colostrum, but is fairly available in most animal blood banks. Sick kittens may survive if they are given blood transfusions but the problem is knowing which blood type to use. The kittens want type A blood but if their mother's antibodies are still present, this will not work. The proper treatment is going to depend on how old the kittens are at the time of diagnosis. If they are less than 3 days of age, a transfusion of their mother's type B red blood cells may be the best choice even though the kittens are type A. Blood Typing Feline blood typing can be performed by most animal hospitals. If a litter of kittens is planned, see your veterinarian about at least typing the mother cat so that you can plan ahead for complications. Neonatal isoerythrolysis is a preventable syndrome but only if it is anticipated.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The Nest Box Keep the babies together as long as they are about the same age; this will help socialize them to their own species and will help in keeping them warm. Try to assemble the following equipment. If the baby's temperature drops below 94⁰F, the heart rate drops and intestinal motion ceases.Death occurs if this is not corrected. Initial warming when babies have gotten cold should take place over an hour or two to avoid shock. The Diet Makeshift Formula Until Commercial Formula can be Obtained Puppies1 cup whole milk1 tsp. salad oil1 drop multi-vitamins (if you have any)2 egg yolks Kittens1/2 cup whole milk1 egg yolk1 drop multi-vitamins3 crushed Tums (antacid) For either one, then mix in a blender. The Bottle How / When To Feed Tube feeding involves using a syringe and lubricated tube to introduce formula through the mouth and directly into the stomach. Your veterinarian will need to show you how to do this should it become necessary. A baby who rejects three meals in a row will need tube feeding. Urination / Defecation Expect the baby to need stimulation for urination/defecation for the first three weeks of life. Bathing How to be Sure You Are on Track Starting Solid Food The best way to be sure everything is going well is to track weight gain in your new babies. A postal scale or food scale (ideally one that measures weight in grams) will be helpful. A puppy or kitten should gain 10% of the birth weight every day and should be drinking 22 to 26 cc of formula per 100 grams of body weight over the course of the day. Puppies are variable in growth expectancy depending on breed, but kittens are more predictable and should gain 50 to 100 grams weekly. Kittens weighing less than 90 grams (approx three ounces) at birth have a high (59%) mortality rate. A Note on Colostrum Colostrum is the first milk produced by the mother shortly after giving birth. It is rich in antibodies which will protect the babies for the first several months of life. Colostrum is only produced for a day or two and the baby is only able to absorb its antibodies for a day or two. Without colostrum (if their mother did not nurse the kittens during the first two days of life) the babies have a serious immunological disadvantage. Especially great care should be taken in cleanliness and the babies can be vaccinated as early as age two weeks depending on circumstances. They may require a plasma transfusion to make up for the colostrum. There is no substitute for a real mother. See more information onraising orphan kittens. Many foster parents have difficulty distinguishing male and female kittens at this early age. See someguidelines and (illustrated) instructions.

Category: Reproductive Cycle of Cats May Surprise You
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Editor's note: Not all veterinarians agree that spaying cats at this age decreases the cat population. Talk to your veterinarian about your pet.) There is a thoughtful new movement designed to get to the next and final phase of ending domestic annual over production of kittens. The over-production problem is becoming known in animal shelters as thekitten tsunami, which occurs each late spring/early summer. The solution is preventing successful winter mating season through timely sterilization.  I will not recount the number of advantages of feline sterilization (spay/neuter.)  Most reading this already know them.  But what is not generally known is the female feline reproductive cycle.  That cycle, when understood, is the driving force behind the spay by 4 or 5 months of age championed by several profile groups. Caring pet providers, who do not want to allow the nearly inevitable unplanned and unwanted pregnancy to occur, must request the fail-safe spay before the predictable breeding season arrives.  That means all moms of this past year and all new potential queens by 5 months of age should have their once-in-a-lifetime sterilization surgery. December 21:Winter begins (the shortest day of the year)Each day becomes a little longer. The longer day triggers the process called estrous (heat). Some queens will exhibit signs of estrous from as early as late January. Certainly by mid-February queens 5 months or older may be ready for a tom. The clock starts. Once bred it is:2 months gestation = birth2 months nursing = weaning+3 months = kittens maturing5 months of age (August/Sept.) March 20:Spring beginsBirthing begins with a few litters then crescendos with activity.  Cats are in heat, pregnant, (with short rest between heats) or nursing.  Peak time here is May, June and July: shelter kitten tsunami, considering the weaning time is around 8 weeks (2 months) of age. June 21:Summer begins (The longest day of the year)At this time of year the days are getting shorter.  Estrous is easing with a lot of overlap here.  A number of surprised caregivers are now scheduling spays though the damage is already done.  The “oops” (unplanned) litters are often now a problem.  What is to become of all those kittens.  Moms should be spayed 2 to 3 weeks after weaning or when the breasts have receded. September 23:Fall beginsThe days are now short enough that estrous (heat) is pretty much on seasonal hold.  Peace generally prevails and by mid-October estrous is down to zero. This year’s kittens are on the edge and not likely to be signaled into estrous. Even female kittens in February will probably not go into estrous this year, but all females this year will do so this upcoming breeding season. Spay by 5 months before winter solstice. Note: The best holiday gift for your cat is a trip to the veterinarian for neutering (whether male or female.) Let's put this basic nature's plan for cats into an organized and useful outline.  Let's start with all queens in the non-sexually active state = December.   December 21stis the start of the winter season, marking the shortest day of the year with each succeeding day becoming longer.  The incremental increasing lengths of daylight that begin after December 21stare being received through the eye and sent by the queen's optic nerve to signal this fact to the pituitary gland which, in turn, makes a hormone signaling the ovary that it's time to make follicles.  Pretty amazing.  The follicles, of course, make the eggs and estrogen.  It is the estrogen that makes the queen into what we see: a vocal tom-seeking maniac. The mating season is on! The toms, of course, are always ready and willing to serve.  This magical time will begin toward the end of January and becomes full blown by mid-February.  The domestic queen is an induced ovulator, meaning, when copulation takes place the severe stimulation of the mating process causes the follicles to rupture.  The eggs and estrogen are then released.  Now, two things are certain: she goes out of heat and there is guaranteed timing in which the sperm finds eggs.  Thus begins 61 - 63 days of gestation. So now let's look at the next season (spring, March 20thbegins the gestation/delivery/ nursing season).  By this time all unspayed queens are in various stages of the active breeding cycle.  Early estrous queens who mated in January will be delivering their litters starting in mid-March.  This is followed by a crescendo of successful matings resulting in more and more females who will be delivering.  There are those queens who were kept under house arrest and avoided the male encounter.  However, felines not mated often restart estrous within a few weeks for round two. Whenever a queen mates, it is 61-63 days later that an average of 3 to 5 kittens are born.  Then 2 months (8-9 weeks) later, the kittens are weaning and the caretaker may decide to keep them or try to re-home them.  If unsuccessful, ultimately the heart wrenching decision is made to take them to the shelter.  Shelters call May, June, and July the kitten tsunami season as there are multiple litters arriving per day.  Of course, while kittens are nursing and growing they are a delight to watch.  Their placement two months after delivery now becomes an acute dilemma for shelters. Days begin shortening on June 21st, which is also the first day of summer, and there are kittens and cats of all stages and ages.  Some queens will get pregnant a second time.  With house arrest or just luck the first estrous will subside but if mating did not occur, the female's heat will restart and toms have had a second chance.  If she appears out of heat it could well be she is actually pregnant in which case, of course, the queen will soon look pregnant (distended abdomen). The traditional calendar reports September 23rdas the beginning of fall season.  Pretty much by the end of August, cycling (periods of heat) has stopped.  Closure proceeds normally for the development of the last of this past year's nursing and weaning.  Thus, fall is a blessed period of general feline tranquility until the next winter breeding season begins.  Kittens are growing and moms gain weight back. So there's the basic outline of what and when the forces of nature make the queens (young and older) do what they do.  Personal experiences may differ somewhat but this outline encompasses the vast majority of them.  Some obvious factors may change some of the timing; e.g.; caretakers in the southerly states are going to recognize this pattern; northern states may find the seasons are shorter; whereas in Hawaii the season is almost year round kitten time.  Indoor cats with artificial lighting can have their heat cycles affected by their caretakers' personal use of lighting. Armed with those time frames and the combination of age at a given season we know that young queens can come into estrous as early as 4 to 5 months and for sure by 6 months.  This means spaying by 5 months is good insurance against "oops" litters.   A little thing like "I forgot to make an appointment" or simple procrastination can happen far too easily in our busy lives. What is absolute is that any of the female kittens born into any year's reproductive cycle will be more than ready to respond to nature's wake-up call by the winter's increasing daylight.  There is plenty of evidence that unintended litters are born simply because the queens were not spayed.  Don't let your charge be one who adds to the kitten tsunami. The sheer number of veterinarians who sterilize cats younger than 6 months and the reported ease of surgery, safety and rapid recovery makes spaying at 4 or 5 months of age a sound practice.  By performing surgery by 5 months and eliminating all of the "oops" litters, the overbirthing could theoretically be eliminated in one or two years.  What a triumph that would be for all concerned.

Category: Spaying your Female Cat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Spaying your cat is an important part of basic cat health care. Spaying at a young age prevents mammary cancer, and spaying at any age prevents unwanted kittens, noisy heat cycles, and possibly even urine marking in the house. The following is a list of frequently asked questions gleaned from years of veterinary practice as well as from answering questions online. We have found that, even though a cat spay is a routine and commonly performed procedure, many pet owners still have questions. What is actually removed during spaying? Spaying is an ovariohysterectomy, which means that both the ovaries and the uterus are removed. The cervix is tied off, leaving the vagina to end in a blind sac. Since it is the ovaries that are responsible for the heat cycles, possible mammary tumor development, and behavior problems, it is crucial that the ovaries be removed intact. Some veterinarians will leave the uterus behind, though it is standard to remove the entire tract, uterus included. How long will my cat stay in the hospital? Some hospitals prefer to keep surgery cases overnight so that they can rest in a properly confined area; some veterinarians believe that this first night of confinement helps the incision in healing. Some hospitals and most spay clinics will release the cat on the same day as surgery so that she may be observed at home in case of problems. Either way is legitimate and largely depends on the preference and philosophy of the doctor in charge of setting policy. Will she have stitches? Some veterinarians always place an external closure of the skin in the form of either stitches or staples. Some veterinarians never place skin stitches and prefer to close the incision with buried stitches that are internal. The spay incision is closed in several layers (the abdominal muscles, the tissue under the skin, and the skin itself may all be closed separately). Skin stitches necessitate a return visit for a recheck, which is always a good idea after abdominal surgery. Obviously, it may be more convenient for the owner not to have to make a return trip, and it may be simpler not to have to worry about the cat pulling out her skin stitches and causing herself injury. Some hospitals employ both methods, though aggressive or feral cats almost always receive buried sutures so as to eliminate possible bite injury to the staff at suture removal.  What can I expect regarding the recovery period/incision care? One of the advantages of keeping cats overnight after spaying is that they usually go home bright and alert as if nothing has happened. Some cats will not eat for the first day or so, but if the cat does not seem back to normal by the day following discharge, your veterinarian would like to know about it. Cats discharged on the same day as surgery may experience more soreness if not confined to a small area. Food and water are generally withheld until the next day or late that night, and the cat should be kept quiet and not allowed outside. Cats should not be discharged while still groggy in any way from anesthesia as they are a danger to themselves and to their human handlers. Additional pain medication may be prescribed. Later in the recovery period, it is not unusual to notice swelling at the incision site. Cats often react this way to internal sutures, and this kind of swelling is common and resolves spontaneously. Such swellings are firm, and there is no fluid drainage or bleeding from the incision. They generally resolve in 3 to 4 weeks and represent a reaction to the internal stitches as they dissolve. That said, it is prudent for any incisional swelling to be checked out. If the cat has been overly active, she can break internal stitches, which could be a problem. Any fluid drainage from the incision is abnormal, and the cat should be rechecked by the veterinarian who performed the spay if possible. What if she is in heat at the time of spay? Some female cats are disruptively annoying when they are in heat, yowling and carrying on and they are spayed to end the heat quickly. Other cats are spayed in heat randomly when the owner does not realize that the cat is in heat. Either way the spay is slightly more difficult due to the engorgement of the tissues and larger blood vessels. Spaying during heat does not carry a significant risk to the cat, but since extra surgery time is frequently required, an extra charge may be incurred. Occasionally spaying a cat in heat leads to dramatic mammary gland development in the recovery period because the sudden drop in progesterone levels that accompanies removing the active ovaries mimics the drop in progesterone that accompanies giving birth to kittens. The subsequent mammary development (called mammary hyperplasia) can be spectacular but generally resolves without treatment as hormones normalize. What if she is pregnant at the time of spay? Spaying can be performed at any time during the course of pregnancy. Often, the owner is unaware that the cat is pregnant. If there is any question, make it clear to your veterinarian what your wishes are should your cat be found pregnant. The incision can be closed, and the pregnancy can proceed, or the spay can proceed, and the developing kittens will be removed along with the rest of the uterus. Due to extra work and surgery time, most veterinarians will charge an extra fee for spaying a pregnant animal. Some veterinarians will not knowingly spay a pregnant animal after a certain stage of pregnancy. At my hospital, I am commonly asked what to do about newly adopted stray cats thought to be pregnant. As we work with numerous rescue groups, we are keenly aware of the pet overpopulation problem. We encourage the spaying of strays or newly adopted female cats regardless of pregnancy. There are simply too many kittens without homes as it is. Will spaying affect her personality? The female cat spends at least half the year with her reproductive tract dormant (cats only cycle seasonally, primarily in the spring and summer). This means that behaviorally speaking, she acts spayed most of the time, and no personality change should be noted. This said it is important to realize that a cycling cat can be extremely solicitous of affection. This kind of playful, flirtatious behavior will stop with spaying. How long after having kittens can she be spayed? The mammary (breast) development that comes with nursing can make the spay surgery more difficult. Ideally, a month after weaning allows for regression of this tissue, and spaying can proceed. Unfortunately, it is possible for a female cat to become pregnant during this waiting period if her owner is not careful. At what age can my cat be spayed? The traditional age for spaying is six months; however, this practice has enabled kittens to be adopted from shelters unspayed. Often the new owner fails to return for spaying, and the result is a further contribution to the pet overpopulation problem. (Up to 70% of litters from owned cats are unplanned.) The last 20 years have brought us a great deal of research into and experience with early spaying, and there are many advantages of spaying well before the age six months. Young kittens recover more quickly from spaying than older kittens, and kittens spayed at young ages seem to have a reduced incidence of asthma later on.  Obviously, accidental pregnancy is not an issue when the kitten is adopted and already spayed. Spaying can be performed in kittens as early as eight weeks; however, my hospital finds such tiny tissues difficult to manipulate, and I like to wait to spay our female patients until they weigh at least three-and-one-half to four pounds. Will she get fat and lazy after spaying? Estrogens have a natural appetite-suppressing effect, and the loss of estrogens may lead to an increased appetite. Further, sterilization surgery has been shown to slow a cat's metabolism. Depending on the cat's age and activity level at the time of surgery, a diet change to a "light" diet may be in order. Ask your vet if you are not sure. Without ovaries, she should be unable to come into heat. That said, feline ovarian tissue has been documented extending down the ovarian ligament, well outside the actual ovary but not visible to the naked eye. This allows for ovarian tissue sometimes to be retained even when the ovary has been removed intact. Occasionally, a remnant of ovarian tissue is simply left behind by accident. This can lead to some annoying behaviors as the cat comes into heat (though she would be unable to get pregnant if her uterus had been removed, as is customary with spaying). Some testing or even surgical exploration may be needed to determine if there is anovarian remnant. Once again, spaying is an important part of cat ownership and one of the most significant steps in health care that a cat owner can provide for their female cat.

Category: Canned Food Transition for Cats Addicted to Dry Food
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (The information contained in this handout is an excerpt fromFeeding Your Cat: Know the Basics of Feline Nutrition,which can be found at the author's website,catinfo.org.) Cats, like children, often resist what is best for them. The two most frequent comments that I hear from people when trying to convince them to feed their cats a healthier diet are “my cat won’t eat canned food” and “but my cat reallylikeshis dry food.”  Children really like potato chips and ice cream, but that certainly does not mean those food items constitute optimal nutrition. The transition process often involves much more than just plunking down a new food item.  Time, patience and tricks are often required. One reason that cats like dry food so much is because the pet food companies do not play fair when manufacturing this sub-optimal food source.  They coat the kibble with extremely enticing animal digest sprays that are very pleasing to a cat – making a poor quality diet very desirable to the target animal. In addition to the aforementioned coating of dry food with animal digests, another issue is one of a crunchytexture,which is very different from canned food.  Cats are very resistant to such a drastic change in the texture of their food. If you are convinced that getting your cat off of dry food is the way to go, read on for some tips on how to accomplish this. The key is to do itslowly and with patienceand incorporate various tricks for the stubborn cats.The most important issue is actuallymaking the change, not how fast you accomplish it. I must say that my cats tested every ounce of patience I had over a 3+ month period of time during their transition from dry to canned food.  They had been on dry food their entire lives and did not recognize canned food as food.  My cats ranged in age from 2 years to 10 years at the time of the transition. The single biggest mistake I see people make time and again is to say that their cat “won’t touch” the new food and then panic and fill up the bowl with dry food.  In many cases, it is simply not that easy to get cats off of dry food. There are two categories of cats – those that will eat canned food and those that will beextremelyresistant to eating anything other than dry food.  If your cat falls into the first category, lucky you. These cats will take to it with the attitude of “finally – an appropriate diet for my species.” In this case, if your cat has been on all dry food, or only receives canned food as an occasional ‘treat,’ start by feeding canned food in increasing amounts.  Gradually decrease the dry, taking about a week to fully switch the cat over to 100 percent canned food. Some cats may experiencesofter stoolsduring the transition.  I do not worry if this happens and tend to ‘ride it out.’  If diarrhea results from the diet change you will either need to experiment with different canned foods or slow the transition down and do it over a period of several weeks. Note that in over 40 years spent in this profession, I have never met a cat that needed dry food to stay healthy but some need to be transitioned more slowly than others. The average cat should eat about 180 – 220 calories per day which will be found in5-6 ounces of the average canned food. However, note that high protein/low fat/low carb foods like Weruva Paw Lickin’ Chicken and some Tiki Cat varieties arevery low in calories(see theCat Food Compositionchart, far right column) so you will need to feed much more than 5-6 ounces which can get quite expensive. The necessary daily caloric intake should be split between 3 to 4 meals/day (or just free-fed if they are not overweight). When determining how much you should be feeding your cat once transitioned to canned food, keep it simple.Too fat?  Feed less.  Too thin?  Feed more. Now….for the stubborn cats…… If you are unlucky like I was, and your cat does not recognize the fact that he is a carnivore and would live a healthier life if eating canned food, (or a homemade diet) then you will have some work to do.  Some cats that have been on dry food for their entire life will be quite resistant to the diet change and may take several weeks or longer to make the transition to a healthier diet. For ‘resistant-to-change’ cats, you will need to use thenormal sensation of hungerto help with the transition. For this reason, it is very important tostop free-feeding dry food.This is the first, and very critical, step.  You need to establish set mealtimes.They are not going to try anything new if their bowl of junk food is in front of them 24/7. Cats do not need food available at all times. It really is okay for them to experience a hunger pain!  That said, it wasveryhard for me to listen to my cats begging for food even though I was strong in my conviction that I was heading them in the best direction for optimal health. It truly was a stressful time for me and them.  Actually, I think it was harder on me! This is where many people fail and just give in and fill up the dry food bowl.  There were a few times when I had to call my ‘sponsor’ and was instructed to “just leave the house if you can’t take looking into those eyes!”  I left the house. Those pitiful little cries of “I have not had food for two WHOLE hours!” were hard to take.  But, lo and behold, they were just fine when I returned.  Not one cat had died from hunger. On the other hand,donotattempt to withhold food for long periods of time(greater than 24 hours) with the hope that your cat will choose the new food.  You need to ‘convince’ them that a high quality canned food  really is good for them, rather than to try starving them into it – which does not work anyway.  Allowing a cat to go without food – especially an overweight cat – for a long period of time (greater than 48 hours) can be quite dangerous and may result inhepatic lipidosis(fatty liver disease). Hepatic lipidosis can also develop when a cat consumes 50 percent or less of his daily caloric requirements over a period of many days.  The definition of “many” varies from cat-to-cat.  For this reason it is important to understand that you need to have some idea of thecalories from canned foodcombined with the calories from dry food that your cat is consuming on a daily basis while you are implementing the transition to canned food. I have never seen a cat develop hepatic lipidosis when consuming at least 15 calories per pound per day. This number is figured onlean body weight, not fat weight. If your cat weighs 18 pounds but really should weigh 12 pounds, please make sure that he is consuming about 180 calories per day.  (12 pounds lean body mass X 15 calories/pound/day = about 180 calories/day) In reality, the cat in the above example would probably be completely safe at only 150 calories per day. If you have a small female cat that should only weigh 9 pounds, please make sure that she is consuming at least 135 calories per day. Canned foods never list the calorie content on the can but many dry foods do list this information on the bag.  Aroughguideline for the calorie content of most canned foods that are 78 percent moisture is about 30 calories per ounce, but can range from 20 to 40 calories/ounce as shown by the chart linked above. Most cats will lose some weight during the transition to canned food.  Given that a very high percentage of cats are overweight to begin with, this is a favorable result of the diet change –as long as they do not lose too much weight too fast.A cat should never lose more than one to two percent of body weight per week. I highly suggest that all cat caregivers weigh their cats periodically, especially if they are over 10 years of age.  This will help ensure a safe transition to a healthier diet and, in general, weight loss is often the first sign of ill health for any reason.  I make it a point to weigh my cats at least once each month, especially since they are now over 10 years of age. Here is a scale that is reasonably priced:Salter Baby and Toddler scale. It weighs to the nearest half ounce and has a ‘hold’ button on it that helps obtain an accurate weight even for a cat that is moving around a bit. Here is another scale that may be even better because its base is as long as the scale.Red Cross Baby Scale. This is important for cats that are trained to walk onto it otherwise, scales like the Salter one linked above may tip.  This would scare the cat and harm the scale. All of my cats lost weight during the three months that it took to switch them to canned but none of them became too thin. They slimmed down to a nice lean body weight – losing fat while maintaining their muscle mass.  They also became much more active. If your cat is overweight, please see thefeline obesityarticle. Resign yourself to the fact that youwillbe very frustrated at times and youwillbe wasting canned food as they turn up their nose at it.  Also, you may want to immediately switch your cat to a dry food that has fewer calories from carbohydrates than most dry foods. Talk to your veterinarian about specific brands. The low-carb dry foods are very high in fat and therefore are very calorie dense.  These foods must beportion-controlled,otherwise your cat may end up gaining weight.  Let's presume that a certain dry food has 612 calories per cup.  One quarter of a cup contains 153 calories so be very careful to pay attention to how much of these high calorie dry foods you feed. The caloric needs of an average cat can range between 150 to 250 calories/day depending on their lean body weight and activity level. The low-carb dry foods are also very high in phosphorus.  This is especially detrimental for cats with compromised kidney function. And, of course, these low-carb dry foods arewater-depleted– just like all dry foods – putting your cat at risk for serious urinary tract problems.  They are also cooked at high temperatures in order to dry them out. I do not recommend these dry foods for long-term feeding for all of the reasons stated above. Please use them only as transition diets. Be sure to stay away from any “light” varieties since those types of foods are very high in carbohydrates. Here are some various tricks for the stubborn ones. Keep in mind that different tricks work on different cats: These are just a few tricks that you can try.  Different tricks work on different cats.  The key is to be patient.Remember, it took me three months to get my cats on 100 percent canned food.Most cats, however, will not take this long.

Category: Nutrition for Your Cat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  Unlike dogs and people, which are omnivores and gain nutrition from both plants and meat, cats are obligate carnivores. This means that they get most of their nutrients from animal products. One scientific study showed that when cats in the wild live on prey (such as mice, that they hunt and kill), their diet is primarily protein (55%), some fat (45%), and only a very small percentage of carbohydrates (1-2%). These are specific numbers from just one study, and that study didn’t follow all those cats around and look at the long-term health impacts of diet or compare a wild, scavenging cat’s environment to that of an inactive indoor cat. However, this and similar studies show that a cat’s diet should probably consist of high amounts of protein, moderate amounts of fat, and low amounts of carbohydrates. One of the likely reasons behind these nutritional percentages is that a cat’s diet is based on the methods by which their body breaks down and metabolizes foods.   Are Carbohydrates Bad for Cats? Depending on a cat’s life stage, the type of carbohydrate, and how it is manufactured, cats can digest an appropriateamountof carbohydrates efficiently. Small amounts of carbohydrates are necessary for their diets (e.g., fiber aids digestion and colonic health). All Proteins Are Not Equal Fish-based diets can sometimes have an imbalance of phosphorus and magnesium, which are important nutrients for cats. Feeding a diet made almost entirely of canned tuna can cause vitamin E deficiency.Yourcat’s diet needs to consist of more thanjustchoice cuts of meat;organ meats and fat are also important. The key is balance and ensuring nutritional needs are met. Additional Nutritional Needs of a Cat In addition to your cat’s protein requirements, they are deficient and/or can’t make certain nutrients needed for survival. Instead, they must get these nutrients from the foods they eat. Important dietary nutrients include amino acids, which are molecules that form proteins, as well as vitamins such as vitamin B (niacin) and vitamin D. Many of these important nutrients are primarily obtained from animal products (e.g., liver, protein, fat), which further highlights the importance of a diet high in animal protein. When researching commercial cat foods,make surethese nutrients are part of the ingredients. If you are unsure if your cat’s current diethasthese nutrients, ask your veterinarian. Water The domestic house cat is believed to have descended from wild desert cats. They can survive on less water than some other animals, such as dogs. This is great for survival but can be a problem in the long term because they have less of a drive to seek water when their bodies need it. This lack of water can lead to a variety of issues over time. This information leads many researchers to recommend canned food because of its higher water content (70%-80% water) over dry food (10%-12% water). Other ways tomake sureyour cat gets enough water include offering more options for drinking, such as multiple water bowls throughout the house, a kitty water fountain, or occasionally letting a faucet drip totemptthem to drink.   Canned Food vs Dry Kibble Evidence suggests that canned commercial diets (wet food) high in protein and low in carbohydrates may be the best diet for many cats; however, more research is needed. Some veterinarians have also noticed that common issues in feline medicine, such as urinary tract disease and chronic gastrointestinal (GI) issues, areseenmuch moreoftenin catsthat arefed dry diets alone.Hopefully, more veterinary studies in this area will be conducted to shed further light on these findings. Another benefit of canned food over dry is that the water content helpskeepthe sensation of feeling full, so your cat won’t consume too many calories. Many veterinarians will switch an overweight cat that has been eating dry food to a canned food diet as the first step toward weight loss, but the diet should also be appropriately fortified tomake sureessential nutrients are in the right concentrations. It is important to note that canned diets tend to be more expensive than dry kibble diets, and there is often more food waste. Canned diets may not be for every family. Raw Diets Raw diets aren’t ideal for any pet, even for the carnivorous cat. It is difficult to properly make a raw dietthat includesnecessary nutrients, vitamins, amino acids, proteins, fats, and carbohydratesandiscorrectly balanced. Raw meat can also contain bacteria and parasites that can make not only your cat sick but you as well. Outdoor and feral cats that eat only prey animals may have a slightly decreased risk of this issue because the kill is fresh, but they can still catch diseases such astoxoplasmosisfrom eating raw prey. When to Feed Many feline species found in the wild tend to be grazers, eating multiple small meals throughout the day and night. This tendency is thought to be associated with the types of prey they hunt. Domestic cats are the same, even if they eat commercial cat food. Leaving an appropriate amount of dry food out all day or using a timed feeder so that cats can eat as they need to works pretty well for most cats as long as they do not overeat. If using canned food, or if your cat is on a calorie-restricted diet, you can offer smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day to help keep them on their body’s natural schedule. Making a Change to Feeding Schedules Whether you are transitioning from freely fed kibble to periodically feeding canned food throughout the day, trying to get your cat on a schedule to better manage its calorie intake, trying to change from feeding one to two times a day to allowing more grazing, or just trying to readjust your sleeping schedule, the key isgradual change. Cats are absolutely creatures of habit. Just about every cat owner out there will tell you that when Daylight Savings Time hits, their cats’ tummies do not “spring forward” with the new time.Whatdo you do? Tips for Starting a New Feeding Schedule: • For slight changes in feeding times (like transitioning to Daylight Savings Time or a new starting time at work), adjust the new feeding time by 15-minute increments over one to two weeks.• To change to free feeding, decrease your cat's regular meals by one-fourth the amount and then offer the extra in the form of a snack in the morning and a snack in the afternoon. Gradually transition to four equal small meals a day, then try six small meals a day. This can be difficult (or may not be appropriate) for cats that are not naturally grazers and have a tendency to overeat.• To change from free feeding to set meals, start by reversing the above transition to regular meals. Offer six portions spaced out throughout the day instead of free-feeding, then gradually decrease the number of meals to two meals a day, increasing the portions as you go along to make sure your cat is getting the appropriate amount of daily calories.• To change to regularly scheduled wet food meals from freely fed dry kibble, start by transitioning to a regular schedule using their normal dry food diet. Once they are comfortable with their new feeding schedule, gradually mix in wet food with these regular meals (making sure to decrease the amount of dry food in proportion to the amount of wet food to avoid overfeeding your cat). With time, decrease the amount of kibble compared to wet food until you have them completely transitioned.• Be patient and transition as slowly as you can. If your cat quits eating or drives you crazy because their schedule has changed, go back a few steps in the transition process and start again. Some cats are very stubborn and are not up for big changes. If this is the case with your cat, a compromise of snacks throughout the day or a mix of dry and wet food may be the best you can do.• If in doubt, ask your veterinarian for more recommendations. You definitely won’t be the first cat owner to have a cat who only wants to eat one thing and only wants to eat it on their chosen schedule. Cats are very intelligent, independent animals, which is part of what makes them so great, but that also means it is pretty common for them to want things done their own way. How Much to Feed How much to feed depends on what you are feeding. Many commercial cat foods have a list  describing the recommended amount per weight on the can or bag. However, these recommendations are only general guidelines from the manufacturer. Feed the amount your cat needs for a healthy weight (which should be determined by your veterinarian), not what the cat currently weighs. For example, if your cat weighs 17 pounds but should weigh 12 pounds, slowly adjust the amount of food appropriate for a 12-pound cat. If your cat needs to lose weight, discuss your concerns with your veterinarian before starting a diet/calorie restriction plan since a specific diet is usually needed to do this safely. Being overweight is a significant health problem and should be prevented whenever possible or reversed if needed. It is also important to measure food correctly. Use a gram scale or measure food by volume with measuring cups rather than estimating the amount. Feeding just 10 extra pieces of dry kibble a day can contribute to 10% weight gain in a year, equivalent to an entire pound of body weight in most cats! Keep in mind that feeding a suitable amount of food will not stop your cat’s urge to hunt. In the wild, hunting often requires many attempts before success, so the instinct to hunt tends to be separate from a feeling of fullness. Cats get enrichment from hunting (i.e., enhanced quality of life from doing and acting on important cat behaviors), even if they don’t eat what they catch. You can help provide your cat with this type of enrichment by letting them play with mice or feathered toys to help stimulate their hunting instincts without affecting their waistlines. Determining Quality Always discuss your cat’s nutrition concerns with your veterinarian. Veterinarians are trained in nutrition and understand the delicate balance of nutrients needed to keep your cat healthy. Your veterinarian can make food recommendations based on your pet’s personal physical examination and health status. Help ensure your cat is eating an appropriate commercial diet for their life stage by making sure the food meets the nutritional standards of theAssociation of American Feed Control Officials(AAFCO), either by formulation or by using feeding tests. AAFCO publishes guidelines yearly to help keep the nutritional appropriateness of pet foods; in many cases, these recommendations are then adopted at the state level to become law. The monitoring and enforcement of pet food law is under the jurisdiction of state and federal officials, but the manufacturers bear a lot of responsibility to ensure nutritional adequacy. Unfortunately, pet foods have no certification or approval process; however, a large, reputable manufacturer following AAFCO guidelines and many other production standards helps ensure quality and safety. Avoiding a Picky Eater Cats tend to develop a liking for certain textures, flavors, smells, and temperatures of food. Preferences are fine, but extreme pickiness can make changing diets or getting a sick cat to eat difficult. Consider offering your cat a variety of food options in early life to help them avoid becoming stuck on certain foods. Tips for helping a picky eater transition to new foods include: • Maintaining a safe space for your cat’s meals (e.g., low noise, no concern with other pets trying to eat the food or bother your cat while eating).• Make sure a picky appetite is not poor because of illness (e.g., nausea from stomach upset, pain from arthritis).• Consider warming wet food to enhance smell and taste, but make sure it’s not too hot.• Mixing the food your cat is used to with the new food and transition slowly over several days or weeks.• Cats often refuse new diets when stressed but will eat them under normal conditions, so make sure the atmosphere is stress-free during the transition. Medical Management Through Food Veterinary therapeutic diets have been formulated to address medical problems in cats. Medical disorders that can be helped with specific diets include kidney disease, dental disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, urinary tract disorders, GI diseases, and pancreatitis. If your cat is experiencing a medical illness, especially one that is chronic or ongoing, talk to your veterinarian about whether a veterinary therapeutic diet might be helpful. Using Food Behaviors to Enhance Daily Life In addition to meeting nutritional and caloric needs, food can provide enrichment for cats, especially indoor cats, by stimulating their predatory impulses. This helps them live a happier, less stressful, and more cat-like life. Examples of enrichment through food are hiding meals in food puzzles and letting cats play with food-containing toys in a way that stimulates a cat’s natural predatory instinct of hunting for food. Remember that if a cat is on a restricted diet, you can use toys that stimulate the cat’s predator response, such as small, mouse-sized toys that squeak or make high-pitched noises. Toys that move unpredictably are especially fun for cats. This type of feeding or playing can help increase your cat’s activity level, decrease their stress, and may help keep them more physically fit. Common Myths About Food While many misconceptions exist about cats and food, a few common ones are listed below. You already know the truth about the most important one: cats are not omnivores but, in fact, are carnivores. Bottom Line:  Feed Balanced Diets Appropriate for Your Cat’s Life Stage, and Avoid Overfeeding Cats are not like people or dogs. They are carnivores and are adapted to eat a diet with specific nutrients. Your cat’s overall health can be significantly improved if obesity is avoided, and their lives are made more interesting with enrichment activities involving food. Canned foods can help keep good hydration and satiety (i.e., a feeling of fullness after eating). Talk to your veterinarian about which diet is best for your pet and how much to feed.

Category: Omega Three Fatty Acids for our Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Did you know that skin diseases account for as much as 25% of the cases seen by small animal veterinarians? Skin problems typically faced by pets and their owners include: The nutritional aspect of skin disease is quite broad. There are true nutritional deficiencies that affect the skin and other skin diseases that can be made dramatically better by using supplements.Just because a condition responds to a nutrient does not necessarily mean that there is a deficiency of it.Everyone wants their pet to have a lustrous beautiful coat and would like to do what it nutritionally possible to ensure this. Recently essential fatty acids have received a great deal of press. A brief primer follows. What is a Fatty Acid? Biochemically, a fatty acid is what we just call fat. When we talk about different types of fatty acids, we are talking about different types of fat. A fatty acid consists of a long carbon chain (say 20 or so carbons in length) with biochemical acids called a carboxyl group at one end and a methyl group on the other end. Saturated Vs. Unsaturated Each carbon has four binding sites. In the carbon chain, two sites will be taken up by other carbons (i.e., the two adjacent carbons on the chain). In a saturated fat, the other two sites are taken up by hydrogen atoms. Saturated fats are typically solid at room temperature, like lard and butter, and are usually made from animals. Saturated fats are generally burned as fuel by our bodies. An example of a saturated fatty acid is depicted in the above illustration. Unsaturated fats have two adjacent carbons held together by a biochemical double bond. These fats are generally liquid at room temperature and come from plants, such as olive oil, corn oil, etc. Unsaturated fats can be classified as omega three fatty acids or omega six fatty acids, depending on the location of the double bond relative to the methyl group at the end of the chain. These types of fatty acids are essential, meaning that our bodies cannot make them; instead, we must eat them in our diet. These fats are not burned for fuel but are used as structural components. The omega six fatty acids are used as the main structural components in our cells. Omega three acids are used in the retina and central nervous system. For healthy skin and coat, the diet must contain adequate omega six fatty acids as these make up the surface of the skin.Examples of omega six fatty acids (also called n-6 fatty acids): Linoleic acid, gamma linolenic acid, and Arachidonic acid. Evening Primrose oil is an excellent example.Examples of omega three fatty acids, also called n-3 fatty acids, include: Alpha linolenic acid (ALA), Eicosatetraenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).Cold water fish oils are an excellent source of DHA and EPA. A terrific source of ALA would be flax seed oil. DHA has anti-inflammatory properties, which is why it is so frequently recommended in inflammatory conditions. Many people prefer to use flax seed oil as their omega 3 source because flax seed oil does not taste fishy and people readily convert ALA to DHA. This is great for people but it turns out that pets are only able to convert about 10% of ALA to DHA, so for them cold water fish oils are better. Fortunately, most dogs and cats like the fishy taste. Should we Supplement Essential Fatty Acids?There is no question that a diet must contain adequate omega 6 fatty acids to maintain optimal skin and coat quality. A diet found to be “complete and balanced” will have an amount of omega 6 fatty acids that should be optimal for a normal animal. But there’s more. Omega 6 Fatty Acids and DandruffResearch has shown that dogs with oily, dandruffy skin (seborrhea) have insufficient omega 6 fatty acids in their skin despite eating a diet that should be optimal. When omega 6 fatty acids are supplemented, the seborrhea improves. This finding supports the old-time remedy of adding a spoonful of corn oil to the diet to ensure a glossy coat. Seborrhea is a complex condition but animals with it may need more omega 6 fatty acids. Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Omega 3 Fatty AcidsOmega 6 fatty acids constitute our cell membranes. During some biochemical situations, it is necessary to produce hormone-like substances called prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These substances are made from omega 6 fatty acids and the resulting prostaglandins and leukotrienes are not necessarily good for us. In fact, these substances are responsible for itching and inflammation leading to the clinical skin problems listed above. One way to address this is to supplement omega 3 fatty acids, which become incorporated into cell membranes along with the omega 6s. After a couple of months of supplementation, omega 3 fatty acids infiltrate cell membranes significantly. When it comes time to make prostaglandins, the omega 3s are mobilized instead of the omega 6s only in this case, the prostaglandins that result are not inflammatory. When omega 3 fatty acids are supplemented, itching can be substantially reduced and even arthritis pain improved. One problem with this is that no one really knows how much omega 3 fatty acid to supplement. There is some evidence that a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids in the supplement is crucial. If this is so, clinical research becomes hugely complicated as the diets of pets cannot be standardized easily for study. If pets in a study eat different diets, then it is impossible to tell what overall omega 6:omega 3 ratio each is receiving. Essential fatty acids are being pursued as treatment for diseases of virtually every organ system; watch for new research in this area. Conditions that Have Been Shown to Benefit from Omega 3 Fatty Acid Supplementation Research is ongoing. We know that supplementing with omega 3 appears to be benign with the potential to do a great deal of good.

To Be Avoided AlcoholAlcoholic beverages and food products containing alcohol can cause vomiting, diarrhea, decreased coordination, central nervous system depression, difficulty breathing, tremors, abnormal blood acidity, coma and even death. Under no circumstances should your pet be given any alcohol. If you suspect that your pet has ingested alcohol, contact your veterinarian or theASPCA Animal Poison Control Centerimmediately. AvocadoAvocado is primarily a problem for birds, rabbits, donkeys, horses, and ruminants, including sheep and goats. The biggest concern is cardiovascular damage and death in birds.  Horses, donkeys, and ruminants frequently get swollen, edematous head and neck. Chocolate, Coffee and CaffeineThese products all contain substances called methylxanthines, which are found in cacao seeds, the fruit of the plant used to make coffee, and in the nuts of an extract used in some sodas. When ingested by pets, methylxanthines can cause vomiting and diarrhea, panting, excessive thirst and urination, hyperactivity, abnormal heart rhythm, tremors, seizures, and even death. Note that darker chocolate is more dangerous than milk chocolate. White chocolate has the lowest level of methylxanthines, while baking chocolate contains the highest. CitrusThe stems, leaves, peels, fruit, and seeds of citrus plants contain varying amounts of citric acid, essential oils that can cause irritation and possibly even central nervous system depression if ingested in significant amounts. Small doses, such as eating the fruit, are not likely to present problems beyond minor stomach upset. Coconut and Coconut OilWhen ingested in small amounts, coconut, and coconut-based products are not likely to cause serious harm to your pet. The flesh and milk of fresh coconuts do contain oils that may cause stomach upset, loose stools or diarrhea. Because of this, we encourage you to use caution when offering your pets these foods. Coconut water is high in potassium and should not be given to your pet. Grapes and RaisinsAlthough the specific toxic substances within grapes and raisins are only suspected, these fruits can cause kidney failure in some pets. Until more information is known about the toxic substances, it is best to avoid feeding grapes and raisins to cats and dogs. Macadamia NutsMacadamia nuts can cause weakness, depression, vomiting, tremors, and hyperthermia in dogs. Signs usually appear within 12 hours of ingestion and can last approximately 12 to 48 hours. Milk and DairyBecause pets do not possess significant amounts of lactase (the enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk), milk and other dairy-based products cause them diarrhea or other digestive upset. NutsNuts, including almonds, pecans, and walnuts, contain high amounts of oils and fats. The fats can cause vomiting and diarrhea, and potentially pancreatitis in pets. Onions, Garlic, ChivesThese vegetables and herbs can cause gastrointestinal irritation and could lead to red blood cell damage. Although cats are more susceptible, dogs are also at risk if a large enough amount is consumed. Toxicity is normally diagnosed through history, clinical signs, and microscopic confirmation of Heinz bodies. Raw/Undercooked Meat, Eggs and BonesRaw meat and raw eggs can contain bacteria such as Salmonella and E. coli that can be harmful to pets and humans. Raw eggs contain an enzyme called avidin that decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin), which can lead to skin and coat problems. Feeding your pet raw bones may seem like a natural and healthy option that might occur if your pet lived in the wild. However, this can be very dangerous for a domestic pet, who might choke on bones or sustain a grave injury should the bone splinter and become lodged in or puncture your pet’s digestive tract. Salt and Salty Snack FoodsLarge amounts ofsaltcan produce excessive thirst and urination or even sodium ion poisoning in pets. Signs that your pet may have eaten too many salty foods include vomiting, diarrhea, depression, tremors, elevated body temperature, seizures, and even death. As such, we encourage you to avoid feeding salt-heavy snacks like potato chips, pretzels, and salted popcorn to your pets. XylitolXylitol is used as a sweetener in many products, including gum, candy, baked goods, and toothpaste. It can cause insulin release in most species, which can lead to liver failure. The increase in insulin leads to hypoglycemia (lowered sugar levels). Initial signs of toxicosis include vomiting, lethargy, and loss of coordination. Signs can progress to seizures. Elevated liver enzymes and liver failure can be seen within a few days. Yeast DoughYeast dough can rise and cause gas to accumulate in your pet’s digestive system. This can be painful and can cause the stomach to bloat and potentially twist, becoming a life-threatening emergency. The yeast produces ethanol as a by-product, and a dog ingesting raw bread dough can become drunk (see alcohol). The ASPCANational Animal Poison Controlis available 24 hours a day at 888-426-4435. Expect an initial consultation fee of around $100.00 and additional follow-up is at no charge. You will be assigned a case number your veterinarian can use to communicate with a toxicology specialist before beginning treatment. If your pet has aHomeAgainmicrochip, a free poison control consultation is included in the full-service registration.

Category: Cats and High Places: Keeping Them off Counters and Tables
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Last week, I had an inquiry from a recent shelter cat adopter. This new adopter wanted to know how she could keep her new cat, Chowder, off countertops and the table. It seems whenever they prepare food or eat, Chowder is right there waiting for his fair share. Since this behavior started, they have tried several methods to deter him from jumping up, including yelling at him, placing him back on the floor, and recently started using a squirt bottle to keep him off. None of their techniques are working and they are quickly becoming frustrated. Why do cats often find counters and tables so appealing? What does not help? Using water bottles to spray your cat, yelling “no”, and placing them back on the floor will probably not change this behavior. In some cases, it might make the behavior more persistent. Some cats may become anxious, because from their perspective, your behavior is suddenly unpredictable and alarming. Often, the only thing these cats are learning from these strategies is to stay away from the “punisher”, who in this case is you! What can be done to reduce this behavior? Step 1: Determine why your cat is getting on the counter in the first place. Are they trying to get away from something in the home? Another cat? The dogs? A person? Are they window watching for birds, other cats, or just outside activity in general? Are they sunbathing? Only sitting on the counter when the sun is there? Are they searching for delicious tidbits of food? Do they like to drink or play with the water in the sink? Are there interesting “toys” left on the counter such as forks, spoons, lids, paper, hair ties, pencils, sponges, etc.? Once the “why” is determined, prevention and management can be put into place. Step 2: Avoid Reinforcing or encouraging the behavior. Make sure food is never left on the counter or table at any time, not even a morsel. Any little crumb will reinforce the behavior making the behavior harder to change. It is also important that you do not leave water in the sink or the water running so your cat is not encouraged to investigate the sink. Keeping your counters clean and tidy can be very difficult, especially if you live in a very small place or you have other family members that might not be as tidy as you would like. However, making sure the other “toys” are unavailable will prevent your cat from looking in these spaces for things to play with. You can also make the counters less appealing for your cat. Closing the curtains or blinds in the kitchen window will remove the lure of the sun for those sunbathers, encouraging them to seek the other locations. In general, cats are not a fan of citrus and various other strong-smelling disinfectants. Cleaning your countertop and table with a citrus cleaner can reduce the appeal for some cats. Make sure the counter is dry immediately after wiping so there are no opportunities for your cat to ingest these cleaners or get them on their feet or fur. Placing a carpet runner upside down on your countertop or table creates an unpleasant texture that cats will try to avoid. Step 3: Provide alternative places for your cat to use. If your cat is trying to get away from something in the house, provide other safe places for your cat. Cat trees, shelving, chairs, or even another table nearby with a box and cat bed in it can create a safe place for your cat to retreat. If your cat is a window watcher or sunbather creating a perch in another window is a simple solution. Cats that are trying to escape to higher ground might need help learning that the cat tree, boxes, or shelving is safe. Be sure to place treats in the new location so your cat explores the alternative places on their own. In addition, when the thing they are trying to avoid is approaching them call them to the new location, and give them treats. Placing a bird feeder outside the window where the perch or cat tree is located is a sure way to keep your cat entertained. Using perches in several windows will allow the sunbathers to move from window to window. If your cat likes to get on the counters when you are preparing food and eating, give them something else to do like a food dispensing or puzzle toy. The website Food Puzzles for Cats is an excellent resource to find the perfect toys for your cat. Place treats in the locations you want your cat to go, such as the other window perches, on the cat tree, in the box on the chair, so they are rewarded for searching the new spots but there are no rewards for your cat on the kitchen counter or table. Make sure your cat has a variety of toys similar to the ones that attract them to the countertops to play. Scatter the toys on the floor near the counters or tables. If you consistently keep the counter and table clean and provide toys on the floor, your cat will learn that the counters are no longer worth investigating because all of the fun stuff is on the floor. If your cat is drawn to running water to drink or play in, consider using a cat water fountain. Step 4: Train your cat. Yes, cats can be trained. Use positive reinforcement to teach your cat behaviors such as coming when called, targeting or touch, fetch, and go to a place or mat, which is also called stationing. These simple behaviors not only help to improve the bond you have with your cat but provide clear communication and an opportunity to reward them for the behaviors you want them to do more often.

Category: Ticks Are Arthropod Parasites for Mammals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Ticks are skin parasites that feed on the blood of their hosts. Ticks like motion, warm temperatures from body heat, and the carbon dioxide exhaled by mammals, so they are attracted to such hosts as dogs, cats, rodents, rabbits, cattle, small mammals, etc. The bite itself is not usually painful, but the parasite can transmit diseases and causetick paralysis, which is why tick control is so important. (Removing the ticks leads to rapid improvement of the paralysis.) The minimal amount of time it takes for an attached tick to transmit disease is not known. The time it takes to transmit diseases is affected by the type of disease organism, the species of tick, etc. However, in general, if a tick is removed within 16 hours, the risk of disease transmission is considered to be very low. Therefore, owners can usually prevent disease transmission to their pets by following a regular schedule to look for and remove ticks. The Tick Life Cycle Most types of ticks require three hosts during a 2-3 year lifespan.  Each tick stage requires a blood meal before it can reach the next stage. Hard ticks have four life stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Larvae and nymphs must feed before they detach and molt. Adult female ticks can engorge, increasing their weight by more than 100-fold. After detaching, an adult female tick can lay approximately 3,000 eggs. During the egg-laying stage, ticks lay eggs in secluded areas with dense vegetation. The eggs hatch within two weeks. Some species of ticks lay 100 eggs at a time, while others lay 3,000 to 6,000 per batch. Once the eggs hatch, the ticks are in the larval stage, during which time the larvae move into the grass and search for their first blood meal. At this stage, they will attach themselves for several days to their first host, usually a bird or rodent, and then fall onto the ground. The nymph stage begins after the first blood meal is completed. Nymphs remain inactive during winter and start moving again in spring. Nymphs find a host, usually a rodent, pet, or human. Nymphs are generally about the size of a freckle. After this blood meal, ticks fall off the host and move into the adult stage. Throughout the autumn, male and female adults find a host, which is again usually a rodent, pet, or human. The adult female feeds for 8 to 12 days. The female mates while still attached to her host. Both ticks fall off, and the males die. The female remains inactive through the winter and in the spring lays her eggs in a secluded place. If adults cannot find a host animal in the fall, they can survive in leaf litter until the spring. What are the best ways to deal with these blood-sucking parasites? Outdoor Environmental Control Treating the yard and outdoor kennel area with acaricides (tick pesticides) is an important tool in the arsenal against ticks. Some products can be used to spray the outdoor area. However, you should not rely on spraying to reduce your risk of infection. If you have health concerns about applying acaricides, check with local health or agricultural officials about the best time toapply acaricides in your area, identify rules and regulations related to pesticide application on residential properties, and consider using a professional pesticide company to apply pesticides at your home. You can also create a tick-safe zone in your yard by using some simple landscaping techniques that can help reduce tick populations: Indoor Environmental ControlIf ticks are indoors, flea and tick foggers, sprays, or powders can be used. Inside, ticks typically crawl (they don't jump) and may be in cracks around windows and doors. A one-foot barrier of insecticide, where the carpeting and wall meet, can help with tick control. Preventing Ticks from Attaching If your pet goes outside regularly, you can use some type of residual insecticide on your pet. Talk to your veterinarian about what works best in your geographic area. If you use a liquid spray treatment, cats and skittish dogs typically prefer a pump bottle because of the noise from aerosol cans. Doubling the amount of anti-tick product, or using two at once, may cause toxicity problems.Any spray insecticide labeled for use on clothing should not be sprayed directly on pets. Powders are fairly easy to apply, but they can be messy. (Avoid topical powders if your pet has a respiratory condition.) Shampoos are useful only for ticks that are already on your pet. A tick collar might be somewhat more water-resistant than a residual insecticide, so if your dog likes to swim, the collar might be a better choice. Flea combs can be used to help remove ticks and wash your pet's bedding frequently. Finding and Removing Ticks The best way to find ticks on your pet is to run your hands over the whole body. Check for ticks every time your pet comes back from an area you know is inhabited by ticks. Ticks attach most frequently around the pet's head, ears, neck, and feet, but they are not restricted to those areas. There are several tick removal devices on the market, but a plain set of fine-tipped tweezers will remove a tick quite effectively. How To Remove A Tick With Tweezers Risk of disease transmission to you, while removing ticks, is low but you should wear gloves if you wish to be perfectly safe. Do not apply hot matches, petroleum jelly, turpentine, nail polish, or just rubbing alcohol alone. These methods do not remove the ticks and they are not safe for your pet. Rubbing alcohol could be used to disinfect the area before or after removing the tick. Watch for Infection and Diseases After you pull a tick off, there will be a local area of inflammation that could look red, crusty, or scabby. The tick’s attachment causes irritation. The site can get infected; if the pet is scratching at it, it is more apt to get infected. A mild topical antibiotic, such as over-the-counter triple antibiotic ointment, can help but usually is not necessary. The inflammation should go down within a week. If it stays crusty and inflamed longer than a week, it might have become infected. Various diseases can be transmitted by ticks includinganaplasmosis,babesiosis,ehrlichiosis,Lyme disease,tick paralysis(or tick toxicosis), and others. Not all species of animals (pets or not) are affected similarly by every tick-borne illness. Although ticks can transmit diseasescontracted from a previous hostto pets and humans, they are usually nothing more than a nuisance. The best approach is to prevent them from embedding and once embedded, to remove them quickly. If you notice your pet experiencing signs of illness or acting differently after a tick bite, it is always best to see your veterinarian. If you stay on top of the situation, your pets should cruise right through the tick season with no problems.

Category: Treating your Yard for Fleas and Ticks
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If fleas and ticks have been a problem for you, there are three areas you have to treat to be successful in treating fleas. One is treating your pets with an effective product; two is your house with a growth regulator; and the third is your yard. If you don’t have a fenced yard, it will be impossible to get total flea control because stray animals will be continually bringing in fleas and their eggs to your property and will expose your pets. However, you can spray around your house as far as is reasonable, and if you have a fenced yard, you can do a good job eliminating most fleas. When asked about yard treatment, many folks indicate that their yards are treated by a professional pest control company and most of those companies use a product called bifenthrin, which is in the pyrethroid family. Pyrethroids are manmade versions of pyrethrins, which come from chrysanthemum flowers. Bifenthrin works by interfering with the nervous system of insects when it is touched or eaten by the insect and is considered more toxic to insects than mammals due to their smaller size and lower body temperature. Due to factors such as sprinklers, mowing, and rain, lawn care companies may recommend multiple applications of the bifenthrin-containing product to be effective. In fact, I recommend to clients treating their own yard for fleas to treat once weekly for 4 weeks and then once a month to kill the young larval stages as they hatch because spraying will not kill the eggs. Tremors and seizures are listed as potential adverse effects of pyrethrin toxicosis (bifenthrin is a pyrethrin). Most of these products are safe for pets but the pets must be kept off the sprayed yard until it is dry. Pets exposed to bifenthrin can develop vomiting or diarrhea, twitching of the ears, paw flicking, increased drooling, hyperactivity, incoordination, diarrhea, depression, and dilated pupils. Seek veterinary care if some of these signs occur.

Category: Declawing and Alternatives for Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Declawing (also known as onychiectomy) has probably become the most controversial of all the elective surgical procedures commonly performed by veterinarians. While it is normal for cats to scratch things (to mark territory as well as to condition their claws) this behavior can destroy the bond between an owner and pet cat. Cats, especially adolescent cats, tend to play rough, scratching their owners or other pets sometimes violently in play. Claws serve to mark territory and assist in communicating territorial messages to other cats though this behavior can be undesirable when it is directed against furniture. The declaw surgery is an instant permanent solution to these problems; however, it is popularly held that a number of adverse conditions result from declawing, possibly including chronic pain for the cat. Pet owners need an understanding all of the alternative options involved as well as what the actual facts are regarding this procedure. The American Veterinary Medical Association policy regarding declawing is: The AVMA discourages the declawing (onychectomy) of cats as an elective procedure and supports non-surgical alternatives to the procedure. The AVMA respects the veterinarian’s right to use professional judgment when deciding how to best protect their individual patients’ health and welfare. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the veterinarian to counsel the owner about the natural scratching behavior of cats, the alternatives to surgery, as well as the details of the procedure itself and subsequent potential complications. Onychectomy is a surgical amputation and if performed, multi-modal perioperative pain management must be utilized.(1/1/2020 AVMA Policy Update)(editor's note: perioperative means around the time of surgery)   Alternatives to Declaw Surgery to Try First Scratching is a natural behavior of cats, which makes it difficult to modify. The usual goal is to transfer the cat's scratching instinct to a scratching post or other scratching toy; it is virtually impossible to control the desire to scratch completely. Some cats take quickly to alternative scratching surfaces while other cats require time-consuming training. Training tips include: Many owners are not excited about putting mousetraps up against their living room furniture, upholstering in aluminum foil, or decorating sofas and chairs with balloons. It is easy to see why a surgical solution would be attractive. Fortunately, there are more options. Nail Trimming For some cats, simply keeping the nails short is adequate control but many people do not know how to trim their cat's nails. In fact, the non-pigmented nail of a cat makes it easy to see where not to cut. Thisvideo on YouTubeshows exactly what to do. Blunt Acrylic Nail Caps This is another popular method of controlling a scratching problem. Blunt acrylic nail caps are glued onto the cat's claws. The idea is that the blunt nail will not be sharp enough to cause damage. The veterinary staff will place the first set but typically after that the owner has the option of placing the caps at home. What to Expect For additional resources on dealing with claws at home, visitwww.catfriendly.com/scratching. Surgical Declaw (Onychectomy) Despite our best efforts to deflect scratching or decrease claw sharpness, sometimes nothing works and an immediate, permanent solution is needed. It is important to consider that the declaw surgery alters the cat permanently and should not be done if alternative methods are effective. The cat will need some special care during the post-operative healing period: special litter, pain medication, and some activity restriction as he/she will have tender feet for a week or two after surgery. The declawed cat should be forever indoors or outdoors only with supervision as they will no longer have the ability to defend themselves against dogs or other cats. There is a great deal of controversy regarding this procedure and it has been legally restricted in many areas. Few veterinary surgeries encounter as much bias as the declaw, and a political has movement emerged. Some concerns are valid and some less so. Before making a decision, it is important to review the arguments and find your own perspective. Here are some of the issues.  Research has been conducted to sort out the truth from political propaganda. Here are some conclusions but feel free to examine the AVMA's information on your own. Myth #1:After declawing, a cat is likely to become fearful or experience behavior changes, impairing an affectionate relationship with his owner. Numerous scientific studies have been unable to document any behavior changes post-declaw. In fact, in one survey 70 percent of owners of declawed cats reported an improved relationship with their cat after the procedure. Myth #2:A declawed cat cannot climb trees. Declawed cats are not as effective at climbing trees as cats with claws, but declawing does not prevent tree climbing. That said, declawed cats should be kept indoors where they do not need claws to assist in self-defense. Myth #3:A declawed cat cannot catch prey. Declawed cats are not as effective at catching prey as cats with claws but declawing does not prevent effective hunting. Myth #4:A declawed cat has lost its ability to defend itself and should not be allowed outside. This one is true. Without claws, a cat has indeed lost an important part of its defense system. Declawed cats should be housed indoors only. Myth #5:Declawed cats are more likely to bite since they can no longer claw. Declawed cats do not seem to realize they have no claws. They will continue to scratch ineffectively as if they did not know the difference. As for biting, there have been some studies that show an increased tendency to bite in declawed cats while other studies have not shown that. The trouble in interpreting this information is that one of the reasons cats are declawed is to control aggression. Aggressive cats, even in play, are more likely to be declawed to at least remove the claw portion of the human hazard. The same cat is still perfectly able to bite and will continue to bite. Studies on cats that bite after declaw have not explored whether the same cats were biting before the declaw so conclusions are difficult to draw. Myth #6:The post-operative period involves tremendous pain. Pain management techniques have improved greatly in recent years and include regional nerve blocks eliminating pain completely from the feet during the first few days of healing, fentanyl pain relief patches, as well as injectable and oral medications. This means that a declawed cat should be comfortable in the recovery period. That said, if proper pain relief is not practiced, the declawed cat will have sore feet after surgery. The larger the cat, the more discomfort there is and reluctance to bear weight. The recovery period should not last longer than a week or so. Healing should be complete by two weeks. Pain after this recovery period is not normal or expected in any way and if a declawed cat seems to be uncomfortable or lame, a recheck appointment is definitely needed. If you plan to declaw your cat, you may want to ask your veterinarian about the pain relief plan they expect to utilize so you know what to expect. Myth #7:A declawed cat will not use a litter box again. It is important that litter not get impacted in the declaw incisions during the recovery period. Shredded paper is the usual recommendation during recovery and some cats simply will not use shredded paper. Recycled newspaper litters are an excellent alternative. The only litter problem one might expect would be a lack of acceptance of a new litter during the recovery period. Declawed cats do not lose their litter box instinct. Declaw Methods Three techniques are commonly used for permanent declaw surgery: the Resco or clipper blade method; the disarticulation method; and the Laser declaw. Resco/Clipper Blade Method This is probably the most common method used by veterinarians to declaw cats as it is associated with the fastest surgery time. It involves the use of a sterile nail trimmer to cut through the bone of the third digit of the toe. The cat loses the part of the bone from which the claw grows. The incision is either sewn closed with suture material or closed in surgical glue. What to Expect / Possible Complications Disarticulation MethodThis procedure is a bit more difficult to master as it involves the delicate disconnection of all the tiny ligaments holding the third bone in place. The entire third bone is removed intact, whereas, in the Resco method, the bone is cut through, leaving a small piece behind. What to Expect / Possible Complications The Laser Declaw: Another Way to DisarticulateRecently, the laser declaw has received a great deal of attention. In this surgery, a laser rather than a scalpel blade is used to disarticulate the third toe bone. Advantages of laser surgery include virtually no bleeding during surgery or afterward, possibly less post-operative pain, and in many cases, no bandages. The downside is the expense of the equipment. The cost of the laser equipment itself is $20,000 to $40,000. To justify such an expense, the laser must be able to generate substantial revenue for the hospital. This means that the cost of the laser declaw to the pet owner is likely to exceed the price of the conventional declaw. Tendonectomy: A Surgical Alternative to Declawing This surgical procedure has emerged as an alternative to the bone-removing declaws. Here, a tendon is cut on the underside of each toe to prevent grasping motions. The claws remain but the cat cannot extend them. What to Expect / Possible Complications The most important thing is making a well-informed decision with your veterinarian.

This tiny but sturdy little implant can reunite you with a lost pet, serve as proof of ownership in a dispute, or even mean the difference between euthanasia and medical care in an emergency. In many communities, it is not legal to own an unmicrochipped dog, and in many communities, shelters automatically microchip any pet that is released through its doors for adoption. Microchipping has been around for over 20 to 30 years, yet some pet owners still resist chipping. Questions commonly arise about how the chip is inserted, what information is contained on the chip, the difference between a registered chip and an unregistered one, what to do if a chipped pet is lost, and more. There are many misconceptions about chipping. For example: Don't forget to update your contact information with the chip registry when you move. What Information is Encoded on the Chip? Only the unique identification number is encoded on the chip. None of your personal information is on the chip. The chip number is similar to a Vehicle Identification Number on a car. It is registered in one of several central registries just as a car is registered and it is the central registry that has your personal information (name, address, phone number, alternate contact, pet description etc.). Each chip number is unique and no two chips have the same number. Let's clear up some confusion. Microchip Implantation: Basically a Shot With a Big Needle The microchip ID is small enough to pass through the bore of a large needle made for this purpose. Microchips are generally shipped in an individually packaged syringe made for chip implantation. Implantation is basically a shot, and if you like, it can be done in the examination room while you watch. The needle is fairly large, so sometimes there is a yipe but, more often than not, the reaction is minimal. Chips can be implanted in newborn animals to assist in telling them apart. Some people like to wait until the pet is being spayed or neutered so that the pet does not feel the large chip implantation needle. The downside of waiting, of course, is that pets may escape or get lost before they have their permanent ID. A common misconception is that chip implantation requires surgery. In fact, a chip can be implanted in a matter of seconds while you wait. Can a Microchip be Used to Locate a Lost Pet? No. A microchip is not a location device. At the present time, GPS collars are available, but their use is limited by the fact that a collar can be removed or can come off. A microchip is an identification device, not a locator. With All This Fancy Technology, Why Is an Old-Fashioned Identification Tag Included with the Chip? An ID tag is usually provided with the chip. The ID tag has the chip number and phone number for the registry. The tag is not for your keyring or to keep in a drawer; it is meant for your pet to wear as a backup. If a lost pet is found by a neighbor, stranger, or basically by anyone who does not have their own handy chip scanner, they will see the ID tag and know who to call. The registry will either contact you or they will provide the finder with information on how to contact you.  It is important to periodically check this tag over the years as the markings on the plastic tend to fade, and if they are illegible, they will not be helpful. You can order replacement tags from the chip company or have engraved metal tags made by any of a number of pet tag companies, but be sure to include the registry phone number on the tag if you do. What Happens If the Chip Does Not Get Registered? It is vitally important that you register your chip. Simply having a chip will not bring your pet home to you. Many rescue groups, pet stores, and shelters will implant chips and let you know your new pet is chipped, but leave the registration (which usually requires a fee) up to you. Many animal hospitals will chip your pet and then give you the mail-in registration form to complete the process at home.  Be very clear about this point when you get a new pet that comes with a chip. It is easy for the registration forms to get mixed up in receipts, vaccination records, and other paperwork. If a pet with an unregistered chip is found, it may still be possible to trace the owner. The manufacturer of the chip is usually identifiable from the chip number. The major microchip manufacturers keep records of the facilities to which they have sold their chips. In this way, the facility where the chip was implanted can be identified. If that facility has records, the owner may be identified and contacted. This process assumes the manufacturer keeps records (smaller companies do not), that the facility where the chip was implanted keeps records, and that the owner's phone number is the same. If there are no records, this all leads to a dead end. It is really important to keep your registration current. If your chip is not registered and someone finds your pet and wishes to keep him, they may simply register the chip in their own name. Often a chip is implanted, and the registration forms are given to you to fill out on your own.If you do not send in the forms, the chip will not be registered. Must the Chip’s Registration be Renewed Annually? For the major brands of microchips, the answer is no. Once the chip is registered, that registration is indefinite. This is a good thing in that the chip never becomes unregistered after it has been registered. The problem is that people move or the pet changes ownership and the chip information is never updated. Some chip registries have developed deluxe programs that do require annual renewal largely as a means to remind you to keep your information current. How Many Registries Are There? There are many chip registries, and a chip can be registered in any of them. The good news is that most chip distributors have their own registries, and it is easy to find a chip’s most likely registry based on its number. For example, AVID chips are generally in the AVID database, HomeAgain chips are generally in the HomeAgain database, etc. Because so many chip registries have emerged, it can get tricky to determine what registry to call when a found animal is located. The American Animal Hospital Association has developed PetMicrochipLookUp.org. This tool allows for a registered chip number to be connected to its registry. The registry can then be contacted for owner contact information. If the chip is not registered, then its manufacturer is identified, and it may be possible to trace the owner by tracing the chip to the facility where it was implanted, as described earlier. It is important to consider the importance of the chip's registry. It is vital that the registry be identifiable from the chip number, as this will be how your pet is returned to you. If the pet is chipped but it is not possible to tell what registry to contact, the chip is useless. If the chip company does not participate in PetMicrochipLookUp.org, it will be very hard to determine where to call. Further, you need the registry to be reachable 24 hours a day and you want a company that is stable enough that you can count on its being in business for the entire lifespan of your pet.  It is tempting to look for bargains in microchipping, but this seems to be an area where it is best to stick to major brands and use their associated registries. One would think there was one single registry for all chips, but there is not, and one would think customer service would be consistent among registries, but it is not. What Should Be Done for a Pet That Was Adopted With a Chip Registered to a Prior Owner? Each chip company has its own policy for this situation. Some will require a written note from the original owner allowing registration change. Some companies attempt to contact the original owner for a defined amount of time, and if the owner is not reached, then the chip may be re-registered. Contact the chip company that issued the chip for instructions in this situation. Is Licensing the Pet with the City Going to Register the Chip Automatically? Don't count on it. When a dog is adopted from a city shelter, it is common for the dog to be issued a license and for a microchip to be implanted and registered, but this depends on the city. The dog license registration will include information about the dog's rabies vaccination, ownership, and microchip number, if there is one, but that is not the same thing as registering the chip. If the pet is found and brought to the shelter, the chip will identify him in the shelter's records but if the pet is found and brought anywhere else, identifying the owner will depend on whether or not the chip is properly registered. What Should I Do If My Pet Is Lost? Notify the chip company so that the chip number will be flagged as belonging to a lost pet. If the company has a system beyond its chip registry, your pet's photo (assuming you have uploaded one) will be circulated to local animal hospitals and shelters. Be sure the chip company has your correct telephone number and contact information should your pet be found. Be sure to check the local animal shelter and inquire as to how to proceed there. Posters around the neighborhood also help. Hopefully, your pet is wearing some sort of identification as well (such as the tag that came with the chip) so that you can be contacted by the finder directly. What Do I Do if I Find a Pet? Running the pet to a local animal hospital or shelter will allow for rapid scanning for the presence of a microchip. If a chip is discovered and it is registered, it should not be difficult to find the owner. It is amazing how long some animals are lost before someone thinks to scan them. If you find a stray dog or cat, be sure to have it scanned sooner rather than later in case someone is out there searching. If there is no chip or identification tag, check the lost ads in the local newspaper listings. If there is no match-up, you may be legally compelled to bring the animal to the local animal shelter as this will be where the original owner is likely to look. Situations Where a Chip Can Mean Life or Death Lost Pet This is the obvious situation for which the chip ID was developed. If your lost pet is recovered by the local shelter or taken to an animal hospital as a lost pet, the pet is scanned, the number found, the registry contacted, and you will be notified. Burglary If your home is burglarized, you can bet the criminals involved will not be careful to leave your doors or gates closed when they leave. Your pet may wander away in this situation, and permanent identification may be needed to help your pet get home. Natural Disaster Earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides, hurricanes, etc. all lead to pets being separated from their homes. In some cases, Animal Control must evacuate pets from a community into a central holding area. Being able to prove a pet is yours is invaluable in this situation, especially if your pet is difficult to identify from a photo or does not have distinguishing markings. After Hurricane Katrina, a number of rescued animals were evacuated to holding areas, and their photos were posted on the Internet. Many pets were frightened, and good photographs could not be obtained. Injury If a pet is injured while lost or injured while roaming - as in the case of an outdoor cat hit by a car - a good Samaritan might bring the pet to an animal hospital for care. A stranger may not be willing to cover expenses for a pet they found on the road, and if your pet has no identification, you may never even know what happened. A microchip allows you to be notified so that proper decisions can be made. Don't forget to chip a pet before traveling with you.

Category: Nail Trims for Adult Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many cat owners never learned to trim their kitten’s nails and struggle with nail trims for their adult cat. To prevent scratches to people and furniture, as well as to decrease the potential of too long nails causing pain, difficulty walking, and other medical issues your cat’s nails will need to be trimmed from time to time. To make trimming your cat’s nails easy for you and acceptable for your cat will take time, patience, and rewards. There are several low stress handling methods that can be used to make it easier for you to trim nails, such as a towel wrap or allowing the cat to sit comfortably in a lap.  Distractions such as toys or food can also be helpful during trimming. Technique for Adult Cats It is not too late to begin training an adult cat to get their nails trimmed. You can still make this experience a positive one. Similar totraining a kitten, this process takes time, patience, and rewards. Nail trims should be done in the position that is best for your cat, whether they are sitting, standing, or lying down. Choose a location where your cat is most comfortable such as on your lap, or on their favorite perch. Your cat will not have the patience for all their nails to be trimmed during the first few training sessions, so start this process when they are not urgently needing a nail trim. Each training session should be kept to less than two minutes. Frequent, short training sessions are better than long sessions.

Category: Neutering your Male Cat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Neutering a male cat is an excellent step to help your young man grow into a loving, well-adapted household citizen. The main reason to neuter a male cat is to reduce the incidence of objectionable behaviors that are normal in the feline world but unacceptable in ours. A neutered male cat has had his testicles removed, not only ending his ability to reproduce but also removing his source of testosterone and his interest in hormone-driven behaviors. Roaming:More than 90 percent will reduce this behavior with neutering. Approximately 60 percent reduce this behavior right away. Fighting:More than 90 percent will reduce this behavior with neutering Approximately 60 percent reduce this behavior right away. Urine marking:More than 90 percent will reduce this behavior with neutering. Approximately 80 percent reduce this behavior right away. Other benefits of neutering include a drastic reduction in cat urine odor, reduced incidence of feline asthma, and of gingivitis (gum inflammation). The reduction in fighting and roaming helps an outdoor male cat reduce his risk of FIV infection, bite wounds and associated abscesses, automobile-related trauma, dog/coyote-related injury, and other outdoor lifestyle situations that result from traveling away from home. Cosmetic reasons to neuter a male cat has to do with the physical appearance. The mature tomcat is built for battle with a muscular body and facial thickenings (called shields) for protection against the bites of his combat opponents. Tomcats neutered after puberty will eventually lose these characteristics and male cats neutered beforepuberty never develop them. A common shelter practice has been to adopt out a young male kitten with his new owner paying a neuter deposit, which is then refunded when the kitten is neutered at the traditional age of six months. The problem has been that new owners do not return and young cats go unneutered. Given that studies have found that approximately 70 percent of feline litters are unplanned and there is presently an enormous feline overpopulation problem, the importance of neutering cannot be overemphasized. What is Early Neutering? Early neutering allows for kittens to be neutered prior to adoption thus preventing these kittens from contributing to the unplanned litter problem. There has been some controversy over this practice as it flies in the face of tradition and there have been questions about any negative health consequences of this practice. Some concerns that have been explored have included: Behavioral problems with regard to shyness or socialization issues in kittens neutered early. This has not borne out. Early neutered kittens share the behavioral benefits listed above and temperament problems have not been documented. Kittens neutered early may be stunted or small. Actually, early neutering delays the closure of the bone growth plates making for a slightly taller cat. Early neutered kittens will have a narrowed urethra that will predispose them to urinary blockage. This has not borne out, either. Urethral dimensions in male cats do not vary based on the age at neutering. Early neuter predisposes to capital physis fracture or slipping. There is actually some truth to this one so let us explain this orthopedic problem. Physis is the medical term for a bone growth plate; that plate is the area on an immature bone where the bone is actively growing in length. The bone in this area is softer and the two pieces can slip apart creating a problem for the growing bone. The "capital physis" is the growth plate of the head of the femur (one of the hip bones). If it slips, then surgery (afemoral head and neck ostectomy) is needed to restore function. Early neutering is one of several factors correlated to slipping a capital physis, the other risk factors are being male, and being overweight. The problem seems to be a combination of being overweight and having delayed closure of the growth plates (as occurs with neuter before age six months). This injury is not common among early neutered kittens but early neutered kittens are overrepresented among cats with this injury. A 2002 study out of Cornell University that followed 1600 cats for 11 years found no diseases, injuries or other issues common in kittens neutered between ages 3.5 months and six months versus those neutered after age six months. Ask your veterinarian about early neutering; some prefer that kittens weigh at least 3 pounds so that the tissues are not too difficult to manipulate. What is Done Exactly The feline neuter is one of the simplest surgical procedures performed in all of veterinary medicine. The cat fasts overnight so that anesthesia is given on an empty stomach. The scrotum is opened with a small incision and the testicles are brought out. The cords are either pulled free and tied to each other or a small suture is used to tie the cords and the testicle is cut free. The skin incision on the scrotum is small enough so as not to require stitches of any kind. Recovery There is minimal recovery with this procedure. Some clinics discharge kittens on the same day as surgery. There should be no bleeding or swelling. It is a good idea not to bathe the kitten until the incisions have healed for 10 to 14 days from the time of surgery.

Category: Pilling a Cat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English This is Sammie, our model for today. He has volunteered to take an amoxicillin tablet for our demonstration. Our technician will be assisting, and she will use a "kitty burrito." These directions are for a right-handed person, so reverse them if you are left-handed. The cat will want to back away from the pill, so hold him in the crook of your left elbow so that he has nowhere to go. The pill is held in your right hand. With your left hand, take the cat by the cheeks and lift his nose to the ceiling. His mouth will automatically drop slightly open. Use a finger of your left hand to open his lower jaw wider. He has no strength in the lower jaw in this position and cannot bite. Place the pill as far back as possible into the mouth. Let the cat’s face go, and watch for lip-licking motions, which usually indicate that the pill has been swallowed. Some cats are good at deception, so it is a good idea to open the mouth after a moment to see if the pill has been swallowed. If possible, squirt a small amount of water into the cat’s mouth to promote swallowing. This helps nudge the pill all the way into the stomach where it belongs. Some medicines may temporarily lodge in the esophagus and can cause irritation if the medicine’s pH is in an “unfriendly” range. Mistakes to avoid: Don’t forget to check the cat’s mouth before releasing him. Many cats know you are waiting to see the licking motions and will try to fool you. If the pill is still in the mouth when you check, just reach a finger in and tip the pill further back on the tongue, or allow the cat to spit the pill out and begin again. If the cat tries to swat your hand away with a paw, you can wrap the cat in a towel so that his head is sticking out, but the feet are inside the towel wrap. This is often called the "kitty burrito," and will help to keep his paws (and claws) away from your hand. My Cat Just Won’t Take A Pill! What Can I Do? Some cats will just not take a pill, regardless of how well you follow these directions. If this is the case with your cat, you may want to investigate an alternative method of providing your cat with the medicine they need. Compounding pharmaciescan take medications normally only available in pill form and create alternative methods of providing that medication, such as in liquid or capsule form or in chewable tablets flavored with fish or chicken.

Category: Senior Cats' Health Issues
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A cat's health changes with age. Physical and mental changes occur, just as they do with people. Most older cats sleep more than they did when young, and they usually sleep more deeply. They may not be able to jump quite as high. They may lose or gain weight, depending on their metabolism. You will most likely find that your cat needs to go the veterinarian a bit more often as it ages. You will also find it beneficial to prevent a health issue from becoming serious by going to the veterinarian early. It's always easier to treat a disease in its early stage. However, it's a mistake to assume that slowing down is just age. It's entirely possible that there's a treatable medical condition behind not wanting to play or to be petted. If you see a sudden slow down, it's definitely time to see the veterinarian. But remember, even a gradual change can be caused by a medical issue. A trip to the veterinarian is warranted if a cat: Changes in Senses Vision, hearing, and taste can be affected in senior cats. These changes may be so subtle that you may not notice them, because cats can easily compensate for these slow changes. For cats, losing clear vision is not a big problem -- unless that cat is also deaf. (You can test your cat’s hearing by snapping your fingers behind the cat’s head to see if there is a response.) A wax build up or an ear infection can affect hearing, so make sure the ears are normal before assuming the cat is deaf. If the cat’s senses of taste and smell have altered, food may not be as appetizing as it once was. If your cat isn’t eating, try warming up some canned food a tiny bit to see if the smell and taste are more attractive to the cat that way. Behavior Cats mellow with age, and are usually more interested in lounging in the sun and parking on a lap than they are in racing up and down the stairs. They are less curious and more sedentary. Other than a general mellowing, most behavior changes are related to health issues. If a normally cranky cat can’t get up the effort to be feisty, something is probably wrong. If a normally sweet cat is suddenly cranky, that’s also a warning sign. Because stress is particularly bad for senior cats, now is not the best time to add a kitten to your household. A kitten’s energy and desire for play could cause behavior you don’t want in your elderly cat. Senility can affect cats, although it’s a bit more common in dogs than cats. In veterinary medicine, senility is called cognitive dysfunction. Some of the signs of cognitive dysfunction include restlessness, pacing, staring, increased vocalization, inappropriate urination or defecation, decreased interest in play, appetite changes, decreased grooming, abnormal sleep patterns, memory changes, anxiety, aggression, irritability, etc. There is no specific therapy for cognitive dysfunction. However, supportive therapies that have shown some usefulness in some patients include a diet rich in antioxidants and fish oils; S-adenosylmethionine; environmental enrichment; and L-Deprenyl.  (L-Deprenyl is labeled only for dogs, so its use in cats is off-label.) Health Issues Generally speaking, the most common health problems in aging cats are related to thyroid and kidney issues. The most common thyroid problem in older cats ishyperthyroidism; it's an overproduction of thyroid hormone. The cat's metabolism just keeps increasing to the point where the cat can burn off too much body weight. If hyperthyroidism is left untreated, heart and liver problems will occur, and the cat will get sicker. There are three traditional types of treatments available for hyperthyroidism: radiotherapy, surgery, and medication. A newer treatment option is iodine-restricted dietary management. This dietary aid has shown results in cats who are maintained solely on this diet. Which one of the four treatments is most appropriate for a particular cat will depend on the case. Cats tend to have urinary problems as seniors, either chronic (slow and long term) or acute (rapid onset and urgent). Treatments vary, depending on the particular kidney/bladder disease involved, and may include drugs, prescription diets, and surgery. Liver issues also crop up fairly frequently. When an older cat’s liver develops problems, the four most common causes arehepatic lipidosis(fatty liver);lymphoma(a type of cancer);feline infectious peritonitis; andcholangiohepatitis(inflammation and/or infection of the liver and biliary tree). Dental health issuesmay occur. Bad breath, tartar, and gum inflammation can be signs of tooth damage, periodontal disease, oral neoplasms, oral ulcers, or systemic health issues. Hypertension is a relatively common issue in senior cats. Many diseases (such as chronic kidney failure, hyperthyroidism, glomerular disease, Cushing’s disease, diabetes, etc.) can be associated with hypertension. An older cat’s skin is thinner than a younger cat’s, so older cats are more prone to skin injuries and diseases. Arthritisbecomes more common as cats age. Older cats may need some assistance getting onto the bed, or into litter boxes. Ramps or footstools can provide a step up. Litter boxes may need to be moved to a more convenient place, especially if your cat doesn’t want to climb the stairs, jump into a bathtub, etc. Although each cat’s aging process is a bit different, regular checkups are necessary. Some cats have an annual exam until they reach the age of seven, at which point semi-annual exams may be necessary in order to stay on top of problems before they get out of control. At the semi-annual exam, your veterinarian will do a physical examination, and will probably doblood chemistry tests, urinalysis, fecal examination, etc. Diet The most critical part of preventive health care for a cat is keeping a normal weight. On average, a fat cat will have a shorter lifespan than one who is a normal weight. Geriatric cats need only about two thirds the number of daily calories that young adult cats do. So, if you don’t reduce an older cat’s caloric intake, it may gain weight. If the older cat has already gained weight, putting it on a diet may be tricky (rapid weight loss is particularly bad for cats). Talk to your veterinarian to see how your cat’s weight can best be managed. It may be as simple as getting the cat to play a bit more while cutting the daily intake just a bit. Comfort Because of muscle tone loss and arthritis, a senior cat will tend to prefer sleeping on something other than a hard surface -- even if it has always slept in that special spot by the window – so try to provide a soft bed. Improved muscle tone will make sleeping more comfortable, so encourage a bit of daily exercise. A Fine Time of Life Cats today have a life expectancy of approximately 20. The geriatric years are a time when your cat will desire more attention, want more lap time, etc. Enjoy this special time with your cat.

Category: Sunscreen for Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Sunscreen, or sunblock, can be used on cats and dogs. Pets with light skin and a short or thin hair coat are particularly prone to sunburn, skin cancer, and other solar-induced skin diseases (solar dermatitis, actinic keratosis, actinic dermatitis). If your dog’s coat is shaved during the summer for cooling, sunscreen may also be helpful. Additionally, pets who have suffered hair loss from allergies, surgery, or cancer radiation can benefit from sunscreen. In pets, sunburn can appear as red skin or hair loss. The most common sites for sunburn in cats and dogs are the bridge of the nose, ear tips, the skin surrounding the lips, and any other area where skin pigmentation is low. The skin on the groin, inside legs, and abdomen can also need sunscreen because hair is very thin there and UV light can reflect off of concrete surfaces to affect those areas of skin.  Also, dogs who like to expose their belly to the sun may need sunscreen. The best way to minimize UV exposure in pets is to avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. by keeping the pet inside. If that is not possible, sunscreen can be applied to protect the skin. Select a sunscreen that is fragrance-free, non-staining, and contains UVA and UVB barriers similar to SPF 15 or SPF 30 for humans. Some sunscreen products have been specifically created for pets. If you intend to use sunscreen on a cat, make certain that the product labeling specifically states that it is appropriate and safe for cats. Although some baby sunscreens may be safe for pets,avoid human sunscreens that have ingestion warningsbecause these products contain ingredients that can be toxic if licked by a dog or cat.No matter what sunscreen product you choose, remember to apply liberally and then re-apply regularly during sun exposure. Additionally, there are UV protective clothing or sunsuits for pets. These products may be helpful for protecting dogs who enjoy sunbathing on their backs and exposing the skin on their abdomen to the sun.

Category: Vaccine Titers for Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Your pet receives vaccines on a set schedule to protect them from illness. Vaccines tell the body to make immune cells and antibodies, which work to prevent or reduce the severity of specific diseases. Avaccine titeris a measure of disease-specific antibody levels in the blood. A higher titer means higher antibody levels and potentially greater protection for the animal. Although vaccine titers have historically been expensive, their use is increasing as they become more affordable and easier to measure. Veterinarians sometimes use vaccine titers to decide whether to revaccinate a pet at the scheduled time. The basic idea is that if your pet has enough antibodies to protect them against a disease, revaccination against that disease may not be necessary. It is important to note that thisonlyapplies to the following vaccines: The first three are core vaccines for dogs, while FPV is a core vaccine for cats. Core vaccines are recommended for all pets because the diseases they protect against are widely distributed and can cause significant illness and death. Although titers can be used to make decisions about these core vaccines, it is important to note that titers donotmatter for the rabies vaccine, another core vaccine. Legally, the rabies vaccine must be given at certain time intervals, regardless of how high the rabies antibody titer may be in your pet. Why can't titers be used for all vaccines? The body makes antibodies in response to both vaccination and infection. Therefore, if your pet has high antibody levels against a disease, this can tell us one of three things: For some diseases, high antibody levels do not mean your pet is protected. Therefore, your pet should be revaccinated as scheduled against these diseases, regardless of titer results. For a few diseases, however, high antibody levels do seem to predict protection from illness. These diseases arecanine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, canine parvovirusandfeline panleukopenia virus (FPV). Thus, a high titer for these diseases likely means your pet is protected enough to not need revaccination at that time. Meanwhile, a low titer might suggest the need for revaccination against these diseases, as your pet may not have enough protection. When should vaccine titers be used? Vaccine titers may be useful in a few scenarios. Remember, these scenarios applyonlyto vaccines against canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, canine parvovirus and FPV. Does a low vaccine titer mean my pet is not protected from disease? Not necessarily. Vaccines tell the body to make both antibodies and immune cells. The antibody levels decline faster than the levels of immune cells do. So, even if your pet has very few antibodies, they might have enough immune cells to defend them against disease. Unfortunately, it is hard to measure these immune cells, so a low titer may suggest the need for revaccination. Ultimately, this decision should be up to your veterinarian. It is worth noting, however, that the above does not apply to puppies and kittens. If your puppy or kitten has low antibody levels after completing their initial series of vaccines up to at least 16 weeks of age, they are not protected and thus they should be revaccinated. How often should vaccine titers be measured? That decision should be left to the individual veterinarian and the pet owner. What are the cons of doing vaccine titers? If you're interested in vaccine titers, you should consult your veterinarian about whether they would be a useful option for your pet. They can be a valuable tool in determining whether revaccination is necessary, but they may not be suitable for every animal.

Category: What First Time Cat Owners Should Know
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Perhaps you have never lived with an adult cat before and have decided to bring one into your home for the first time for one of many possible reasons: you adopted an adult because you prefer knowing the cat’s adult temperament, a stray decided to join you (it usually is their choice), or you somehow inherited one. What should you expect, and what do you need? Each cat has their own preferences for almost everything in their world, and it's a learning process for you to find out what those preferences are. Cats typically do not have a dog's happy-go-lucky “Anything is fine!” approach to life. Some cats don't care what goes on around them, and some cats have surgically precise preferences. They will let you know. Indoor/Outdoor The first decision you need to make is whether or not you are going to allow your cat outside or if the cat will remain inside at all times, although it's truly difficult to make an indoor cat out of one that used to live outside. Indoor-only cats are safer because they don't get hit by cars, have fights with other animals, or become prey, but that means they remain away from their natural environment. Indoor cats need enrichment efforts to be happy, and sometimes weight control efforts, because cats were not designed to lounge around on the couch all day eating food they didn't hunt. Outdoor cats need their indoor basic needs met, such as hiding spaces, resting areas, vertical spaces, and so on. The choice should be made balancing potential dangers outdoors against possible boredom and weight gain indoors. You can take indoor cats outside for walks on feline-specific harnesses and leashes. If you decide to keep your cat indoors only, never let them out by themselves; do not allow “once in a while” forays into the great outdoors and assume they will remain in your yard. The day the cat comes home, you will need the following. The only things you absolutely must have for a cat are food, something in which to eat and drink, and a litter box filled with litter. Initially, you can use any bowl for water and food, but eventually, you can switch to food dispensing and puzzle toys. If you prefer a bowl, get a bacteria-resistant stainless steel or ceramic. Real cat food is necessary (dog food does not have enough protein, although it's better than letting a stray go hungry overnight) and you definitely need litter boxes and litter as soon as you possibly can. In a pinch, a cardboard box filled with sand is good temporarily. If you know what your cat was eating before arriving at your house, use that same food. If you'd like to change to something else, mix the two foods together, gradually increasing the percentage of the new food over a few days. If you have no clue what the cat was eating, then any new cat food will have to do. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they must have a meat-based diet. Cats break down protein to meet their blood sugar requirements, not the carbohydrates that people use. The overall quality of your cat's nutrition can usually be seen in your cat's health; spending more on good quality food usually translates to fewer veterinary bills. Litter Boxes and Litter The litter box and litter will make more of a difference in how well your cat adapts to your household than anything else you provide. Note that these are two items, not one: a box and litter, both of which come in numerous types. Research tells us that cats prefer much larger litter boxes than what are sold in pet supply stores, and veterinary behaviorists recommend something like a concrete mixing tub found at hardware stores. For one cat, have two boxes in different locations. Some cats like the boxes to be on different floors, or at opposite ends of the house. Most dislike having them adjacent to the washing machine and dryer, and they really don't want it near their food bowls. Older or overweight cats may have difficulty walking up and down stairs or jumping up to litter boxes placed on higher surfaces. Each box should be scooped clean once or twice every single day, and the litter in it should be replaced every one to two weeks. When you are replacing the litter, wash the empty box with a detergent and make sure it's dry before new litter is put in it. While it can be tempting to delay scooping or cleaning the box, don't. Just don't. Cats are fastidious and prefer clean toilets (don't you?). Dirty boxes contribute to behavioral problems in which cats decide to pee and poop outside the box. Sometimes they get in the habit of going outside the box in a way that is appropriately calledinappropriate elimination. You want, with all your heart, to prevent your cat from doing that. Inappropriate elimination is the main reason cats are surrendered to the shelter because it is difficult to live with the odor and clean up of cat urine – which is nasty – and cat poop on your floors and carpeting. Sometimes, it's difficult to get a cat to stop doing it, and the best approach is to prevent it from ever happening. Your first decision about litter is clumping or non-clumping. Clumping litter means the urine ends up formed into a sort of ball that is easily scoopable. Non-clumping litter tends to be clay, which some people prefer because of the way it absorbs odors. Clay, non-scented litter is best. Cats can have an aversion to wood, cedar, and litter pearls. There is scented (to cover up the smell for your nose), unscented (because some cats don't like the fragrance), lightweight (more uses per bag), dust-free (if either of you have respiratory issues), natural (biodegradable and renewable sources such as corn, wood, pine, wheat, recycled paper products, etc.) and flushable (check your local ordinances first, as some cities do not allow flushing). There's even litter for cats who don't like to use the litter box, which has an herbal attractant. Most cats have litter preferences, although some will use any material no matter the texture is or what it smells like. The best way to find out what your cat likes is to offer choices of litter and see which one is used the most. Try a few different types to make this experiment as accurate as possible and give each option enough time for the cat to decide. Items you will need eventually, but do not have to have on Day One. An ID tag is always a good idea so that your neighbors will know your cat is not a stray, although cats can get hung up on them. Even a collar alone will show that this cat is not likely to be a stray. Consider microchipping your cat as well so if they are found and taken to the shelter you can easily be reunited. Only 2% of cats taken to shelters are reunited with their people and a microchip can greatly improve those odds. In the United States, rabies vaccination requirements for cats vary from county to county. Ask your veterinarian what the rabies vaccination requirement is where you live. Even if not required by law, vaccinating outdoor pets against rabies is always a good idea. Once your cat is vaccinated, place the rabies tag on the collar or harness with the ID tag and city license, if a license is required by your municipality. Make sure to get a collar specifically for cats that has a breakaway feature so your kitty won’t get stuck squeezing through tight areas or climbing trees. Unless your cat arrived as a stray or in a cardboard box, you may already have a cat carrier, but if you don't you will need one. Your cat will have to go to the veterinarian sometimes, or you may move, your house may catch on fire, or you may need to be evacuated from a natural disaster. There are many types of carriers: some open in the front, or on top, or both, some come apart, and so on. You cantrain your catto accept it. A scratching post or scratcher box is useful because you don't want your cat scratching your furniture. When the carpet or scratching surface is frayed or worn out you will need to replace it with another one. Scratching is a natural behavior for cats and cannot be eliminated, so it's best to direct the cat to scratch on something of your choice. Clipping nails and flexible nail tips can be beneficial. If your cat has a long-haired coat, you absolutely must have tools to brush it or it will mat, causing skin irritation and an eventual need to be groomed (usually done very short as a lion cut with a clipper). Long-haired cats should have a brush, a comb, and a detangler. Most dog groomers do not accept cats for grooming, and many sensitive cats need to be sedated at the veterinarian's for clipping. If your cat has a short coat, a comb and brush will still be needed, just not as often and likely without the difficult consequences of matting. Your cat may enjoy a cat bed, and some use them more than others. Cats will nap anywhere they feel like it, usually in a warm place such as a spot of sunshine, your lap, on top of your laptop. They may decide that a certain spot on the couch is theirs, which may or may not work for you. Most cats love cat trees. They like climbing the carpeting, hiding in them, looking out the window from the highest part, and slapping around the parts that hang down for that purpose. Place it by a window for your cat's enrichment. Remember to vacuum the hair off from it, and descent it once in a while so it doesn't start to smell. Some cat toys will be left untouched while the cat has a fantastic time whapping around the plastic cap to a bottle or the ring that attaches the cap to the bottle. Pieces of crumpled up paper, pen caps, and so on work as toys. Toys that engage you with your cat are usually appreciated, such as a feather attached to a plastic fishing pole. With cats, you never know what they prefer until you try it. Some cat owners find that anything they purchase that is designed for cats is ignored, and that the cat will decide what is interesting to play with. Toys are what the cat considers to be a toy, not you. Be careful not to give them string, yarn, or ribbons because those can become alinear foreign bodythat must be surgically removed. Toxins Many substances are toxic to cats and learning what they are may help your cat live a longer life. While many people know how dangerous antifreeze or rodenticides are, items such as acetaminophen (Tylenol®), ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, mosquito repellant, nasal decongestants, cannabis, glow sticks, and many flowers found in bouquets - especially lilies, are toxic to cats. If you suspect your cat has ingested any of these items, call your veterinarian or a pet poison hotline and ask if you should bring your cat in. Cats cannot metabolize ibuprofen, acetaminophen (Tylenol®), or other medications the way people do. Do not give any medication, over the counter or prescription, to your cat without discussing it first with your veterinarian. The ASPCA has a list ofplants that are toxicspecifically to cats. Easy Keepers As long as you keep the litter boxes clean and long-haired cats brushed, cats are the easiest of easy keepers. Your life is not ruled by their bladder, they don't need to be walked, you don't need to disinfect a cage or aquarium, you don't need to go to an expensive specialty store for their food, they don't mind being alone for a while, and when they want to be with you, they are with you in spirit and soul. Few aspects of life are as wonderful as a happy cat in your home, purring on your lap. Toxic Substances for Cats Cats are a different species, so some things we can eat or ingest may poison them or even be fatal in some circumstances. If you know what your cat has ingested,you can call theASPCA Poison Control Centerfor a fee, at (888) 426-4435, or contact a veterinarian immediately.

Category: Digging Deeper: Getting the Facts on the Dangers of Antifreeze and Your Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Chances are, you’re already aware of the fact that antifreeze can be a dangerous poison to humans and animals alike. But do you know why the substance is so toxic to pets? Would you know what to do if your pet got into the chemical? Since the winter weather has many people reaching for the antifreeze, theASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC)wants to make sure you know exactly why it’s so important to keep your pets safe from this toxin, what to do if you think they have been exposed, and what can be done to help your pet in the event of an emergency. A key ingredient found in most antifreeze is ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is highly toxic and affects the nervous system and kidneys. What’s worse is that ethylene glycol has a sweet taste, so pets can easily be drawn to and ingest it. It takes only a small amount of ethylene glycol to be potentially fatal.  While problems may start within a couple of hours of ingestion, sometimes early signs may be missed in poisoning cases concerning this ingredient. In six to twelve hours, pets may be markedly ill. While ethylene glycol is most commonly found in antifreeze used in car radiators, that is not the only location it can be found. Antifreeze may also be found in: If you think your pet may have ingested antifreeze, the best thing to do is immediately take them to the veterinary hospital. You’ll also want to be sure to bring with you the packaging from the antifreeze, so the veterinarian can determine the best form of treatment based on the amount ingested and the ingredients listed in the product. At the hospital, the veterinarian will evaluate your pet and run lab tests. If it is uncertain whether your pet was exposed to antifreeze or exposed to enough to be cause for concern, there is a test the veterinarians can run to first determine if the exposure will be harmful or problematic. The good news is, if your pet has ingested antifreeze, there is an antidote. However, it isextremelyimportant to get treatment started as soon as possible. What Else Do you Need to Know? Pet-safe antifreezesdoexist. Instead of containing ethylene glycol, these versions of antifreeze contain propylene glycol—which has a much wider margin of safety. It is still best practice to keep pets out of any type of chemicals, even pet-safe antifreeze. If you suspect your pet has been exposed to any poisonous substances, contact your veterinarian or call Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) at 888-426-4435 immediately.

Category: Expandable Foaming Glues like Gorilla Glue Cause Obstructions in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If swallowed in liquid form, some polyurethane-based glue products can create a life-threatening stomach blockage because they expand and harden once in the stomach. Glues that contain diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), (e.g.  Gorilla Glue™ and Elmer’s Glue-All Max®)are designed to foam and expand after exposure to moisture. These types of glue are most typically used by woodworkers. Unfortunately, if a pet swallows glue with MDI in it, the warm and moist environment of the stomach causes the glue to foam and expand into a large mass. The glue is thought to harden within a few minutes after ingestion, effectively  becoming a foreign body and blocking the entry of food either in or out of the stomach.  When a large amount is ingested, it  hardens in the shape of the stomach. The hardened material usually can't be vomited up because it's too big to go through the esophagus.  While other animals have been known to eat these glues, the typical patient is a dog. Even if you see your pet swallow the glue, do not force him to vomit because this could cause the expanding glue to get stuck in the esophagus or be inhaled into the lungs. Surgically speaking, it is more difficult to  remove the glue from the esophagus than from the stomach. Signs that a pet has eaten this glue can be seen anywhere from 15 minutes to 20 hours after ingestion. These signs include vomiting (sometimes it is bloody), an enlarged stomach, stomach pain, lack of appetite, and lethargy. X-rays of the abdomen are typically necessary to arrive at a diagnosis. Surgery is the only possible treatment as the foam is not digestible.  Surgery is usually done on an emergency basis since stomach ulceration and rupture can occur if the glue is not removed from the stomach in a timely manner. Ingesting a few drops of these glues may not be a problem and would likely just cause mild gastrointestinal distress. If you don’t know how much your pet ingested, then it is wise to consult with your veterinarian, who may recommend taking X-rays. Because MDI isn’t always listed on the product label, consider any expanding adhesive as potentially containing it. To prevent your pets from ingesting these glues or any potentially harmful substance, store them properly and securely where there is no chance your pets could get them. The ASPCANational Animal Poison Controlis available 24 hours a day at 888-426-4435. Expect an initial consultation fee of around $100.00 and additional follow-up is at no charge. You will be assigned a case number your veterinarian can use to communicate with a toxicology specialist before beginning treatment.

Category: Toxic Disinfectants: What to Use and What Not to Use Around Your Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cleaning and disinfecting are more important than ever during theCOVID-19outbreak, but cleaning always needs to be done no matter what. Unfortunately, there is a lot of confusion about which cleaning products can be toxic to pets. In fact, many cleaners are okay around pets, especially if they are allowed to dry or the pet is only exposed to small amounts. But which common cleaning and disinfecting products can be problematic in our furry friends? Remember to Read the Labels and Use your Thinking Cap Many common cleaning and disinfecting products made for the surfaces in your home are not meant to be used on yourself. For example, don’t use wipes meant to disinfect surfaces on your skin. If something isn’t safe for your skin, don’t put it on your pet either. Never spray or wipe down your pet with cleaning products. Avoid getting cleaners into the eyes, mouth, or nose, just as you would with yourself. Read product labels and make sure they are safe for pets. Call your veterinarian if you are unsure if something is safe, or if you think your pet has had access to something toxic. You can also check online or phone (for a fee) theASPCA’s Animal Poison Control. A group of German investigators has identified several commonly available disinfectants that should inactivate SARS-CoV-2. These include: Acidic Products Acidic products can be found in certain cleaning agents, such as toilet bowl cleaners. They can cause pretty severe damage to any type of tissue they contact, especially if eaten or put in the eyes. Symptoms start to occur immediately and can include pain, crying/whimpering, trouble swallowing, vomiting, mouth and esophageal sores/ulcers, skin redness and sores, or eye redness and squinting. After calling your vet, offer water or milk if the product was eaten, or rinse the area (ideally for 10-15 minutes) with room temperature water. Alkaline Products These cleaning products include sodium hydroxide (lye), potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide (household ammonia), and potassium permanganate. They are often used as drain openers, dishwasher detergents, and toilet bowl cleaners. These products can penetrate deeply into the tissues on contact and cause significant damage. Unlike acidic products, pain is not immediate, so symptoms may not be obvious at first. Signs associated with alkaline product ingestion include drooling, not eating, fever, oral redness and ulcers, trouble swallowing, vomiting, belly pain, and dark, tarry stools. Eye or skin contact can lead to redness as well. Call your vet and flush the mouth or contact area for 10-15 min with room temperature water. Bleach Liquid bleach is made of sodium hypochlorite. If it comes in contact with the skin or eyes, it can cause irritation such as pain or redness. It can also cause irritation along the respiratory tract if inhaled (sneezing, trouble breathing) and along the gastrointestinal tract (vomiting, loose stool, poor appetite) if eaten/drunk. Highly concentrated bleach (6% sodium hypochlorite or higher, may also be called “ultra bleach”) can cause pretty severe damage, such as ulcers in the mouth and GI tract if eaten. In addition to calling your vet, offer milk if the pet has eaten bleach. Bathe the pet in liquid dishwashing soap until the bleach smell is gone if it has gotten on the skin. Bleach combined with an acidic cleaner is dangerous, as it can create hypochlorous acid and chlorine gas, which is toxic if inhaled. It can cause inflammation/irritation of the mouth, throat, and GI tract. This gas is also toxic to people. Cationic Detergents (also known as Quaternary Ammonia Compounds) Cleaning products such as all-purpose cleaners and sanitizers are commonly used cationic detergents. Sanitizers include surface disinfecting wipes; pool algaecides; some fabric softeners; some dryer sheets; some laundry detergents, especially liquid ones; and some toilet tank drop in products (these are only a concern if the tablet or capsule itself is ingested, but they're okay after being diluted in the toilet water). Household products in the U.S. that have cationic detergents have to list these under an ingredient list on the front label. Cleaners with no list on the front label would not have cationics or bleach in them. Even at low concentrations (2%), they can cause symptoms similar to alkaline products. In addition, weakness, twitching, seizures, collapse, and trouble breathing may be seen if eaten. Call your vet, then feed milk if product was ingested or use dishwashing liquid to remove the product from the skin. Detergents (Non-Ionic/Anionic) and Soaps Non-ionic and anionic detergents can be found in many types of soaps, such as hand soap and shampoo, and cleaning products such as hand dishwashing detergent. For the most part, the toxicity level in soaps is mild. These can cause irritation if they get into the eyes after which you may see eye redness or squinting. If eye irritation has occurred, you can rinse your pet’s eyes with room temperature water or saline solution. If these products are eaten, they can cause stomach upset, vomiting, and loose stool. If these symptoms are seen, call your vet immediately. Hand Sanitizers and Alcohol Isopropanol, also known as rubbing alcohol, is absorbed quickly by mouth and is readily absorbed through the skin, which can cause intoxication if enough is absorbed. Breathing in the fumes can also be problematic in small, confined areas. Ethanol and ethyl alcohol are similar types of alcohol, all of which can be found in hand sanitizer. Usually, hand sanitizer has other ingredients to give it that jelly consistency, such as propylene glycol. Propylene glycol and ethanol or ethyl alcohol are NOT the same thing as what is found in antifreeze, which is ethylene glycol. Hand sanitizers do not cause antifreeze poisoning. In fact, most hand sanitizers are rarely an issue if eaten in very small amounts (e.g. a pet licking your hands after you put some on yourself). Signs of alcohol toxicity, although very rare, can include vomiting, wobbliness, twitching, trouble breathing, or becoming comatose. If these signs are noted, go see your vet as soon as possible. Keep your pet warm in the meantime. Phenols The levels of phenols in household cleaners are generally not toxic enough to be of concern anymore; if exposed, you generally find the kind of issues you see with anionic/nonionic detergents. Phenols can be found in antiseptics, germicides, household cleaners with pine oil products and disinfectants such as some cleaning sprays. They can cause problems in the GI tract if eaten. Direct irritation can be an issue if a pet walks on a surface that isn’t yet dry. Cats seem to be especially sensitive to these products. Pain, redness, and ulcers may be noted on the skin or paws with contact. Rapid breathing, tremors, twitching, and incoordination can be seen if the pet eats the product. Call your vet and bathe the pet with liquid dish soap if the product contacts the skin. If You Are Unsure The ASPCA Poison Control Center says that most cleaning agents can be used safely in homes as long as label recommendations are followed. In this scenario, better safe than sorry. If you are in doubt about using a product where your dog or cat can come into contact with it, be sure to check with an animal poison control center or call your veterinarian.

Category: Cannabis Toxicity in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An Overview Cannabisgenerally refers to the products of theCannabis sativaplant, commonly known as marijuana. TheCannabis sativaplant uniquely has over 100 different chemicals called phytocannabinoids. (Phytomeans plant.) The most well-known of these isdelta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, referred to as THC. THC has psychoactive effects on the brain, making it popular for recreational use. Psychoactive substances affect the mind or behavior and work on the nervous system, altering mood and feeling and making marijuana popular for recreational use. However, because THC affects many other body systems, it also has many medical uses. In fact, marijuana has been safely used medically for centuries. In the United States, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has classified THC as a Schedule 1 drug. Schedule 1 drugs have no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Despite this classification, almost all states have legalized marijuana for either recreational or medical use. Another cannabinoid found in theCannabis sativaplant, called cannabidiol (CBD), is also popular, but because it does not have psychoactive effects, its popularity is primarily because of medical benefits. Marijuana contains at least 1% THC, although this percentage depends on what part of the plant is used and how it is processed. Products made from marijuana seeds contain little or no THC, but products made from the plant's buds or flowers can contain up to 10% THC. In recent years, selective plant breeding has produced levels of THC up to 50%. The United States government has legalized a differentCannabis sativaplant called industrial hemp. Hemp can contain no more than 0.3% THC, but it can contain larger amounts of a second phytocannabinoid, cannabidiol or CBD. Because it contains little THC, the DEA does not control hemp or its products, and they are not considered illegal by the federal government. Because it is not illegal, many dietary supplements containing CBD are now being marketed for medical use in animals. How It Works The phytocannabinoids THC and CBD inCannabis sativawork through the body’s natural endocannabinoid system (ECS). (Endomeans self.) The chemicals in the ECS interact with the cannabinoid receptors found throughout the body, helping to regulate physiologic functions, and may be involved in different diseases. Using drugs to influence this system may help in the treatment of disease. The medical effects of THC and CBD differ because they interact differently with the endocannabinoid system. In human medicine, CDB has been used to treat anxiety, improve appetite, relieve nausea, control certain types of seizures, and assist in sleep disorders. In animals, pain associated with osteoarthritis and seizures associated with epilepsy are common uses of CBD. CBD and Supplements CBD is not psychoactive like THC but may have medical benefits. CBD is not a scheduled drug by the DEA and is an added ingredient in dietary supplements sold online, at dispensaries, and available over the counter. THC and CBD are also available by prescription, and your veterinarian may prescribe one or the other for treating your pet, most commonly for pain management. The difference between supplements and prescription drugs is that unapproved products like supplements are not regulated, nor are they assessed for consistency. Supplement labels may inaccurately list the amount of CBD in the product. More importantly, supplements may contain chemicals such as synthetic cannabinoids that are not listed on the label but may be dangerous to your pet. In general, marijuana is safe. People are generally exposed to higher amounts of THC than pets because people more commonly smoke, rather than ingest, marijuana. THC that is ingested (for example, marijuana cookies) is removed mainly by the liver before it can get into the blood. THC that is inhaled bypasses the liver, and most of it enters the blood. Toxicity in THC vs CBD Because of its psychogenic effects, products containing THC are more likely to cause clinical signs that look like toxicity in dogs or cats. However, in contrast to marijuana or THC, products containing CBD have not been associated with significant toxicity or side effects in dogs. Toxicity or side effects tocannabismost likely reflect the effects of THC rather than CBD but are rarely lethal. In cases in which side effects were reported with a supplement containing CBD, the supplement also contained THC. Even then, the side effects involved the gastrointestinal tract (vomiting, diarrhea) and were not severe. An exception is those products that contain synthetic cannabinoids or if other drugs have been unknowingly added. These products can be life-threatening. This is another reason that it is important to bring the actual product to your veterinarian. Different cannabinoids have varied effects. Each cannabinoid may reach a different area of the body. Responses to CBD among animals may reflect the differences in individual endocannabinoid systems. Keep any medicinal or recreational products out of the reach of pets and children. Signs of Marijuana Toxicity in Pets The legalization of marijuana has led to increased reports of toxicity in dogs and cats. Most pet exposure to marijuana occurs after eating homemade baked goods containing the dried marijuana plant (about 70%), followed by eating the plant itself (about 10%). For marijuana toxicity to occur, the pet must eat a large amount of marijuana. The amount of marijuana plant necessary to cause death in a dog or cat has not been determined. However, the least amount that has ever been associated with signs of toxicity is 3 to 9 g per kg of animal weight (about 7 to 20 g per lb.). For comparison, the average marijuana cigarette generally contains only about 0.5 to 1 gram of plant material. A problem with dogs ingesting marijuana in baked goods such as brownies or cookies is that they oftencontain chocolate, which is also toxic to dogs. Baked products may also contain concentrated forms of marijuana butter or oil. Another possible reason for marijuana toxicity in dogs is that marijuana may contain unsafe, illegal substances such as other drugs or synthetic cannabinoids. In cases where death has been reported in dogs, the marijuana most commonly was in baked goods. Chocolate may contain thesugar substitute xylitol, a substance that is toxic to dogs. After ingestion, the time it takes for clinical signs to occur and how long it takes for the pet to become normal again depends, in part, on how much marijuana and what else might have been ingested. Clinical signs can appear as early as 30 minutes after exposure but may take up to two hours to occur. After ingestion, pets may become normal again in as little as a couple of hours, but more often, it takes 24 to 72 hours for pets to return to normal. A common clinical sign of marijuana toxicity is loss of urination control. Because this sign does not occur with other toxins, it helps with the diagnosis. Other common clinical signs of toxicity include: Rarely, the pet may become aggressive. With the most severe toxicity, seizures may occur, or the pet may become comatose. Pets that already have illness may be more likely to become ill. Clinical signs in these pets may depend on what other illnesses they have. Compared to humans, a dog has many cannabinoid receptors around the brain that help with balance. When dogs ingest a large amount of THC, they may become uncoordinated and unable to stand. This THC side effect in dogs is not likely to occur with CBD or in other species. Diagnosing marijuana toxicity can be difficult. It is important that your veterinarian be given any information that might help with identifying the cause of the clinical signs. Bringing the actual product your pet was exposed to with you to the clinic can help. There is no risk to you as the pet owner because your veterinarian is not required to report toxicity to local law enforcement. In humans, urine tests are used to detect chemicals metabolized in urine from THC. However, animals do not make these metabolites, so these types of urine tests are not helpful. Treatment for Toxicity Diagnosis and treatment of marijuana toxicity depend on a well-informed veterinarian. There is no specific antidote for marijuana toxicity. Treatments are given help to control the clinical signs. This might include fluids or drugs to control vomiting and, for severe toxicity, antiseizure medications. Usually, the patient is sent home after a physical examination. The pet can be kept in a confined space and monitored until the effects wear off. However, more intense in-hospital observation and support are needed if the patient has lost consciousness. If less than 30 minutes have passed since theCannabishas been eaten, it may be possible to induce vomiting. However, the pet may inhale stomach contents, particularly if it is acting sedated. This option may be necessary if the pet ingested a life-threatening toxin. In more severe cases of toxicity, your veterinarian may give activated charcoal orally. This is a liquid that helps to bind ingested toxins. The toxin passes along with the charcoal when the pet defecates. However, this should not be given to patients that are sedated. Cannabinoids might interact with other medications. For example, they may cause other medications to leave the body more slowly. It is important to notify your veterinarian if your pet is receivingcannabisor any supplement. The ASPCANational Animal Poison Controlis available 24 hours a day at 888-426-4435.

Category: Electronic Cigarettes are Toxic to Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Electronic cigarettes, often called e-cigs, are marketed as an alternative to cigarette smoking.  They are also referred to as personal vaporizers or electronic nicotine delivery systems. These devices have a cylindrical body that holds a cartridge containing a liquid solution; some resemble tobacco cigarettes.  The solution, termed “e-liquid” or “e-juice,” contains a base material, flavoring compounds, and nicotine. The base material is generally propylene glycol and either vegetable glycerin or polyethylene glycol. Glycerin and propylene glycol are of low toxicity when eaten, but the amount in the refill bottles (usually 10-30% of what's in the bottle) is low enough to not be much of a concern; nicotine is the bigger issue. Whether any of the compounds used are toxic if inhaled long term is not known. The nicotine levels in these e-liquids can vary in concentration from being completely nicotine-free up to 36 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) of nicotine. For marketing purposes, the “/mL” part is frequently dropped, and the e-liquids are advertised as having X mg of nicotine rather than X mg/mL. In some e-cigs, the user controls the amount of nicotine delivered by adjusting the flow of e-liquid from the cartridge. An e-cig with a full cartridge can contain up to 36 mg of nicotine, which doesn’t sound like a lot until you factor in how toxic nicotine is.  Clinical signs of nicotine poisoning can be seen in dogs and cats exposed to a mere 0.5 mg per pound of body weight.  For cats and small dogs, ingesting 20 mg of nicotine can be lethal. Even more dangerous are the bottles of e-liquid that are used to recharge the e-cig cartridge: the nicotine in these bottles can range from 10 mL to 60 mL or more.  So a 30-mL bottle of 36 mg/mL e-liquid will contain 1080 mg of nicotine, more than enough to prove fatal for even a very large dog if the contents are ingested. Nicotine is readily absorbed by ingestion as well as through the skin.  Pets may be exposed when they chew up the e-cigs or the bottles containing e-juice or even when they walk through puddles of spilled e-juice and get it on their paws.  The signs of nicotine poisoning may begin within 15 to 30 minutes of exposure to the e-liquid; in contrast, signs of nicotine poisoning following eating tobacco products may take a few hours as the nicotine must be released from the tobacco. The first signs normally seen with toxic exposure to nicotine include: With severe intoxications, signs may progress to include: Further progression of signs may result in profound weakness, paralysis, abnormal heart rhythms (including cardiac arrest), hypotension, coma, and death. Prompt and aggressive veterinary care is required to successfully manage poisoning from e-juice exposure.  Because the e-juice is rapidly absorbed across the mucous membranes of the mouth, standard decontamination measures such as inducing vomiting are usually not helpful.  Treatment includes managing convulsions and seizures, treating heart and blood pressure abnormalities, ensuring adequate respiration, and providing intravenous fluids to enhance nicotine elimination.The prognosis for patients exposed to large amounts of nicotine can be quite grave depending on how quickly veterinary care is obtained, and even with aggressive veterinary care, some patients will not survive.

Category: Yeast Dough Dangers in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you bake yeast bread from scratch, it is essential that you keep all raw bread dough away from your pets. Ingesting it can cause serious problems and be life threatening for your pet. Doughs that do not contain yeast are less of a concern, but can still cause gastrointestinal problems. Why is it so dangerous to eat? Yeast is a microscopic fungus that, under the right conditions, makes carbon dioxide gas and ethanol (alcohol) from sugar. This effect is great for making bread because gas makes the dough rise and ethanol flavors the bread before burning off in the oven. However, this process is dangerous when it occurs in your animal's stomach. Being moist and warm, the stomach is essentially the perfect environment for yeast to grow and pump out carbon dioxide and ethanol. The buildup of gas and rising dough in the stomach is painful and can lead to a condition calledbloat: “the mother of all emergencies.”Also known as gastric dilatation and volvulus, or GDV, bloat is where the expanding stomach puts pressure on surrounding areas and decreases blood flow to important organs. Even more dangerous, the stomach may eventually twist, cutting off blood flow even more. The twisted stomach can reduce blood flow throughout the whole body, leading to a serious condition calledshock. Several steps are needed to save a bloated dog’s life. Part of the problem is that the main three steps - decompress the stomach, give IV fluids to fight shock, and stabilize the heart rhythm - should all be done at the same time and as quickly as possible. Although GDV can be life threatening, death from yeast dough in pets is usually due to the effects of ethanol. Ethanol is alcohol, like that found in beer, wine and spirits,  so the ethanol produced by yeast can causealcohol poisoning. This poisoning can lead to low blood sugar, low blood pressure, decreased body temperature,seizuresand trouble breathing. Signs Early signs of yeast dough ingestion are generally those associated with bloat. Your pet may try to vomit or retch but not produce anything or maybe just a little white foam. Additional signs include an enlarged abdomen due to the buildup of gas and dough, in addition to weakness, increased heart rate, and collapse. Signs of alcohol poisoning generally occur two or more hours after dough is ingested. You might be able to smell alcohol on your pet's breath. Your pet may seem drunk, becoming uncoordinated and disoriented. They may also feel cold to the touch. Seizures and trouble breathing are two other serious signs of alcohol poisoning. What should I Do? Get to a veterinarian as soon as possible, as this is potentially a life-threatening emergency. If your pet just recently ate the dough and isn't showing any symptoms yet, your veterinarian may try to induce vomiting to remove it from the stomach. As you can imagine, bread dough is so gummy and sticky that it is hard to vomit up. So, other methods of removal will likely be necessary. Yeastlovethe warmth in a stomach. If you make the stomach cold, you can slow the yeast's growth and the production of alcohol and gas. This slow down can be accomplished by feeding ice chips or flushing the stomach with cold water. These treatments can also break up the dough and make it easier to pass through the rest of the digestive system. In rare cases, the dough may need to be surgically removed. Treatment also involves dealing with your pet's specific clinical signs and may entail giving intravenous fluids to correct any blood abnormalities and to speed up removing alcohol from the bloodstream. If your pet is cold, heating blankets, warm intravenous fluids and other techniques may be used to warm them up. Depending on your pet's symptoms, medications may be given to reduce pain, treat seizures, correct breathing abnormalities, manage vomiting, etc. The veterinarian will need to monitor your pet for at least 12 hours until they recover. Prognosis Pets generally do well if the yeast dough is removed quickly and they are treated soon after ingestion. Unfortunately, pets suffering from severe alcohol poisoning, bloat, or GDV have a more guarded prognosis. To prevent this life-threatening situation altogether, avoid letting your pets have access to raw yeast dough by letting it rise in areas your pets can't reach, such as elevated places in the kitchen, or in a closed oven or microwave.

Category: Fear-related Aggression in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Sarah Nugen, Class of 2023;Sandra Robbins BS, CVT, VTS (Anesthesia & Analgesia), CPDT-KSA, KPA-CTP;Katharine Schwarz, RVT, KPA CTP Fear in Cats Just like us, cats feel fear and their behavior changes in response to it. What makes one cat fearful or anxious may not make another one feel that way. We observe a cat’s body language to understand how they are feeling. Fearful cats make themselves small and are tense. Their bodies will be low to the table or ground, and their legs will be tucked under their bodies. Fearful cats are constantly scanning, and their ears may change directions frequently. Sometimes they are frozen with their ears flattened and their pupils enlarged. Tails may swish or be tucked underneath their bodies. Some cats growl, hiss, swat, scratch, and bite. Fear-related Aggression Fear is a normal emotional response in cats, and just because they are fearful does not mean they will respond aggressively. Each cat’s behavior is individual and influenced by environmental stressors, socialization as kittens, and life experiences. For example, a cat may respond aggressively when fearful at a veterinary clinic for a nail trim, whereas other cats may become frozen. In both situations, the cat perceives a person or the nail trim as threatening; however, both are the same fear response but expressed differently. Cats brought in as kittens frequently fornail trimsmay not be fearful since they had previous positive experiences with lots of treats. Getting to the Source of Fear-related Aggression When diagnosing and treating fear aggression, your veterinarian may take a detailed history to determine your cat’s triggers. They will often ask questions about your cat’s behavior and environment. Behavior changes may occur as a result of pain or other medical conditions. A thorough physical exam and other diagnostics, such as X-rays or blood work, may be needed. Working with a Fear-aggressive Cat There isn’t one single way to treat fear-related aggression because every cat is different. To help your cat feel safe, provide appropriate hiding and vertical spaces. This may be an elevated cat tree, shelf, or quiet room. It is important that your cat can access these spaces all the time, including when there are visitors. Long-term treatment will involve changing emotional and behavioral responses. This is done by reintroducing the triggers, identified in the history in a gradual and systematic way. Food, play, and other rewards may be used for this process. Sometimes medications may be beneficial. Discuss with your veterinarian what may be best for your cat.

Category: Feline Play and Play Aggression
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cats are social animals and enjoy interactions with the humans in their lives.  While some cats are particular, others will play with any object, toy, or person.  Some cats prefer social play with their owners and some enjoy playing by themselves or with other animals in the home. Cats come pre-wired with hunting skills. Most cats develop preferences for toys that copy normal hunting behaviors such as stalking, chasing, pouncing, grabbing, clawing, and biting. Typical kitten play behaviors often mimic these hunting skills. Play postures develop by three weeks of age and can involve social play with other cats and kittens. If cats do not have an outlet, these behaviors may be used inappropriately, resulting in stalking or attacking moving hands and feet. Introducing routines, finding new ways to play, and engaging your cat with healthy play activities encourage positive behavior. Routines can minimize stress and create a predictable pattern for your cat to know how and when they can play. Play times should be at a time of day that works for your schedule. For example, if you are playing with your cat in the evening prior to bed, make sure playtime ends with a special treat that ends the hunting behavior and encourages rest. Toys such as wands, small mice, and fuzzy balls that encourage chasing and do not directly involve interactions with your hands are best. To keep things fresh, it is recommended to have a few toys out at a time and rotate them every two to three days, creating new excitement with each toy rotation. Food puzzles are another alternative to keep your cat engaged. Outdoor exploration can be difficult to recreate inside. Supervised outdoor time in a catio or on leash and harness creates other positive ways to play, interact, and stimulate hunting behaviors. Some cats enjoy walks in an enclosed pet stroller or backpack carrier. You may need tocondition your catbeforehand. Understanding different ways to safely play and interact will encourage appropriate behaviors and strengthen the relationship between you and your cat.

Category: Human Directed Aggression in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have ever had your cat snuggle up to you on the couch then nip at your hand when you try to pet them, you are not alone. This is just one scenario in which some cats have shown aggression to their owners. Many other situations can lead to cats swatting, scratching, or trying to bite their human partners. While these are unwanted behaviors from our feline friends, there are often logical explanations for their actions. Trying to stop the aggression starts with understanding when and why it might be happening. Then, you can determine how to approach the problem behavior. Play-related Aggression This type of aggression occurs when play goes too far or when a cat misdirects play behavior. Many owners roughhouse with their cats, especially as kittens, using their hands as objects for the cats to mouth or kick. While it may seem cute and harmless at first, it can teach your cat that the correct way to get your attention is to play fight. To prevent this behavior from becoming a problem, use toys as the target. If playing with your cat causes them to get too aroused or worked-up, the play becomes rough or escalates to aggression toward you, end the session and walk away or try to redirect their focus onto a toy. Another sign of play-related aggression is stalking and attacking moving feet. Cats often use predatory behavior when playing, therefore try to redirect your cat to appropriate objects. Waving wand toys, tossing toy mice, or even skittering pieces of kibble across the floor can help satisfy the desire for that predatory style of play. Petting-induced Aggression When aggression is triggered by petting, understanding why this happens is the tricky part. It seems like your cat wanted the attention and petting in the first place. Just because your cat wants your attention or closeness doesn’t necessarily mean they want to be petted. Sometimes, cats only want to be near (or on) you without being petted, or maybe they do want to be petted but not in that spot or not for very long. Most cats prefer to be petted on the top of the head, cheeks, or under the chin. Many cats do not like long strokes down the back or having their tail touched; every cat has their individual preferences. The key is for you to find out what your cat likes and stick to those areas. For cats who only tolerate brief bouts of petting, try petting for a few seconds and then stop. If they ask for more by nudging or leaning into you, then keep going for a few seconds more. Another common misconception is that when cats roll over, they want you to pet them on their belly, but this isn’t always an invitation to touch them on their tummy. Remember to respect your cat’s likes and dislikes. Defensive or Fear-related Aggression Cats use aggressive behavior to defend themselves when feeling anxiety or fear. This aggression often includes situations during which the cat is being handled or restrained, such as for nail trims, brushing, veterinary exams, or when there is a potential threat – real or perceived – from another animal or human. Most cats prefer to avoid conflict, but when they cannot, they may use aggression to protect themselves and feel safe. Cats may be anxious about restraint. If routine handling for grooming or other procedures was not part of their kitten socialization and exposure, they may be anxious in those situations as adults. Preventing this type of aggression can be done by creating positive associations with handling and new people from an early age. It’s not just about exposing young cats them to these things, it needs to be a positive experience, usually by pairing it with high-value food. If the anxiety or defensive aggression has already started, more focused behavior modification will be needed. Pain-related Aggression Physical discomfort can also be a factor in human-directed aggression. Painful cats have a lower tolerance for human interaction. If a previous experience was painful and your cat learned to associate that handling with pain, he may be aggressive when handled. As with any type of aggression, but especially with a recent onset, see your veterinarian for a physical examination to search for subtle signs of pain or illness. Redirected Aggression This aggression occurs when your cat becomes aroused or highly upset. When that target is inaccessible, they may redirect their aggression onto something else, such as you or another pet. One of the most common scenarios is when a cat sees an outdoor cat on the other side of a window or door, seemingly taunting them. Because the cat cannot access the intruder, they turn their frustration and aggression to what is closest. Sometimes these episodes can be quite extreme. This reaction can become a learned association, and the aggression toward that individual can recur even without another outdoor cat present. With redirected aggression, you have to identify the trigger and prevent your cat from being exposed to it. Treatment Whenever your cat is exhibiting aggression, consult with your veterinarian. Take note of when the aggression occurs and what events precede it. This information, together with an examination, will help your veterinarian determine the next steps. If pain or illness is contributing to the aggression, treatment should start with addressing those issues. For petting-induced and play-related aggression, changing the way you interact with your cat, and learning your cat’s petting preferences may be needed. Frequently, you need to alter your behavior. If fear and anxiety cause your cat to react defensively, then your cat may need behavior modification. In some cases, medication may be needed to lessen your cat’s anxiety or overarousal. Regardless of the type of aggression or its cause, punishment should never be your response. While it might seem normal to scold or correct your cat, it may cause more harm than good. If your cat is fearful, being punished increases anxiety, potentially making the behavior worse. This is also true if your cat is in a highly aroused state. Punishment does not teach the cat what the appropriate behavior is, does not improve the cat’s underlying emotional state, and can often have unintended consequences. Do your best to avoid known triggers and become familiar with changes in your cat’s body language indicating anxiety or impending aggression (see poster below). If your cat becomes aggressive, calmly stop, and remove yourself from the situation. Cats have limited ways that they can communicate to their humans that something is bothering them. Aggression is one way they try to tell us what’s wrong. Take that information and use it to help them feel safe by avoiding that trigger.

Category: Psychogenic Alopecia
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In the cat, overgrooming, licking, biting, chewing, and compulsively pulling out hair can lead to hair loss, thin, uneven coats, or baldness. This behavior typically has a medical cause that must be ruled out before a behavioral diagnosis of psychogenic alopecia can be made. Psychogenic means “of the mind”. Psychogenic alopecia, also known as self-trauma, is a condition in which cats compulsively pull out their hair, leading to thin, uneven coats or baldness. This behavior typically serves as a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning all possible medical reasons must be ruled out before a behavioral diagnosis can be made. Psychogenic means “of the mind”. A study by Stephen E. Waisglass, et al., published inThe Journal of the AmericanVeterinary Medical Association,involving 21 cats suspected of this condition, found that 16 had medical reasons for their behavior, two were purely cases of psychogenic alopecia, and three had medical and behavioral causes. The medical issues primarily included unfavorable reactions to food, allergies, or parasites, with half of the cases having more than one cause. Causes When this hair loss due to self-trauma has behavioral causes rather than medical, it is called psychogenic alopecia. Behavioral causes are often linked to environmental stress, frustration, or conflict. Potential triggers for this behavior range from changes in the household environment, including the introduction of new pets or people, to competition for resources in multicat households, lack of hiding spaces, insufficient mental enrichment, and even the sight of neighborhood cats. Although it can also stem from a compulsive disorder, this is relatively rare. Cats in multicat households are particularly prone to displaying this behavior when their basic needs are unmet. Clinical Signs Initially, the skin may appear irritated due to pruritus (itch). Itchiness can lead to scratching and licking, chewing, biting, and hair loss, and is the most common symptom of skin disease in cats and dogs. The areas most affected are the flanks (sides). You may not initially notice your cat is overgrooming, as it often occurs only when they are alone or at night; however, the effects on the skin can be seen. Diagnosis To diagnose the reason for hair loss in your cat, your veterinarian may start with basic tests, including cytology, to look for infections and skin scrapings to check for mites, followed by fungal cultures and flea medications. They may also conduct blood tests and a urinalysis, along with a thyroid profile, to assess your cat’s overall health. Allergy testing or making a switch to a hypoallergenic diet may be recommended. If testing does not identify the cause of your cat’s hair loss, glucocorticoids like prednisolone may be prescribed. Diagnosing this condition can be challenging, as both self-inflicted trauma and stress can lead to physical symptoms. However, a primary behavioral cause is more likely if there is a minimal response to treatment with no significant findings from these tests. Treatment The treatment plan for this type of hair loss centers around treating the underlying medical conditions present and meeting the basic needs of your cat, which includes environmental modifications. Known as The5 Pillars of a Healthy Feline Environmentby Sarah Ellis et al., a list of basic needs was published in theJournal of Feline Medicine and Surgery.These include: Positive reinforcement training can provide social andmental enrichment,improving communication between you and your cat. It also helps in teaching behaviors that can redirect your cat from overgrooming to different activities, reducing overall stress levels. Punishment, such as yelling, physical punishment, or spraying your cat with water, is never recommended. If specific stressors are found, behavior modification can be employed to help your cat develop positive associations with whatever is causing them distress. Medical Therapy for Psychogenic Alopecia Behavioral medications can be helpful in some cases and include: Monitoring and Prognosis for Psychogenic Alopecia After the self-trauma has stopped and the hair has regrown, you may be able to slowly discontinue behavioral medications while watching your cat to make sure the same behaviors do not start all over again. Be sure to consult with your cat’s veterinarian before discontinuing any medications. Your cat’s long-term prognosis depends on what the underlying cause is for the behavior. Some cats may need medications for a long time, or even for life, while others may not. With psychogenic alopecia, some cases are easier to treat than others; effective methods may be identified early on, while some behaviors may never completely disappear. Much depends on the extent to which you can address your cat's source of stress and how well secondary skin infections caused by the trauma of overgrooming can be managed.

Category: Puppies and Kittens Who Bite
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bringing home a new puppy or kitten can be a fun and exciting experience. However, the learning and development process for puppies and kittens can be challenging. Biting is a common issue for young pets and needs to be addressed properly. Why Do Puppies and Kittens Bite? Biting, in which a dog or cat actively and purposefully bites down with their teeth (although not necessarily to break skin) is a common behavior in puppies and kittens. Mouthing, which is a general term for dogs or cats that put their mouths/teeth on people and other pets, sometimes in a chewing manner, sometimes in a nipping manner, is also common in puppies and kittens and tends to occur for the same reasons as biting. Biting and mouthing are normal behaviors in young, developing dogs and cats and are rarely associated with aggression. Reasons for biting include: Consequences of Biting Biting and mouthing may be normal for puppies and kittens, but continuing to bite into adulthood can lead to issues. Normally, young animals learn to stop biting during play when their mother and siblings correct them with yelps or distancing themselves. When siblings and parents are not available to teach a little one how to behave in the family, human owners must step in. Long-term consequences of biting vary depending on the cause. For example, biting out of fear, frustration, or to avoid something can teach bad habits if not prevented. When biting achieves the desired result of getting a human to stop an action (such as biting while having nails trimmed), the youngster could potentially learn that biting to get what he wants as an adult is acceptable. The same goes for biting because of attention seeking. If a puppy or kitten is mouthy as a means to get you to play with them and give them attention, rewarding this behavior with any kind of attention (to some pets, even corrections are attention) could mean continued mouthing or attention seeking behaviors as an adult. Even mouthing because of teething can lead to bad habits and continued mouthing well beyond the onset of adult teeth if not corrected. Regardless of why a youngster bites, biting should never be encouraged because it can lead to continued biting into adulthood, and as adults dogs and cats that bite can inflict serious damage and/or result in a poorer quality of life for themselves and their owners. How to Manage Biting Below are some suggestions for discouraging and preventing biting and mouthing. Remember that this is a learning process for everyone and that some suggestions will not be as effective as others depending on the reason for biting, such as play biting vs fear/avoidance. Punishment for Biting Donotpunish a puppy or kitten for biting. Punishment, especially for a normal behavior, can prevent a puppy or kitten from learning normal skills like play biting to hone hunting skills. It can also affect the bond between the pet and humans and may even lead to fear, aggression, and/or anxiety.Punishment does not serve to teach an appropriate behavior.The best solution is to stay consistent with your training methods and be patient. Use management tools that encourage better actions and provide good outlets to meet the needs of both you and your young pet.

Category: Territorial Marking in Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Territorial Marking? Territorial marking, also known as urine marking or spraying in cats, is the act of purposefully urinating in an area as a way of communicating. This behavior is normal in cats and used commonly in the wild or in outdoor settings. Generally, these ‘messages’ are used to avoid unnecessary or unexpected meetings, e.g., “Welcome to this tree. A cat named Fluffy lives here.” Urine marking can also convey readiness to mate or provide a sense of safety and/or security to the marking cat. It is important to understand that messages communicated in this manner are often not meant to be aggressive, intimidating or done spitefully. While humans may find urine puddles inappropriate, frustrating, or even rude, cats that find urine left by another cat typically will sniff casually and meander away, message received. How does Territorial Marking Differ from other Types of Inappropriate Elimination? Inappropriate elimination, also known as feline house soiling, is a term used for cats who urinate and/or defecate anywhere outside of the litterbox. Territorial marking is considered a type of inappropriate elimination and differs from other types by what causes it. Inappropriate elimination can be due to medical issues, such asarthritis,kidney failure, orurinary tract infections. It can also be due to household stress on the cat. While territorial marking can be related to stress, marking is more purposeful and is only rarely associated with underlying illness or disease. Why do Cats Mark? Most scientific studies about territorial marking have determined it is most often associated with social/relationship problems between cats within or outside the household, such as social standing amongst inter-household cats or seeing new cats outside the window. In addition to this, marking can be associated with sexual attraction. As noted, cats sometimes mark as a reaction to stress or environmental changes. Usually, urine marking associated with these factors is done in an area that is conspicuous, not hidden, and may also occur on or near the pet owner’s possessions, such as the laundry or bed. Cats that are marking typically prefer to urinate on vertical surfaces like the dishwasher as opposed to flat surfaces like rugs, although this is not always the case. Marking due to reactionary causes or social problems is often used to create a sense of security in the marking cat and it’s not meant to be a display of frustration or a spiteful maneuver; it is not meant to punish the human. The cat feels anxiety about new changes or issues and is trying to surround himself with his own scent to provide a stronger feeling of security and confidence. A Cat’s Territory Cats break their home down into two areas: their core territory, where they eat, sleep and play; and then a broader area known as their hunting range. This is true for indoor cats too, even if they don’t actually hunt. Indoor cats still have that instinctive desire for roaming their hunting range. In order to prevent a lot of territorial marking behaviors, the core territory of each individual cat needs to be protected and nurtured by the cat’s owner, especially in a household with multiple pets. This includes providing adequate sleeping spaces, bathroom areas, food and water, and play time. Have your Cat Checked Out Medically Have your cat checked out by your veterinarian. Make sure there aren’t any medical problems that could cause the behavior and confirm that urine marking is really what’s happening. Things your veterinarian may want to know include: Suggestions to Prevent Urine Marking Once your vet has established the diagnosis of territorial marking, recommendations can be provided, such as: Remember that territorial marking is a natural behavior in cats, and that they are not doing it to spite you. Think of the world in their terms and find a way to give every cat what that cat wants. Your veterinarian is a good resource for any outside-the-box issues.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cats retain many behaviors of their wild ancestors. As predators, they have strength, agility, speed, and keen senses to catch prey effectively. Owners can help their feline friends express these natural skills during mealtimes. Food enrichment provides physical and behavioral well-being for the cat and enjoyment for the family. Use the following tools to feed part of the daily meal or special treats. Many diets, including prescription diets, can be enhanced with wet or dry foods. Wet food can be smeared since cats lick up their meals Dry food can be placed in puzzles that cats bat, push, and move about to get the food to fall out Hide and seek because cats use the sense of smell to find food Interactive games build a better bond Safety Tips Supervise pet interactions when using these in a multi-pet household. Observe your cat during food enrichment to be sure they don’t get stuck, injured, or become frustrated. Small meals in feeders prevent gulping and may lessen vomiting.

Category: Cat Body Language
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the best things you can do to strengthen your relationship with your cat is to understand their body language. People communicate mainly in writing or speaking while cats use their body and sense of smell and touch.  By understanding their language, we can improve our relationship with them and interpret relationships between cats within our home. By observing your cat, you will see differences in body language by the positions of their body, tail, ears and eyes. The signals of all these body parts combine to give us a clear idea of what they are trying to say.  Sometimes fearful cat body language, such as closing their eyes, hunching close to the ground and tucking their tail around them, may be an indication of pain. You should discuss any signs of anxiety, stress, or pain with your veterinarian.

Category: Body Language of Cats
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cats use body language to communicate a variety of information and emotions to others. The primary body parts they use to convey their state of mind are their ears, tail, eyes, body posture, and vocal cords. Types of emotions and behaviors that can be demonstrated are fear or anxiety, frustration, pain, play, mating, contentedness or relaxation, and curiosity. Often body language can be used to display multiple emotions. Thus, when trying to figure out your cat’s body language, try to understand the context in which he is communicating. Fear/Anxiety Avoidance These types of behaviors are an effort to maintain safety from a perceived threat by avoiding the threat. Fear/Anxiety Repulsion These types of behaviors are an effort to maintain safety from a perceived threat by getting rid of it. Fear/Anxiety/Curiosity These information-gathering behaviors are an effort to learn about an object, person, environment, and/or if perceived as a threat, to determine the severity. Frustration These types of behaviors are reactions to something that is not meeting the cat’s expectations or their inability to control something (e.g., hunger, not wanting to be held). These behaviors are an effort to achieve what they desire. Pain It is extremely difficult to notice pain in cats as they tend to hide pain well, but they do demonstrate some noticeable behaviors. Play These behaviors are used during play and to initiate it. Hunting behaviors are similar to those of play. Relaxed/Content These show the cat is content and often demonstrates trust in their environment. Mating These are an effort to demonstrate receptiveness to mating, such as showing signs of going into heat or estrus. Behavior changes in cats can be quite subtle and difficult to notice unless you are really paying attention.

Category: Cats and High Places: Keeping Them off Counters and Tables
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Last week, I had an inquiry from a recent shelter cat adopter. This new adopter wanted to know how she could keep her new cat, Chowder, off countertops and the table. It seems whenever they prepare food or eat, Chowder is right there waiting for his fair share. Since this behavior started, they have tried several methods to deter him from jumping up, including yelling at him, placing him back on the floor, and recently started using a squirt bottle to keep him off. None of their techniques are working and they are quickly becoming frustrated. Why do cats often find counters and tables so appealing? What does not help? Using water bottles to spray your cat, yelling “no”, and placing them back on the floor will probably not change this behavior. In some cases, it might make the behavior more persistent. Some cats may become anxious, because from their perspective, your behavior is suddenly unpredictable and alarming. Often, the only thing these cats are learning from these strategies is to stay away from the “punisher”, who in this case is you! What can be done to reduce this behavior? Step 1: Determine why your cat is getting on the counter in the first place. Are they trying to get away from something in the home? Another cat? The dogs? A person? Are they window watching for birds, other cats, or just outside activity in general? Are they sunbathing? Only sitting on the counter when the sun is there? Are they searching for delicious tidbits of food? Do they like to drink or play with the water in the sink? Are there interesting “toys” left on the counter such as forks, spoons, lids, paper, hair ties, pencils, sponges, etc.? Once the “why” is determined, prevention and management can be put into place. Step 2: Avoid Reinforcing or encouraging the behavior. Make sure food is never left on the counter or table at any time, not even a morsel. Any little crumb will reinforce the behavior making the behavior harder to change. It is also important that you do not leave water in the sink or the water running so your cat is not encouraged to investigate the sink. Keeping your counters clean and tidy can be very difficult, especially if you live in a very small place or you have other family members that might not be as tidy as you would like. However, making sure the other “toys” are unavailable will prevent your cat from looking in these spaces for things to play with. You can also make the counters less appealing for your cat. Closing the curtains or blinds in the kitchen window will remove the lure of the sun for those sunbathers, encouraging them to seek the other locations. In general, cats are not a fan of citrus and various other strong-smelling disinfectants. Cleaning your countertop and table with a citrus cleaner can reduce the appeal for some cats. Make sure the counter is dry immediately after wiping so there are no opportunities for your cat to ingest these cleaners or get them on their feet or fur. Placing a carpet runner upside down on your countertop or table creates an unpleasant texture that cats will try to avoid. Step 3: Provide alternative places for your cat to use. If your cat is trying to get away from something in the house, provide other safe places for your cat. Cat trees, shelving, chairs, or even another table nearby with a box and cat bed in it can create a safe place for your cat to retreat. If your cat is a window watcher or sunbather creating a perch in another window is a simple solution. Cats that are trying to escape to higher ground might need help learning that the cat tree, boxes, or shelving is safe. Be sure to place treats in the new location so your cat explores the alternative places on their own. In addition, when the thing they are trying to avoid is approaching them call them to the new location, and give them treats. Placing a bird feeder outside the window where the perch or cat tree is located is a sure way to keep your cat entertained. Using perches in several windows will allow the sunbathers to move from window to window. If your cat likes to get on the counters when you are preparing food and eating, give them something else to do like a food dispensing or puzzle toy. The website Food Puzzles for Cats is an excellent resource to find the perfect toys for your cat. Place treats in the locations you want your cat to go, such as the other window perches, on the cat tree, in the box on the chair, so they are rewarded for searching the new spots but there are no rewards for your cat on the kitchen counter or table. Make sure your cat has a variety of toys similar to the ones that attract them to the countertops to play. Scatter the toys on the floor near the counters or tables. If you consistently keep the counter and table clean and provide toys on the floor, your cat will learn that the counters are no longer worth investigating because all of the fun stuff is on the floor. If your cat is drawn to running water to drink or play in, consider using a cat water fountain. Step 4: Train your cat. Yes, cats can be trained. Use positive reinforcement to teach your cat behaviors such as coming when called, targeting or touch, fetch, and go to a place or mat, which is also called stationing. These simple behaviors not only help to improve the bond you have with your cat but provide clear communication and an opportunity to reward them for the behaviors you want them to do more often.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Elimination disorders are one of the most frustrating behaviors that cat owners encounter and a leading reason for cats to be surrendered to shelters or euthanized. Although elimination is a normal communicative behavior for cats and can serve a specific purpose, people might find the location(s) unacceptable. When your cat is eliminating outside the box, it is important to have all potential medical causes for the behavior ruled out with a physical examination by your veterinarian and the necessary diagnostics. Once medical conditions are ruled out, elimination disorders can then be broken down into two main categories: Inappropriate elimination (toileting) or marking (spraying). A complete history including litter type, litter box size, the cleanliness of the box, and social relationship between the cats can help to determine why your cat is choosing to eliminate outside the box. Physical exam Findings in Cats Displaying Problems Common Medical Causes of Inappropriate Elimination (Toileting) Inappropriate Elimination (Toileting) Cleanliness of the box is often the number one reason that cats will choose other locations to eliminate. Location, litter type, litter box size, and type of box are important factors to evaluate when determining a cause. The litterbox should be scooped at least daily and the litter changed every one to two weeks. When cleaning the box, only soap and water should be used since most cats will find citrus scented products unpleasant. Current research shows that the most important factor when choosing a box is size and not necessarily whether it is covered or not. Most commercial litter boxes are too small for the average cat and creating a litter box out of a plastic storage container or a sweater box may be a better choice. Most cats do not like automatic litter boxes or litter box liners. Cats with an aversion to the litterbox will often avoid the box completely, fail to dig in the box, or cover their elimination. Many will straddle the box, shake their feet excessively after leaving the box, or eliminate near but not in the box. If it is a substrate aversion, they will show a preference for a particular substrate such as carpet, tile, or piece of furniture. These cats will often choose a closet or secluded area of the house and often have a medical reason that initially causes elimination to occur outside of the box although the behavior continues after the primary condition resolves. Treatment for inappropriate elimination involves offering a variety of boxes with litter choices, including a litterbox cafeteria. Most cats prefer cheap, clumping, non-scented litter. Placing a different type of litter in each box at varying depths next to each other is a way to monitor which litter and depth each cat prefers for elimination. A rug box that consists of an empty box with a throw rug (washable soft material) is helpful for cats with a carpet or cloth substrate preference. Cats often prefer to eliminate within the confines of the box vs. out in the open, reducing elimination on the carpet. Clean the areas where the cat has been eliminating with an enzyme-based cleaner. Injecting the cleaner into carpet pads, furniture seams, wall seams, and behind baseboards will help to clean all areas. Place deterrents in previously soiled areas, such as an upside-down carpet runner with heavily perfumed soaps spread on top for a deterrent. Change the value of the area by turning it into a feeding station or preventing access to the area altogether by using gates and closing doors.  Usually horizontal surfaces Squatting position Large amount of urine or feces Eliminates near but not in the box Vertical surfaces (walls, drapes, furniture) Most stand but some will squat Small amounts of urine Will still use the box for most elimination Marking Marking is a common behavior found in unneutered males but can also occur in neutered males and a small percentage of spayed females. Cats often mark for two main reasons: one is to signal territory and the other to reduce anxiety. Most marking does not have an underlying medical cause and usually indicates a social anxiety among cats in the household or a view of other cats outside windows. Treatment for marking involves identifying the underlying social tension by observing communication signals of all cats in the household. Overtly aggressive or “bully” cats will stalk, pounce, growl, and attack the victim cat. The victim cat will actively avoid the bully cat. They may leave the room as soon as the other cat enters or walk the perimeter rather than through the center of the room. You may often find this cat up high on surfaces, or hiding under the bed or behind furniture. Cats that are aroused by outdoor cats may suddenly become aggressive to other cats or people in the household after encountering another cat outside the window or door. These cats can stay in an aroused state for hours to weeks and should be carefully separated until they have time to settle down. When there are multiple cats in the household, make sure there are plenty of resources for all of them: litter boxes, feeding stations, vertical spaces, sleeping stations, hiding areas, and water bowls. Punishment is often ineffective and confusing for cats who and reward-based training helps to provide mental stimulation and positive human interactions. Scheduling 20-30 minutes of playtime a day along with 5-10 minutes of positive reinforcement training time daily is ideal. Cats can be taught basic behaviors such as “sit”, “come”, “mat” and targeting or “touch.” All provide clear communication and can be used for redirection if confrontation occurs with another household cat. These behaviors, along with play, can help to change emotional responses to another cat, person, or animal in the household during the behavior modification process. Behavioral History The use of food dispensing and puzzle toys add mental stimulation and enrichment bysimulating hunting behavior. Outdoor access in the form of walks on a harness or in an enclosure can provide physical exercise and mental stimulation. Cats with litter box aversions or substrate preferences do not necessarily need medications. Once the cause is identified and the hygiene of the box improved, the cat often returns to using the box. Marking in cats often responds well to serotonin enhancing medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and clomipramine (Clomicalm). Pheromones can be useful in the forms of sprays and diffusers. Therapeutic diets available at your veterinary clinic may be useful. These diets contain milk protein and L-theanine which can also be found in supplements such as Zylkene (Vetoquinol), Anxitane (Virbac), and Solliquin (Nutramax), which in some studies have shown to increase calmness and relaxation. Work with your veterinarian or a veterinary behaviorist if your cat continues to have problems with inappropriate elimination or marking indoors.

Category: Inappropriate Elimination
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English House-training problems - called inappropriate elimination - are the number one cause of behavior-related complaints from cat lovers, and with good reason. No one likes to deal with urine and feces in a litter box, much less in a part of the house you didn't expect to find them. Cats who can't be convinced to use the litter box all too often end up looking for a new home, and for these animals the prognosis is grim. Fortunately, most cases of inappropriate elimination can be solved if you're determined to look at things from your cat's point of view, make a few adjustments, and stay patient. Although you still need to fix the underlying problems of why your cat isn't going where he should, some medications may help in the short run. Talk to your veterinarian. Litter-box avoidance The first step in getting your cat to use the litter box is to figure out why he's not using it. You will need to have your veterinarian help to rule out a medical problem, such as diabetes or kidney disease; if your cat is young, the most common medical cause of a "sense of urgency" isfeline idiopathic cystitisand, less commonly, bladder stones or urinary tract infections.  These infections give the cat a "sense of urgency" to urinate even when the bladder is not full; and urinating may even be downright painful in more severe cases. Your cat may come to associate the use of the box with these unpleasant sensations, and so avoids the box. If that's the case, you need to retrain your cat, perhaps by changing the box and litter so it "feels" different, but probably by using the safe room approach. (More on that in this section.) If your cat checks out fine, you need to experiment to make sure that everything about the box is to his liking. The following list describes some things to consider: Make the area where you cat has had mistakes less attractive by cleaning thoroughly with a pet-odor neutralizer (available in pet-supply stores or catalogs) and covering with foil, plastic sheeting, or plastic carpet runners with the points up to discourage reuse of the area. Enzymatic pet-mess cleaners take time to work, so figure on keeping the area blocked off for at least a couple of weeks. If this procedure doesn't clear up the problem, you may need to retrain your cat by keeping him in a small area for a few days. Make sure that the safe room has no good options besides the litter box - no carpet, no pile of dirty laundry. Block off the bathtub; keep an inch of water in it to discourage its use as a place to go. After your cat is reliably using the litter box, let him slowly expand his territory again. As long as you keep up your end of the bargain and keep the litter box appealing, he should keep his up, too.

Category: Understanding your Cat’s Body Language
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cats use body language to communicate a variety of information and emotions to others. To convey their state of mind, they mostly use their ears, tail, eyes, body posture, and vocal cords. Types of emotions and behaviors that can be demonstrated are fear or anxiety, frustration, pain, play, mating, contentedness or relaxation, and curiosity. Often body language can be used to display multiple emotions. Thus, when trying to figure out your cat’s body language, try to understand the context in which he is communicating. Body Language and Behaviors Fear/Anxiety AvoidanceThese types of behaviors are an effort to maintain safety from a perceived threat by avoiding the threat.freezing (in an effort to be less noticeable), especially if confined or unable to escape; such cats are often quiet and do not vocalize or make noise. Note that a “frozen” cat can switch quickly to “repulsion,” becoming aggressive towards the cause of fear Fear/Anxiety RepulsionThese types of behaviors are an effort to maintain safety from a perceived threat by getting rid of it. Fear/Anxiety/CuriosityThese information-gathering behaviors are an effort to learn about an object, person, environment, and/or if perceived as a threat, to determine the severity. FrustrationThese types of behaviors are reactions to something that is not meeting the cat’s expectations or their inability to control something (e.g., hunger, not wanting to be held). These behaviors are an effort to achieve what they desire. PainIt is extremely difficult to notice pain in cats as they tend to hide pain well, but they do demonstrate some noticeable behaviors. PlayThese behaviors are used during play and to initiate it. Hunting behaviors are similar to those of play. Relaxed/ContentThese show the cat is content and often demonstrates trust in their environment. MatingThese are an effort to demonstrate receptiveness to mating, such as showing signs of going into heat or estrus. Behavior changes in cats can be quite subtle and difficult to notice unless you are really paying attention. To learn more, see achart of cat body languagefrom Dr. Sophia Yin.

Category: How to Make Veterinary Visits Less Stressful
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Experiencing some fear during veterinary visits is a normal reaction for pets. It’s not fun to be examined by strangers and poked with needles. Pets do not understand why they are there or that the uncomfortable procedures will benefit their health. Fear during clinic visits often leads to patient distress, discomfort, and behavior problems. If their fear and anxiety are not addressed effectively, it can worsen over time, become harder to manage safely, and can have negative impacts on their welfare. Fear and emotional distress create challenges that can prevent pets from receiving necessary care. Fear can put people at risk. You may be hesitant to take your pet in just to avoid the experience; some people are embarrassed by their pet’s behavior. Remember they are behaving this way because they are afraid, not because they are bad or trying to embarrass you. There are several ways to reduce fear and to provide a low-stress experience. Creating that experience is a team effort between you and staff. Body Language Reading pet body language appropriately is the key to less stress. Handling can then be adjusted based on what the pet’s body language is saying. If the early signs of stress are ignored your pet’s behavior may escalate. Since animals learn from experience, they may skip the earlier signs entirely at the next visit, intensifying to more aggressive behaviors. Preparation You know your pet better than anyone else. Discuss any behavioral concerns when scheduling the appointment so the medical staff will be better prepared for your pet’s visit.Preparation also includes making transportation comfortable. For example, cats can learn how to be more comfortable entering and riding in their carriers. Carriers with tops that are easily removed are best. Pheromones can sometimes help to reduce anxiety in the car or anti-anxiety medications may be needed. Make sure to wait until your car is at an appropriate temperature before bringing your pet to the car. Calming music, such as classical, can help block out road noise. Happy Visits If your dog is fearful, “happy visits” can help them feel more comfortable at the hospital. Stop by for a quick visit that involves positive interaction. Staff can briefly interact, say comforting things, and give your pet treats to improve their perception of the clinic. What to Look for at the Clinic Using Treats at the Clinic Bring your pet’s favorite treats. While waiting and during the exam, frozen Kong treats or lick mats can help form positive associations with the hospital. Giving treats to a fearful pet will not reinforce fear. If your pet stops eating, then their anxiety and stress level is escalating. This may be the time to stop the exam although some respond to a different type of treat. In the Exam Room Examining dogs on the floor and cats in their carrier, on a countertop, or in a lap is usually less stressful. Bring a non-slip mat from home. Many dogs and cats do better if they can stay with you during the exam. Cats should never be dumped or pulled out of their carrier. Open the door and allow your pet to explore the room on their own. If your pet will not come out within a few minutes, take the carrier apart so they can stay in the bottom. Placing a towel over their body can help them feel more secure. Cats should not be scruffed during handling. A safer, more compassionate way to handle cats is using towel wraps. Basket muzzles are ideal for dogs if they have been conditioned to wear them comfortably. Always consider whether the planned procedures need to be completed that day or can wait. If your pet’s stress level is escalating, discontinuation of the exam or procedure may be necessary. If the visit cannot wait ask about taking a break or trying alternative approaches, such as sedation. At the end of this appointment, discuss your pet’s behavior and what could help next time. Your veterinarian may prescribe anti-anxiety medications for the next visit. Some pets may do better with a mobile veterinarian who provides services in the comfort of your own home. Working with a veterinary behaviorist or a qualified behavior professional may be needed.

Category: How to Prepare Your Cat for a Low Stress Handling® Blood Draw Visit
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Tabitha Kucera RVT, CCBC, KPA-CTP Veterinary visits can be stressful for everyone, especially cats. Using the “less-is-more” approach, Low Stress Handling® Principles of Handling provides an opportunity for you to help your veterinarian perform a safer and more thorough physical exam along with any necessary diagnostics (blood draws, radiographs, ultrasound) needed to diagnose and treat your cat appropriately. These Principals of Handling include: Greetings • Avoid staring and direct approach.• Move calmly and speak in quiet tones.• Do not invade personal space. Always invite your cat into your space.• Use distractions and rewards like food, brushing, and play. The Carrier • Carry the carrier from the bottom, not the handle: This allows your cat to feel more stable and minimizes back and forth movement, which reduces nausea and discomfort while also decreasing the risk of the carrier breaking and your cat getting loose.• Cover the carrier with apheromone-infused towel.• Always elevate the carrier off the floor in the waiting room.• Place the carrier on the table or floor in the exam room.• Do not dump, tip, or shake the carrier.• Open the door and allow an opportunity for your cat to exit on their own.• Use treats and/or toys to lure the cat out of the carrier.• If your cat does not come out of the carrier on their own, remove the lid before gently lifting your cat out of the carrier. Comfortable Environment • Perform the examination where your cat is most comfortable (owner’s lap, cat carrier).• Have everything already in the room needed for the visit (blood collection kit, vaccinations, equipment for examination, etc.) before starting.• Do not continually enter and exit the room.• Be mindful of sights, smells, and sounds (i.e., avoid barking dogs) that may cause distress. Use Appropriate or Minimal Restraint • Always support your cat well and have your hands, arms, and body positioned appropriately so your cat will not feel as if they will fall or are off-balance.• Adjust your handling based on each cat and their individual response to restraint.• Be mindful of painful joints and temperature changes (i.e., cold stainless-steel tables)• Avoid prolonged struggling. More than 1-2 seconds or repeated handling adjustments, consider pre-visit medications or sedation depending on what “needs” to be done that day.• Avoid unnatural, uncomfortable, or painful positions when possible.• Do not reposition the cat by pulling on legs, ears, tail, skin, or fur. Body Language • Assess body language and adjust handling techniques based on the animal’s individual preference.• Assess yourself. Our behavior and body language affect the patient’s emotional state.• Less is often more. Towel restraint • There are 6 different types oftowel wraps.• Each towel restraint method requires practice and patience before use.• Different wraps can be used for various procedures including blood collection, subcutaneous fluid administration, catheter placement, and injections. Thoughtful changes in the hospital set-up along with a more individualized handling and restraint plan can go a long way in providing a more positive experience at the veterinary hospital for both you and your cat.

Category: Introducing the New Baby to Your Cat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bringing home a new baby often requires a good bit of preparation within the household. One aspect of this is figuring out how to introduce your cat to your new baby and transitioning him to all the new changes that will come with your future bundle of joy. Of course, some cats interact really well with new babies and will continue their lives as if nothing has changed. For many cats, however, changes associated with a new baby in the house can be a difficult adjustment and may result in stress or anxiety. This can lead to some unwanted behaviors such as crying or meowing more frequently, displays of aggression,urinating outside of the litterbox, and/or changes in their grooming habits. How to Prepare Ideally, any changes you plan to make need to be done slowly, and months in advance of the baby’s arrival. This should include changes to your cat’s feeding and play times as well as transitioning him to other areas of the house if necessary. Cats are notoriously creatures of habit and struggle with abrupt changes in their schedules. Getting your cat used to changes before the baby comes home will help to cut down on your cat’s stress levels as well as yours. Always remember to keep things positive and relaxed during this transition time. Get your cat up to date on his vaccines and make sure he has a good physical examination. Issues such as arthritis pain may decrease your cat’s tolerance to new adjustments or changes and should be under control if at all possible before you bring the new baby home. Teach your cat new ways to play and exercise so interacting is easier when you are busy or have your hands full. Solo play opportunities include using cat tunnels, crinkly bags, or boxes. You could randomly hide treats or catnip inside these play areas to further entice your cat to hunt for fun on his own. Set up new scratching posts in different areas of your home. Install a bird feeder outside one of his favorite windows and provide a comfortable place for him to keep watch. Use dangling toys, toys on a string, or a basket full of crumpled paper or jingly balls that you can easily reach while engaged with the baby. This may also help encourage your cat to enjoy spending time around the baby, because it will mean he can spend time playing with you too. Relocating Your Cat to Other Areas of the House If your primary concern for relocating your cat is to prevent him from getting into the baby’s crib, crib tents can be used for this purpose; they look a little like mosquito nets. The old wives’ tale that cats will steal a baby’s breath is completely untrue, but concerns could potentially arise if your large cat wants to snuggle with your tiny newborn in his or her crib. Avoid restricting your cat from a large area of the household. It is common for soon-to-be parents to want to keep their cat out of the baby’s room or the baby’s space. This can sometimes lead to trouble if the baby’s space takes over a large portion of the house (e.g., your bedroom, the kitchen, the living room, etc.) because parents may fully restrict the cat to a back bedroom or bathroom. Your home is also your cat’s home, so you will likely be setting yourself up for some unwanted behavior responses. Some division is possible when necessary with a little creativity. For example, using a screen door instead of a solid door for the baby’s room can keep your cat out but still allow air circulation and sound to travel. New beds in quiet areas of the house may entice your cat to relocate on his own. Be sure the area you are transitioning him to is a place he will enjoy. You may want to offer several options throughout the house and let him choose his new favorite area. Offer lots of treats, rewards, and/or praise to encourage your cat to be comfortable in his new space. Pheromone diffusers, such as Feliway, placed in or near his new space can help reduce his anxiety. You may also want to consider providing a new litterbox near this area in case accessing the old box is more difficult. You will not necessarily need two boxes permanently, but it is important to avoid abruptly changing your cat’s bathroom area. If you don’t have much space available for transitioning, go vertical: somewhere the baby can’t go or access. Perches, cat climbing towers, or sturdy shelves can provide your cat with a new space and prevent him from being stuck in a room he does not prefer or a place where he will not feel safe. After the Baby Arrives Try to maintain the same level of activity and interaction with your cat that you developed prior to the baby’s arrival. This will be difficult with a new baby and new responsibilities but is necessary to help minimize your cat’s anxiety and/or frustration. Don’t forget to change the litterbox regularly and to maintain a consistent feeding schedule. When the baby and cat are together, it will be important to supervise their interactions. Stay calm during interactions and reward all positive behaviors from your cat (e.g., treats, petting, playing). If your cat seems fearful, do not force him to spend more time with the baby. Allow him his space so that he can learn to cohabitate comfortably with your new addition. Remember to consult with your veterinarian if any questions or concerns arise. He or she may be able to offer suggestions or help if introductions or the transitioning period are not going well.

Translating Return to English Katharine Schwarz, RVT, KPA CTP Since indoor cats rarely leave the house, they often become stressed or anxious when they are taken to the veterinary hospital once a year. Cats learn by association, so the sudden appearance of the carrier tends to signal that something scary is happening.

Category: Importance of Socializing Puppies and Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Socialization? The word socialization is a bit misleading when taken literally. Socialization sounds like teaching a puppy or kitten how to socialize with other puppies or kittens. While these kinds of interactions help them learn to act like a normal dog or cat, this is only part of what socialization means and why it is important.  It’s much more than learning how to interact with other animals of the same species. Domestic dogs and cats don’t live in the wild and need to take their cues from more than just their pack mates. Socialization is getting puppies and kittens used to people, other animals, and experiences that they will encounter frequently in their adult lives. More than just conforming to dog and cat norms, it’s learning to accept everything around them, such as people, car rides, grooming, vacuum cleaners, noises, other animals, and other household pets. This involves gently exposing puppies and kittens to new things that they will deal with regularly as adults so that they can react confidently and appropriately rather than fearfully or with anxiety. Socialization is especially important for orphans because they received little if any interaction with their mother and family, and may have no basis at all for how to act around others. Breed, health, and personality also play a factor in the way a pet behaves with others, even if properly socialized. Some dogs and cats are not as outgoing or social as others and do not enjoy spending time with big groups of people or animals. Socialization is not necessarily about teaching them to want these interactions, but more about teaching them how to handle themselves and communicate appropriately within their environments. When to Socialize Developmentally, the best time for socialization is between 3-14 weeks of age in puppies and 3-9 weeks in kittens. During this period growth, they form relationships and attachments easily. Their senses are more developed, they are more independent, and they are physically capable enough to interact with others. Start socialization efforts as early as possible within this time period to maximize their benefits. During this key socialization period, any experiences that occur will have long-lasting effects on a puppy’s or kitten’s future learning and interactions with others. Unfortunately, that means negative experiences will also have lasting effects. It is critical that this time period be positive and safe. How to Socialize a Puppy or Kitten Remember that the purpose of socialization is to have the puppy or kitten interact with other people, animals, and things in order to be comfortable with the environment in which they live. When socializing, it is important to minimize discipline or training. Don’t try to reinforce commands or proper behaviors because that takes your pet’s attention away from the new experiences. It is also important to balance play with these learning experiences. Put your pet in situations that she may experience as an adult, such as car rides, being in a carrier, toys, grooming procedures, meeting other animals, meeting new people, and trips to the veterinarian. Introduce your puppy or kitten to new people, animals, and things in a nonthreatening manner, which means it’s not scary to the kitten or puppy. If your pet reacts with fear, you likely need to scale back the interaction to the level the puppy or kitten is comfortable. This could mean letting them watch instead of play, distracting them with treats, or moving them farther away from whatever they are afraid of until they become comfortable. Never punish a fearful puppy or kitten if they are anxious during interactions. This is an important time in their development and creating fearful situations will only lead to more problems in the future. It is also fine for a pet to not interact during these times as socialization is a time for watching and learning; just remember to keep things relaxed. Gently touch, hold or restrain, and physically interact with your pet every day. This is especially important at an early age because it helps your young pet become comfortable with humans and being handled, and it also helps to speed and enhance their physical and mental development. Puppies and kittens need to interact with non-family members (including children) so they get used to meeting and being around new people when they are adults. Handling your puppy or kitten should include gently touching the face, ears, and paws to make grooming and examinations easier. Restraining them means holding them in place gently and in a non-threatening manner so they can get used to being held and to promote calm demeanors for veterinary check-ups or grooming. Some veterinary behaviorists suggest that during the socialization period a puppy or kitten should meet 5 to 10 new people each week and that they should experience being in a new place at least once a week. They should be exposed to new sights, sounds, tastes, and smells. Keep things positive and non-threatening with treats, toys, and affection. What if my Puppy or Kitten Isn’t Fully Vaccinated? Spending time with healthy, fully vaccinated animals should be safe for your puppy or kitten. You can arrange play dates with animals you know are vaccinated. However, try to avoid exposing your pet to an unvaccinated animal, such as at the dog park. This is especially true with young animals because they are more vulnerable to infections than adults. Exposure to puppies and kittens who are not old enough to have received all their vaccines is considered by some to be a calculated risk. This means that while there is a risk for catching a disease, it may not be as much of a concern in the right setting. As an example, a study assessed the risk of infection for parvovirus in appropriately run puppy classes: puppies were otherwise healthy, the place was clean and sanitary, and all the puppies were up to date on vaccines for their age groups. Of 1,012 puppies studied, no increased risk for contracting parvovirus was found when compared with puppies not attending class. Consequences of Not Socializing Socializing puppies and kittens early within the socialization developmental period has been shown to decrease fear, aggression, and anxiety of new people, animals, or situations. Pets not properly socialized often have an increased sensitivity to new experiences. They are often fearful of people or other animals, even within their own species. This can result in avoiding people or other animals, anxious behaviors, or even hostility or violence towards others. Lack of socialization can also delay development and decrease the puppy’s or kitten’s ability to learn and make connections about social norms, including sleeping habits and where and when to find food. These issues can make it difficult for them to live easily with others and in some cases may lead to them being re-homed or sent to animal shelters. Giving your new puppy or kitten (or young animal of any species) significant socialization during that critical stage will pay off handsomely by helping your pet become a confident adult.

Category: Traveling with Your Cat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English At some point, you and your cat will need to travel. You may feel stressed by the idea, but with a bit of effort and planning, cats can learn to cope with the trip. Preparing your cat beforehand can make the experience less stressful for both of you. Preparation How much preparation is needed depends largely on how you are traveling and the length of time the trip will take. Know the requirements for traveling with your cat well in advance. Most transportation companies have guidelines for cat travel including approved carriers and health requirements. When flying, make sure that your cat will be in a temperature and pressure-controlled area. Extra caution is needed with breeds like Persians and Himalayans as flat-faced cats cannot handle temperature or pressure changes easily. If your cat has shown distress during past travels, be sure to talk with your veterinarian. If a health certificate is required, your cat will need a veterinary visit. Discuss the use of medications to help your cat feel more comfortable.  Have the appropriate carrier ready well in advance of your trip and start teaching your cat that thecarrieris a great place to be. For long car rides, consider using a large dog crate that can accommodate a small litter box along with space for your cat to rest comfortably. If you are flying or using any other public transportation, the size of the carrier will likely be limited. Use a pee pad to line the carrier in case of accidents. Cats who are accustomed to wearing a harness with a leash and are comfortable in public may be able to take breaks from the carrier during long trips. Be cautious even when your cat is used to wearing a harness or leash, as some cats may easily startle and try to escape. Acclimating to the Car If you are driving, you can acclimate your cat to the carrier as well as the car. Complete the following steps over multiple sessions while feeding your cat treats and watching their body language. Your cat should be more relaxed each session; if not, then stop and go back to the last most successful step.   During the Trip Allow plenty of travel time to avoid added stress for yourself and your cat.   Give your cat some time to adjust to the car before you start driving. Bring your cat’s breakfast with you to feed in small portions throughout the trip. Using tricks your cat knows, like "touch" or "paw", can help your cat focus on something they enjoy. After Arrival Your cat will need some time to feel comfortable in their new environment. Prepare a room or safe haven area for them so they can relax. Make sure they have everything they need in this space such as a litter box, hiding spot, scratching post, resting area, food and water. Wait to introduce your cat to any other pets in the home until after they have acclimated.

Category: What Is Cooperative Care in Veterinary Medicine?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Rachel Lees LVMT, KPA CTP, VTS (Behavior), FFCP (Veterinary) Animal behavior is a crucial aspect of veterinary care.  Whether your pet has pain or just “ain’t doing right,”  the pet’s behavior, body language, and overall demeanor is part of obtaining a thorough and precise physical examination.  Without this type of examination, symptoms and diagnoses may be missed that could make or break the treatment plans.  Without the ability to communicate, the pet may panic causing increased fear, stress, aggression, and anxiety that is associated with handling and restraint. When the veterinary staff is unable to successfully examine or handle a patient, it becomes a quality-of-life concern as the veterinary team cannot provide medical care. Observing behavior is an important part of every pet’s visit.  Staff should discuss behavioral concerns with you and give options for how they will make your pet’s visit as enjoyable as possible. Making Cooperative Care the Standard of Care for Each Patient Veterinary behavior professionals are often asked how veterinary staff can start using these techniques while keeping things straightforward.  Behavior medicine starts with opening the eyes of the veterinary team to “see” behavior.  Once you visualize a patient’s aggression as fear, stress, or anxiety, you cannot un-see it.  Implementing cooperative care techniques in practice is also a huge change for clinics.  Programs such as Low Stress Handling® and Fear Free® have created membership programs for individuals and teams to create a more behavior friendly atmosphere using special techniques such astowel wrapsand minimal restraint methods. You may notice food is often used during veterinary visits as a distractor. When using this method, it is important that the food be given just before the procedure begins. If your pet stops eating, then the team should stop and assess the emotional state of your pet. The goal is to make sure your pet always associates a positive experience with what’s happening. Sometimes other reinforcers are used such as play, scent, toys, petting, etc. depending on what your pet prefers. This method helps to prevent fear and anxiety but if your pet is already afraid at the clinic these distractors may not be enough. Cooperative care may be the next step needed to help your pet. Cooperative care provides your pet with an opportunity to opt in or out of a procedure, communicating their consent to treatment. An example of this would be teaching a dog to go to a mat for handling. In training sessions, the pet learns that when they move to their mat, handling will happen.  Therefore, if the dog chooses to go to the mat, they are giving consent to touching.  This teaches them that if they are uncomfortable, they can simply opt out by moving off the mat. They do not need to go to extremes such as biting to stop the handling. Another example is an offeredchin restto alloweye drops, ear cleaning, ornail trims. Cooperative care is not just limited to the veterinary clinic. Teaching your pet other behaviors to participate in husbandry procedures such as grooming,nail trims, topical monthlyflea treatments,eye medicating, etc. can also be done. A cat that voluntarily enters acarrieron cue is easier to take anywhere and less stressful for all. Learning how to prevent certain stressors at the clinic and at home will help your pet accept procedures.
