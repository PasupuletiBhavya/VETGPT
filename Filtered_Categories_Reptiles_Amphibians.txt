Category: AAFCO Pet Food Labeling
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pet food marketing can get confusing. The labeling does not provide detailed nutritional information and it’s easily misunderstood by consumers. Try as you might, sometimes reading the label doesn’t give you enough answers. However, the more you know about what pet food labels indicate – and don’t – the better off your pet will be. What is AAFCO? AAFCOis the go-to organization for understanding animal feed, including food for pets. It does not regulate or inspect anything, nor is it a government agency. It is a group whose members are government agencies representing the 50 states, Canada, and the federal government. It is not a regulatory body and has no ability to monitor or enforce specific food manufacturing procedures. Animal feed specialists indicate to them what is appropriate for a specific species, and AAFCO provides model feed laws. AAFCO does not approve or certify any pet food, treat, or supplement products. The FDA, not AAFCO, regulates pet food, and FDA is a member of AAFCO. State feed control officials can choose to adopt these model feed laws – if they do, then monitoring and enforcement duties are the responsibility of the individual state. Pet food manufacturers that sell food must comply with all relevant federal or state laws. Most pet foods sold in multiple states will comply with the AAFCO guidelines. AAFCO relies on current scientific knowledge to provide guidelines for pet food composition which, if followed,minimize the risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, the FDA enforces food safety through the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, which demands that pet foods, like human foods, be “pure and wholesome, safe to eat, produced under sanitary conditions, contain no harmful substances, and be truthfully labeled.” Therefore, pet food manufacturers are legally responsible for providing nutritionally adequate, safe, and wholesome products that conform to local, state, and federal law. AAFCO requires nine components to be printed on a pet food label:  What are the different AAFCO nutritional adequacy designations for pet foods? There are four possible AAFCO nutritional adequacy statements that can appear on pet food labels. These must be printed verbatim as one of the following: How are AAFCO feeding trials conducted? The guidelines for an AAFCO feeding trial vary depending on the diet type being evaluated. There are four protocols: maintenance, growth, gestation/lactation, and all life stages. Although the minimum standards for each type of trial must be met, companies may add on other components to a feeding trial, such as plasma amino acid measurement, digestibility studies, full blood chemistry panels, and complete blood counts to gain additional information about the suitability of their diets for the life stage being tested. Foods can be put through AAFCO feeding trials even if they do not qualify for a “formulated to meet AAFCO” feeding statement due to deficient or excessive levels of nutrients. One example is veterinary therapeutic diets formulated for chronic kidney disease, which are intentionally formulated to contain phosphorus (+/- protein) at concentrations below the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles for adult maintenance; many of these have passed maintenance feeding trials and thus have a “feeding trial” nutritional adequacy statement on the bag. If they have not undergone feeding trials, they must carry the statement: “This product is intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.” Such diets are not allowed to reference the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles on the label. Theoretically, the flip side is that diets that fail feeding trials but contain nutrient levels within the specified minimum and maximum concentrations per AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles can be marketed with a “formulated to meet” adequacy statement. Ideally, diets are formulated to comply with the concentrations specified by the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles and then pass appropriate feeding trials. Foradult maintenance canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Forgrowth canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Forreproduction canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Do AAFCO feeding trials accomplish what they claim to accomplish? Many pet owners and clinicians have raised the concern that AAFCO feeding trials do not represent what really happens in a pet’s life, i.e., that feeding a diet for six months is not the same as feeding a diet for 10 years. That is true. However, although AAFCO trials are imperfect, they do identify most serious acute and semi-acute nutritional deficiencies or excesses, and some minor ones. Furthermore, manufacturers are free to supplement the minimum protocol requirements with additional measures of nutritional adequacy. Also, consider that diets for growth, gestation/lactation, or all life stages get tested more rigorously compared to maintenance since the nutritional demands of those animals are greater. Evaluation of diets under AAFCO guidelines also includes an examination of the nutrient content of the diet being tested. The nutrient content can be determined either by testing a sample of the finished diet or by using the nutrient content of the individual ingredients in the food to calculate the diet composition. The latter is less desirable, since ingredients are naturally variable in nutrient content and because processing and nutrient interactions could alter bioavailability (how much can actually be absorbed and used by your pet's body) in the final diet. There is no requirement for either in vivo or laboratory testing of pet food products if the formulation method of substantiating nutritional adequacy is used. Some companies have performed other in vivo testing (in-vivo meaning taking place within a living thing) and even lifelong feeding trials to demonstrate that their diets provide complete and balanced nutrition for the expected feeding duration (i.e., “for life”). How can you identify the pet foods that have undergone “more rigorous” testing of their pet food, rather than just the AAFCO statement on the bag? Unfortunately, you can't. Even veterinarians can’t. The pet food label is really a legal document and is not designed to convey significant nutritional information. As much as some sources (such as internet ranking lists) would like it to be possible, you cannot evaluate 'quality' from the label, especially from ingredient lists. You need to consider the manufacturer (reputation, experience, investment in AAFCO trials and research, etc.), cost, availability, and how your pets are doing on various diets. Board-certified veterinary nutritionists in clinical practice are alerted to dietary issues with specific diets because of extensive interaction with clients, practitioners, and each other. Therefore, these specialists are often a reliable resource for determining which diets are causing disease problems. In addition, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Nutrition Toolkit developed by the WSAVA Global Nutrition Committee provides many useful nutrition resources includingRecommendations on Selecting Pet Foods. This document lists eight questions to help owners assess pet foods: Factors to consider about a brand: Things to look for on a pet food label: It is ideal for a manufacturer to have a qualified nutritionist as a full-time employee rather than just as a consultant. Dr. Cailin Heinze, a board-certified nutritionist, additionally prefers companies that perform testing above and beyond AAFCO trials, especially with veterinary therapeutic diets. Furthermore, Dr. Heinze looks for company longevity as a sign of a successful track record and is critical of “guerrilla marketing” in pet supply stores (aggressive, emotion-based strategies directly to consumers). Finally, she looks for companies willing to share full nutritional profiles (e.g. full or typical analysis) of their diets rather than just a guaranteed analysis, and provide updated information with regular batch testing. Understanding what’s best for your pet isn’t always easy. Oftentimes the only way to get a clear answer to your question is to telephone (not email) the manufacturer. However, the best chance for your pet’s good health is to begin with food bearing an AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement on its label.

Category: Avian Gastric Yeast
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Avian gastric yeast infection is a bird disease caused by a yeast,Macrorhabdus sp,that causes gastrointestinal problems. It is highly contagious and affects a variety of birds. An older name for it is megabacteria because of its size. The organism infects the bird’s stomach, and the infection destroys the ability of the bird’s stomach to properly digest and absorb nutrients from food. Avian Stomach Anatomy The avian stomach is quite unlike the human one and has two parts with a connector. The proventriculus digests food; the isthmus moves food between the proventriculus and the gizzard; and the gizzard grinds food for easier digestion. Food moves back and forth between the proventriculus and gizzard until it is fully digested and the nutrients are absorbed. Who gets Avian Gastric Yeast? This disease occurs in a wide range of birds, such as chickens, partridges, ostriches, turkeys, parrots, finches, and budgerigars. Being infected with avian gastric yeast does not always result in infection and subsequent disease. Signs Signs of avian gastric yeast infection and disease are nonspecific and can take on two forms:  acute and chronic. Diagnosis As avian gastric yeast is transmitted through the fecal to oral route, fresh fecal samples are used as a quick diagnostic tool. Fecal testsare not highly accurate as the organism is shed sporadically in droppings. A negative test does not rule out infection. Histology, a sample of the tissue, is the only definitive test for avian gastric yeast infection. An isthmus tissue sample is usually done after death because of the complication and risk of a surgical procedure. Treatment Treatment outcome varies depending on the severity of the clinical signs the bird is experiencing. Prevention There is no vaccine to prevent avian gastric yeast. The only way to prevent the infection from spreading is clearing it from your flock. Quarantine all new birds for 30 days before introducing them to the flock. A veterinary exam is a necessity for all new birds.

Category: Clostridium difficile Becoming more Common in North America
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What IsClostridium difficile? Some strains contain genes that allow them to produce toxins. It is the toxins, not the bacteria themselves, that make a person or an animal sick. They can form spores, which can survive for years in the environment and are resistant to many disinfectants. If ingested, the spores germinate and the bacteria begin to grow when they reach the intestine. How Common IsClostridium difficile? HumansIn developed countries,C. difficileis the leading cause of infectious hospital-associated diarrhea in adults and accounts for 15-25% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is becoming more common in North America. The most important risk factor forC. difficileinfection (CDI) is treatment with antibiotics. The antibiotics affect the normal “good” bacteria in the intestine, which sometimes allowsC. difficileto take over and grow faster. Old age, certain cancer treatments, long hospitalization, some acid-suppressants used to treat stomach ulcers, intestinal surgery, and some other procedures also increase the likelihood of CDI. A hyper-virulentC. difficilestrain (ribotype 027/NAP1) has emerged in North America, Europe, and Japan, and has been responsible for epidemics of severe illness in hospitalized patients. Recently, severe illness due to CDI has been reported in some healthy, non-hospitalized people as well. AnimalsA small percentage of healthy dogs and cats (0-4%) carryC. difficilein their intestine. But in puppies, kittens, animals in breeding colonies, and dogs that visit human hospitals, the percentage may be higher (up to 30%). The bacteria can also be found in other types of pets, but it is unknown how common this is. How Do Animals And People Become Infected WithC. difficile? Clostridium difficilelives in the intestine of people and animals. When the bacteria are passed into the stool, they form spores that can survive in the environment for a long time. The bacteria are transmitted when the spores are ingested. This typically happens when there is stool contamination on something a person touches, and then the person touches their nose or mouth. Contamination of food and water can also be a problem. It is unclear ifC. difficilecan be transmitted from pets to people. The types ofC. difficilefound in pets are often the same as those found in people, including the epidemic strain ribotype 027/NAP1. So it makes sense thatC. difficilecould potentially be transmitted between people and animals, but there is still no conclusive proof. For now, it is best to err on the side of caution and considerC. difficiletransmissible between pets and people until proven otherwise. What Happens If A Person Or Animal GetsClostridium difficileInfection (CDI)? HumansIn people, CDI (which is also sometimes calledC. difficile-associated disease, or CDAD) may cause no illness at all, or anywhere from very mild to very severe diarrhea. Additional complications can also occur, particularly in people who are already sick for another reason. In some cases, the disease can be fatal. AnimalsThe vast majority of dogs and cats that carryC. difficilein their intestine do not become ill. However, there does appear to be a link betweenC. difficileand diarrhea in dogs in some cases, and there is one report ofC. difficilepossibly causing diarrhea in two cats. In most of these cases the diarrhea is mild, and clinically appears the same as diarrhea due to other common causes. Occasionally, more severe illness and diarrhea may occur. How IsClostridium difficileInfection Diagnosed? In animals and people, CDI is diagnosed by testing the stool for the toxins that are produced by the bacteria. Just findingC. difficile(by culturing the stool, for example) does not mean that it is causing a problem because not all strains can produce toxins. Even strains that can produce toxins don’t produce them all the time, so the bacteria can be found in perfectly healthy people and animals. Detecting the toxins themselves is the key. Testing animals that do not have diarrhea forC. difficileis not recommended. How IsClostridium difficileInfection Treated? In humans, many cases of CDI are caused by treatment with antibiotics for some other infection. In mild cases, diarrhea may resolve with no additional specific treatment. In severe cases, other antibiotics may be needed to controlC. difficile. Probiotics are not considered effective for the treatment of CDI in humans. Some (if not most) cases of CDI in pets resolve without additional antibiotics. If the animal has a lot of diarrhea it may need to be given fluids to prevent dehydration. There is no vaccine available forC. difficilefor any species. If you (or your pet) develop diarrhea while being treated with antibiotics, tell your physician or veterinarian right away. However, it is very important you only stop or change the medication you are taking or giving to your pet if you are told to do so by your physician or veterinarian. Otherwise, the infection for which the antibiotics were originally prescribed may get worse. What Do I Do If My Pet Is Diagnosed WithClostridium difficile? For surfaces that can’t be bleached, thorough cleaning is the most important step to physically remove as much contamination as possible. Steam cleaning is a reasonable way to reduce the number ofC. difficilespores that may be left in rugs, carpets, or similar floor coverings. Therapy Animals Visiting healthcare facilities is a risk factor forC. difficileshedding in dogs. However, it is unclear whether therapy pets that visit hospitals and nursing homes have an increased risk of developingC. difficilediarrhea. Healthy animals do NOT need to be tested or treated forC. difficile. There are guidelines available to help reduce the risk of pets acquiring infectious diseases in hospitals, which should be followed if your pet is part of a visitation program. These include If I HaveClostridium difficile, Should I Test My Pet? NO. Even if your pet was found to be sheddingC. difficilein its stool, you still would not know if it was the same strain you were carrying. This type of specialized testing is not readily available and is not indicated in most situations. If you haveC. difficile, you should be very thorough about washing your hands after using the washroom. Also try to prevent your pet from drinking from the toilet, if it tends to do so. The risk of disease to the general population posed byC. difficilein house pets such as dogs and cats is: Healthy Adults Individuals with compromised immune systems (e.g. HIV/AIDS, transplant, and cancer patients) are more susceptible to many kinds of infections, including those which may be transmitted by pets. While these individuals are not advised to get rid of their pets, precautions should be taken to reduce the frequency of contacts that could result in pathogen transmission (e.g. avoiding contact with any animal feces), as well as the ability of infectious agents to survive in the household (e.g. prompt and thorough disinfection of potentially contaminated surfaces). Infants and young children (less than 5 years old) are more likely than adults to extensively handle animals if given the opportunity, more likely to touch their faces or mouths, and less likely to wash their hands after handling an animal. Children may “snuggle” with pets such as dogs and cats; this very close contact can increase the risk of disease transmission. Young children should be supervised when playing with animals, and an adult should ensure that they wash their hands afterward, especially before handling food. Older children should be taught to do the same. It is important to note that infants less than 12 months of age are not affected byC. difficile. For these groups, the zoonotic risk posed byC. difficilein house pets such as dogs and cats is likely: Additional Information Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).Clostridium difficileinformationpage.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Clostridium difficileinfection.

Category: Nervous System: Brain, Nerves & Spinal Cord
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is it? Proventricular dilatation disease is an inflammatory disease affecting the gastrointestinal and neurological systems in a variety of bird species. PDD is incurable, but manageable. Consequences of PDD range from gastrointestinal problems causing an increase in the size of the bird’s stomach to neurological symptoms. The disease is caused by avian bornavirus, which targets the bird’s nervous system. The damaged nervous system does not allow nutrients to be digested or absorbed. The virus does not always cause the disease, so a bird can have bornavirus and never develop PDD. Research on the virus and disease is still ongoing with much to be discovered. Who gets it? These are only some of the affected species, but more than 50 different parrot species can be affected. How is it spread? What are the signs? The signs can happen quickly or take time to develop. However, all the symptoms are general and are not specific to PDD. How is it diagnosed? The symptoms of PDD are not specific and there are a variety of potential causes explaining the bird’s illness such as lead toxicity, fungal or bacterial infection, or parasites. Therefore, other potential causes must be ruled out first before a diagnosis of PDD can be made. A physical examination by your veterinarian is first so a professional can see the clinical signs. Tests may include bloodwork, such as complete blood count or serology, radiographs to look for an enlarged stomach, a stomach biopsy to detect infected tissue and nerves, and other laboratory tests, such as PCR. How is it treated? There is no cure for PDD, so treatment reduces inflammation and the other symptoms. How do you prevent it? Infected birds should be isolated for life to prevent the virus spreading to other pet birds. New birds should be isolated and tested for the virus before they are introduced to the flock. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine to protect birds from avian bornavirus.

Category: Dietary Conversion  – Getting your Bird to Eat Right
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English By now you've most likely heard that a pelleted (formulated) diet should make up the majority (70-80%) of your pet bird's diet. Saying this is all good and well for us bird veterinarians, but how can you achieve this at home? Well, like many things, there is more than one way to convert your bird to a healthy diet.  You can use one approach, or combine them. Gradual Introduction With this technique you mix pellets in with your bird's regular food and slowly increase the percentage of pellets being offered. No matter what approach you use, it is important to ensure your bird continues to eat. For some birds 10 days is too quick to allow for complete conversion. In these cases try changing the percentage every other day. This will mean a 20-day conversion period, rather than 10. Depending on your schedule you may or may not see your bird eating much. So how do you make sure your bird is getting adequate nutrition? Substitution This approach is quite simple: Just offer the regular food in the morning and then remove that food at night and introduce the new pelleted diet. Flock Foraging This technique works well for bird species that like to eat on the ground, such as cockatiels and budgies (parakeets). The approach is especially useful for tame birds. Good luck with this sometimes challenging, but always rewarding process. It can lead to life-long health benefits for your feathered friends.

Flock Foraging This technique works well for bird species that like to eat on the ground, such as cockatiels and budgies (parakeets). The approach is especially useful for tame birds. Good luck with this sometimes challenging, but always rewarding process. It can lead to life-long health benefits for your feathered friends.

Category: Backyard Chickens Cause Human Health Risks
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says owners of backyard chickens and other poultry should be made aware of the risks these animals pose to humans, and take basic steps to prevent disease transmission.  I suspect many of you who live in rural areas, and many in urban settings in which cities allow chickens, have backyard poultry; owners need to understand that these birds can spreadSalmonella, Campylobacterand avian influenza to humans.  Numerous human infections ofSalmonellahave been linked to contact with backyard chickens, and these especially occur in children younger than 5 years of age, pregnant women, and people over 65, as all of these groups may have decreased immunity.  Symptoms ofSalmonellaandCampylobacterinclude diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps but symptoms may be more severe if the infection enters the blood stream; in those cases, hospitalization may be required. Avian influenza viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can easily spread and infect domestic poultry; birds can carry the virus in saliva, mucous and feces.  Avian influenza can also infect humans and symptoms can be mild to severe.  Symptoms in people are typical of other flu viruses and cause fever, cough, sore throat, nasal discharge, muscle and body aches, nausea and vomiting.  Preventing disease transmission from poultry to humans involves thorough hand washing with soap, or hand sanitizer if you are unable to wash.  Poultry should certainly not be allowed to enter homes, and owners should designate a pair of shoes only to be worn in the poultry area and not worn in the house.  Children less than 5 should be kept away from poultry. Food and drink should not be consumed in areas where poultry live.

Category: Top Ten Ways to Keep your Bird Safe from Kitchen Dangers
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Companion avians are extra sensitive to what's going on in the air. Whatever they inhale goes to all parts of their bodies very quickly. This sensitivity, coupled with their small size, makes it especially dangerous for birds to breathe in cooking fumes and eat some of the foods and plants that are commonly found in kitchens. ASPCA experts urge bird parents to heed the following precautions in order to prevent curious beaks from getting caught in dangerous situations. For a further list, check out ourtoxic plantpages. Much of the information there is pertinent for birds, as well as dogs, cats, and horses. Remember, if you think your bird has ingested or come in contact with a potentially toxic substance, call your veterinarian or the ASPCA. To reach the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, call (888) 426-4435. For more information, visit the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center online. Tips on cooking safety were provided by Karen Rosenthal, DVM, MS. Extra Tips The following items can also be toxic to your bird: Hairsprays, perfumes, insecticidal fumigants, pesticide sprays, automobile exhausts, and fumes from glue and paint. The ASPCANational Animal Poison Controlis available 24 hours a day at 888-426-4435. Expect an initial consultation fee of around $100.00 and additional follow-up is at no charge.

Category: DNA Vaccine Approved for Chickens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Some new exciting technology has gained USDA conditional approval for the poultry industry. It is a DNA vaccine for avian influenza.  Agrilabs indicates the vaccine is created by splicing a gene for a specific antigen related to an avian influenza virus into a bacterial plasmid, and then the plasmid is administered along with an adjuvant that improves vaccine delivery into target cells.  Once the antigen is in the target cells, an immune response is triggered to hopefully allow the animal’s immune system to fight off the disease.  The conditional license allows Agrilabs to stock pile large amounts of the vaccine if the vaccine is needed for a future avian flu outbreak.  The company indicates this is a major milestone in realizing the promise of DNA vaccines in animal health.  Past DNA vaccines have failed to be effective and were too costly and inconvenient, but the company’s newly developed adjuvant has helped to increase effectiveness. An adjuvant is a chemical added to a vaccine to make it more effective. DNA vaccines do not expose animals to the actual disease so there is no risk of the animal developing the disease as could happen with a modified live viral vaccine.  And if vaccinated animals do become infected, it can be determined if the infection is due to the virus or the vaccine.  The company indicates that the adjuvant is a really important part of this vaccine as it allows a lower dose of vaccine to be used, which lowers the cost.  The company is also using the same technology to develop vaccines for swine influenza and cattle.  Avian influenza is highly contagious and deadly, and because many chickens are housed together, avian influenza can wipe out an entire flock in a short period of time.

Category: Lead Contamination in Backyard Chickens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many folks are raising backyard chickens for meat and eggs as they are trying to get a safer alternative to commercially produced eggs.  However, Dr. Radford Davis at Iowa State indicates that there are some concerns that the birds can be exposed to heavy metals such as lead, and they could pass toxic lead on to people in the eggs or meat. The chickens may pick up lead from sources like contaminated water or food, but the most likely source of lead is contaminated soil.  Soil can be contaminated by flakes of lead-based paint that may have come off older buildings or even be contaminated if guns were shot nearby in the past.  A study out of California recently looked at lead exposure in backyard chickens and lead contamination of eggs, which can affect human health.  Livers from about 1500 backyard chickens were tested for a 1-year period and over 3% were positive for lead. Most lead-positive chickens were from urban areas, not rural ones. The chickens with the highest lead concentration would lay eggs that would double the recommended amount of lead for a child under 6 years old, and liver exposure in children can lead to behavior disorders, attention deficit disorders, decreased brain volume and decreased IQ.  Even at lower levels, repeated consumption of lead can cause a problem as lead was found in chicken feed, paint chips and blood from other chickens in the flock.  Most chickens did not have clinical signs although still had enough lead in their bodies to contaminate meat and eggs and potentially cause illness in humans. To prevent this, check your soil for lead (ask your veterinarian how to do that in your area) and also check lead levels in eggs before feeding them to your family.

Category: Feather Picking (Feather Destructive Behavior)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Feather picking is an all too common condition in pet bird population. Also known as feather destructive behavior or feather damaging behavior (FDB), it seems to be most common in African gray parrots, Quakers and various cockatoo species. Additionally, it is not uncommon among cockatiels, lovebirds and parrotlets. That being said, feather destructive behavior can occur in any bird species. This condition can often be frustrating to owners, and achieving a correct diagnosis and cure of the underlying condition can prove challenging for even the most experienced avian veterinarian. Many people think of FDB as strictly a cosmetic issue; this is often not entirely true and FDB may have a serious underlying medical cause. Feather picking is more accurately defined as a symptom rather than a specific disease. There are many different possible causes. Broadly, these causes are categorized into two groups: medical and behavioral. Medical Causes Medical picking usually occurs because of an underlying disease that causes pain, irritation and or direct feather damage. Several examples of medically-induced FDB include: kidney and/or liver damage or failure; testicular or ovarian disease; musculoskeletal damage; gastrointestinal diseases or dysfunction; certain viral conditions; primary bacterial or fungal dermatitis; allergic skin disease; internal or external parasites; nutritional deficiencies. In order to diagnose these medical causes, a variety of diagnostic tests may be required in addition to a thorough history and physical examination. Behavioral Causes In simple terms, behavioral feather picking is often associated with boredom. In the wild, a bird's day is filled with activity; they spend the majority of their day foraging for fresh food and water and finding secure nesting or roosting sites. They also tend to spend a great deal of time socializing with other birds and preening themselves as well as other flock members. In the comforts of our homes and apartments, birds often need only walk a few inches along a perch to find large dishes full of plentiful food and water. They are often alone for many waking hours as the other members of their flock (humans in this case) leave the roost and go to work or school for the day. Typically most pet birds lack a companion for company and mutual preening, and this may predispose them to over grooming, which is often the first step on the road to feather-damaging behavior. Unfortunately, buying a companion bird may not cure a bird that is already picking, and in some cases may even worsen the situation due to incompatibility. In addition to boredom, other causes of feather picking include lack of exercise, inappropriate sleep patterns, and poorly directed reproductive behaviors. Diagnostic Approach It has always been my approach to first attempt to exclude medical causes of picking while always keeping in mind the behavioral components of the disease. This way, serious and potentially life-threatening diseases are not overlooked. Additionally, this approach may allow us to diagnose more minor conditions that, while not life threatening, can cause serious feather destructive behavior. Unfortunately, if left untreated for long periods of time, feather picking can become a habit. This may mean that when the instigating cause is discovered and cured, the feather damaging behavior may continue. In these instances a combined medical/behavioral approach is critical. The assumption that all feather damaging is behavioral in origin is simplistic, incorrect and may have potentially serious ramifications for the patient. Only when we are confident that all underlying medical causes have been ruled out will we consider the condition to be primarily behavioral in nature.
