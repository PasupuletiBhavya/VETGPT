Category: Common Diseases of Hedgehogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are 17 different species of hedgehogs found throughout the world, but none are native to North America. However, that has not stopped these cute, spikey critters from making their way into our homes and hearts throughout the United States and in many other countries. African pygmy hedgehogs,the most popular species to have as a pet, are adored for their cuteness and uniqueness in the animal kingdom. They are highly active nocturnal animals that spend their days resting and come alive at night to collect (and chase) their meals, which usually consist of fruits, vegetables, and insects in the wild. Hedgehogs enjoy a simple life of solitude, and they rely on their spikes and ability to curl up into a ball to protect them from the terrors of the outside world, which can include anything from owls and wolves in the wild to loud noises or new people in our homes. Hedgehogs usually live for anywhere from 4-6 years, and males should weigh between 500-700g (17.6-24.7 oz) whereas females should weigh around 250-400g (8.8-14.1 oz). As with any other species, there are certain diseases that we commonly see in hedgehogs ranging from obesity to neurological problems, and veterinarians can use the specific signs associated with each disease to determine which part of the body is being affected and what the best treatment will be. Skin Disease Skin diseases are fairly common in hedgehogs, and they typically lead to dry, scaly skin. Skin scrapes can be examined under a microscope or cultured to diagnose the irritants causing the problem. Dermatophytosis, or ringworm, is a skin disease common to hedgehogs that involves scaly areas around the base of the spines. It can be treated with topical antifungals and is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread to humans. Mite infestations also include crusting and flaking of the skin and anti-parasitic drugs are used to eliminate the infestation; however, it is also important to keep your hedgehog’s environment clean and treat any other hedgehogs living in the home, as mites are very good at spreading through the environment- don’t worry, these mites are specific to hedgehogs. Obesity Obesity is a common issue seen in hedgehogs because most pet hedgehogs have unlimited access to food, likely in addition to not being active enough throughout the day. This combination can lead to a variety of problems from not being able to roll into a ball for protection to other more serious diseases like hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease). Prevention is the best way to approach obesity, so you must feed appropriate amounts of high-quality food to your hedgehog, provide enrichment opportunities that promote activity, and monitor their weight so that you can catch any weight gain early and adjust their diet accordingly. Getting a food scale to weigh your hedgehog on weekly is a great way to stay on top of their weight. Once an animal has become obese, treatment involves a weight loss program, which means fewer calories a day and more enrichment to promote activity. Offering insects to eat is a great way to increase a hedgehog’s activity level while also supporting their natural feeding behaviors and providing a valuable source of nutrients. Gastrointestinal Diseases Gastrointestinal diseases include anything that affects the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestine, colon, or rectum. Signs to look out for include diarrhea, dehydration, decreased appetite, and weight loss.Salmonellainfection, the most common type in hedgehogs, can be diagnosed with a fecal culture. Treatment involves supportive care and antibiotics. It is also important to consider that this bacteria can be spread to humans (zoonotic disease) therefore, we must be careful when handling and treating potentially infected animals. Fractured teeth can make it difficult for your hedgehog to eat, leading to unwanted weight loss and excessive salivation. Dental radiographs and an oral exam can diagnose those bad teeth, and treatment includes pain medicine, antibiotics, and potentially even tooth extractions if the fracture is causing additional problems. Diarrhea and intestinal inflammation are somewhat non-specific signs, which means they can result from a variety of different problems ranging from an inappropriate diet to a bacterial infection. The specific cause of these issues can be diagnosed using diet trials, fecal cultures, and radiographs, and the specific findings will guide the treatment. One specific disease, Hepatic lipidosis, is relatively common in hedgehogs and can develop as a result of any disease that leads to a sudden lack of appetite, like infections or cancer. Cancer Cancer is unfortunately common in hedgehogs above the age of 3 years old. They can get many different types of cancer including squamous cell carcinomas, cutaneous mast cell tumors, mammary gland tumors, cutaneous hemangiosarcomas, and reproductive tumors, all of which must be removed. Signs vary based on the type of cancer that they have, but they can include difficulty eating, lethargy, weakness, swelling of the belly, weight loss, blood in the urine, or vaginal discharge. Diagnosis can potentially require bloodwork, radiographs, ultrasound, or a biopsy, and treatment involves removing the tumor, supportive care, and possibly chemotherapy and radiation. Heart Disease Heart disease in hedgehogs is usually due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which means one or more of the heart’s chambers are enlarged. Hedgehogs with DCM can experience difficulty breathing, lethargy, weight loss, and potentially a heart murmur, but it can also lead to sudden death if not treated when these signs arise. Therapy involves medication to manage chronic heart failure, but unfortunately, the damage to the heart is irreversible. Respiratory Disease Hedgehogs are sensitive to respiratory disease caused byBordetella, Pasteurella,andCorynebacteriuminfections. Watch out for sneezing, nasal discharge, or difficulty breathing. Diagnosis involves radiographs and culture of their discharge and is treated with antibiotics. In severe cases, oxygen and opening of the airways may be needed to avoid a serious lack of oxygen. Neurological Disease Wobbly hedgehog syndrome is a neurologic condition characterized by progressive loss of control of their limbs and weight loss that ultimately leads to paralysis. It can potentially be fatal. The cause of wobbly hedgehogs is unknown, however, genetics is believed to play a role. Treatment involves supportive care and hand feeding. Unfortunately,  there is no cure for this condition. Musculoskeletal Injuries Musculoskeletal injuries affect the hedgehog’s ability to move and use their muscles. Some common injuries include strangling of their little toes and legs due to frayed cloth in bedding (chewed by hedgehogs, of course) and overgrown toenails that get caught in the cage or grow into their footpad. Avoid injuries like these with consistent grooming and monitoring of their environment. Summary Hedgehogs are vulnerable to many different diseases, as are most pets. When it comes to finding and diagnosing these problems, owners who pay attention to their hedgehog's eating and overall activities are vital to a veterinarian’s success. You know your hedgehog better than anyone else, so you are the best equipped to determine when they are acting out of the ordinary and need to be seen by a veterinarian.

Category: Tibial Tuberosity Advancement (TTA) Surgery for Cranial Cruciate Ligament Rupture
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) is a surgical procedure that can be performed in animals to treat cranial cruciate ligament disease/rupture. What is the Cranial Cruciate Ligament? The cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) is a ligament in the back leg that stabilizes an animal’s knee. You may have heard it called the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in humans. Ligaments are tissues that connect one bone to another and are an important part of keeping the knee strong. Two cruciate ligaments cross through the inside of the knee, making an “X” shape (which is where the name “cruciate,” meaning cross-shaped, comes from). The first cruciate ligament, the cranial cruciate ligament, stretches from the front of the lower leg bone, called the tibia, to the back of the upper leg bone, called the femur. It keeps the tibia from sliding forward, where it would no longer be lined up with the femur and could cause weakness. The other cruciate ligament, the caudal cruciate ligament, stretches from the back of the tibia to the front of the femur and helps the cranial cruciate ligament to keep the knee strong. Of the two, the cranial cruciate ligament is more commonly affected.   Cranial Cruciate Ligament Rupture While the cranial cruciate ligament can rupture as a result of trauma, this is unusual. The most common cause of rupture is a gradual degeneration of the ligament over a period of months or years due to a condition we call “cruciate disease.” When the ligament ruptures, the knee is less stable, causing excessive movement between the femur and tibia. This results in pain, which causes limping. This condition is seen in cats, but it is more commonly identified in dogs. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a CCL rupture is made following a physical examination where swelling or thickening is detected in the knee. Muscle wastage may also be seen in the upper aspect of the limb. In some cases, there may be abnormal motion of the knee, which you may hear your veterinarian refer to as a “drawer sign”; however, this is not seen in all cases. Pain is normally detected when the knee is manipulated. There are several tests your veterinarian can perform to check for this abnormality, with some of the most common being the cranial drawer test and the tibial compression test. (Ruptured Cranial Cruciate Ligaments in Dogs) X-rays are an essential part of the investigations to confirm the findings from the physical examination and eliminate other possible causes of knee pain. TTA Surgery Several surgeries are used to treat a CCL rupture, each with its own indications, advantages, and drawbacks. Your veterinarian will use your pet’s age, size, and activity level and will take several special measurements from X-rays of the affected knee to decide which is most suitable and to plan the surgery. While not an emergency, surgery is often recommended as soon as possible to prevent further injury to the joint, causing further damage. The TTA procedure is complicated and requires specialized training, so your pet will likely be referred to a veterinary orthopedic surgeon to perform the surgery. During the TTA procedure, the front ridge of the tibia, called the tibial tuberosity, is cut and separated from the rest of the bone. A special orthopedic spacer is placed between this piece and the rest of the bone, which allows that portion to be reattached at a different angle, moving the lower portion of the knee forward and upwards (advancing it). Doing so realigns the patellar ligament, which runs vertically down the front of the knee to hold the patella (or kneecap) in place, creating more stability and eliminating some of the abnormal movement of the knee. This change is made so that when the pet puts weight on their knee, it pushes the femur backward to keep it aligned with the tibia below. This makes the knee joint more stable and reduces difficulty and pain during walking or standing. In effect, this surgery removes the need for the cranial cruciate ligament. An important part of this surgery is the assessment of the menisci (shock absorbers in the knee), as in approximately 60% of cases, they may be damaged as a result of the instability. What to Expect After Surgery and During Recovery TTA offers a rapid return to normal function and natural range of motion. Most animals can bear weight quickly after surgery, usually within 10 days. Full function and return to normal activity are usually achieved within three to four months after surgery. Your pet will be placed on restricted exercise for about eight to 12 weeks to allow for proper healing. This usually means short walks on a leash, no rough play, and no jumping on beds or other furniture. Your veterinarian may recommend pain management and rehabilitation during the recovery time. This can include anti-inflammatory medications, ice packs, and gentle leg manipulations. Your pet will need to return to their veterinarian within 10 to 14 days after surgery for suture removal. Further rehabilitation exercises, such as light activity and the use of a water treadmill, may be recommended. The skin incision should heal within 10 to 14 days; however, the cut bone can take eight to 12 weeks to heal. It is important to prevent your pet from running, jumping, and stair climbing during the healing process to minimize the risk of complications. Complications may be mild or can be serious (infection, movement of the implants, fracture of the leg), so if you are concerned at all, it is recommended you seek advice from your veterinarian. Your pet will need further visits with their veterinarian for X-rays to ensure the knee is healing properly. You will be guided through this when your pet is discharged.

Category: Adverse Reactions to Spot-on Flea and Tick Products
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Spot-on flea and tick products for dogs and cats have greatly improved the safety and convenience of controlling external parasites on our pets. Using pesticides that are many degrees less toxic and frequently more effective than the organophosphate or carbamate dips and sprays of the past, these spot-on products help keep our pets (and our homes) free of annoying pests that can also carry serious diseases. When used according to the label directions, spot-on products are well tolerated by most pets. However, as with any product that is applied directly on the skin, there is the possibility that certain individuals will have adverse local reactions to one or more ingredients in the product. Some individuals will have similar reactions to many different spot-on products with different active ingredients, suggesting that their sensitivities may be to some of the inactive ingredients. These reactions are restricted to the area of skin that comes in direct contact with the product, so they do not reflect a systemic toxicosis but rather a local hypersensitivity. Skin reactions to spot-on products can vary from mild tingling sensations to actual chemical burns of the skin in especially sensitive individuals. The mildest form of skin reaction to spot-on products is epidermal paresthesia, which is defined as an abnormal sensation such as an itch or prickling of the skin. Paresthesia occurs when the applied product "tickles" the nerve endings in the skin, causing the characteristic sensation. Although paresthesia may occur with any spot-on product, it is most commonly associated with products containing concentrated pyrethroids such as permethrin, cyphenothrin, and etofenprox. Pyrethroid paresthesia is a syndrome that has been well documented in both humans and animals. Human descriptions of pyrethroid paresthesia vary from "tingling" to "pins and needles" to "burning" sensations in the skin at the site of pyrethroid contact. These sensations begin within 30 minutes of application and may last 8 to 24 hours if untreated. Some pets appear to experience similar discomfort following application of spot-on products; the fact that the products are generally applied between the shoulder blades can make the sensation particularly annoying to the pets. Affected pets, cats in particular, may become hyperactive and agitated as they try to walk away from the sensation; others may become quiet, subdued and reluctant to move. Skin at the product application site will appear normal (if redness is noted, you're dealing with contact dermatitis, see below). Fortunately, treating epidermal paresthesia is fairly simple and entails bathing off the product with a mild dish soap (pet shampoos are too mild to remove all of the product). For pyrethroid paresthesia, applying vitamin E to the affected skin can provide quick relief— just use scissors to snip open a vitamin E capsule (the kind used as a vitamin supplement) and squeeze the oily contents onto the pet's skin and rub it in. A rare but more significant skin reaction (in terms of sensitivity) to spot-on products is contact dermatitis, in which an inflammatory reaction develops in response to the topically applied product. These responses - sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity reactions - can occur upon the first use of a product, but more commonly occur after several uneventful exposures to the product. The body sets up an inflammatory response to the site of application, and the skin will appear red and irritated. In more severe cases, wheals or blisters may develop and the skin may actually ulcerate. Unlike paresthesia, which tends to occur within 30 minutes of application, oftentimes the onset of contact dermatitis is delayed for several hours, with the full extent of the injury taking 12 to 24 hours to develop. Depending on the degree of the inflammatory reaction, the level of discomfort can range from mild to quite severe. After bathing off the spot-on product, pets who develop more than mild redness at the application site should be seen by their veterinarians for further treatment to reduce the inflammation and discomfort. The good news is that skin reactions to spot-on flea/tick control products are quite uncommon, and most pets will have no problems when these products are used. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict which individual will react to a given product until the reaction has occurred. For this reason, it is a good idea to observe your pet closely for at least an hour following the application of any spot-on product for any signs of discomfort. Although not life-threatening, skin reactions can range from mildly annoying to very painful; for this reason, a pet that has had a reaction to a spot-on product should never have the same product applied in the future. If a spot-on product is still desired for flea and/or tick control, try a product with different active ingredients than the one that caused the reaction. Following application, watch the pet carefully and be ready to bathe at the first sign of problems. Unfortunately, there are rare individuals that cannot tolerate any of the topical spot-on products, and other flea control options such as sprays or dips may be needed. More serious problems can result when spot-on flea/tick products designed for dogs are inappropriately applied to cats. Certain concentrated pyrethroids (e.g. permethrin) that are not harmful to dogs can cause life-threatening tremors and/or seizures if applied to cats—these are not really adverse events but are instead true poisonings since the product was misused.  Always read the label before using any topical flea/tick product on cats, andneverapply products intended for dogs onto cats. Frontline (fipronil) istoxic to rabbits. If your pet has a reaction to a flea or tick control product of any kind, you should report the reaction. All spot-on product labels will have a phone number that you can use to report the reaction to the manufacturer. By law, the manufacturer is required to send monthly reports of adverse reactions to the appropriate federal regulating authority. Alternatively, you can go to the agencies' websites to find out how to report reactions directly to them. Report reactions to flea/tick products containing heartworm preventatives, such as Revolution and Advantage Multi, to the Food and Drug Administration; report flea/tick products that do not contain heartworm preventatives to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Category: Atopic Dermatitis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Atopic dermatitis in dogs (allergic dermatitis, canineatopy) is a hypersensitivity or over-reaction to a variety of commonplace and otherwise harmless substances in the environment. These allergens include plant pollens,house dust mites, or mold spores. Most allergic dogs begin to show signs between one and three years of age. Due to the hereditary nature of the disease, several breeds of dogs appear predisposed to allergies. These dog breeds include Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, West Highland White Terriers and other terriers, and Bulldogs. However any dog, including mixed breed dogs, can have atopic dermatitis. Signs Atopic dogs will scratch, chew, lick, or rub areas of the body such as their paws, face, and rear end. They can have recurrent skin, ear, and anal gland inflammation and infections. This itchy behavior, or pruritus, can cause hair loss and reddening and thickening of the skin. In some dogs, other causes can work with a dog’s allergies to cause itching. For example, parasites such as fleas or infection from bacteria or yeast can all worsen the level of itching from allergies. Therefore, it is important to treat any other health problems that could cause itching to manage your pet’s allergies. Diagnosis Once your pet’s veterinarian has diagnosed atopic dermatitis, allergy tests can be used to identify what a pet is allergic to in the environment. There are two types of allergy tests, the intradermal allergy test and blood testing for allergies (serologic allergy testing). In an intradermal allergy test, the fur is clipped on one side of the chest and small amounts of common allergens are injected into the skin. The skin is then observed for a reaction to the allergen. In a blood allergy test, a blood sample is obtained and sent to a laboratory. At the laboratory, the protein levels (antibodies) to the allergens are measured. Each allergy test has its advantages and disadvantages. Most veterinary dermatologists recommend intradermal allergy testing. This is because many factors, including which laboratory is performing the test, can affect the results of blood allergy testing. However, intradermal allergy testing has the disadvantage of needing to be done by a specialist and usually requires a mild sedative to relax the dog during the test. Treatment If a dog is diagnosed with atopic dermatitis, there are three methods of therapy.

Category: Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called DLE, Nasal Solar Dermatitis, or Collie Nose) Lupus – What is this Disease? Lupus is an immune-mediated disease stemming from your own immune system reacting against your own DNA. This in itself sounds like a recipe for disaster since almost every cell in a body has DNA in it, but it is important to remember that under normal circumstances your DNA is sequestered in a cell nucleus where the antibodies of the immune system cannot reach it. The immune system in lupus is not going around attacking every cell in the body to get to its DNA; instead, the immune system only sees DNA after cells have died and their assorted broken parts are floating around as debris. The immune system reacts to this loose DNA and generates antibodies. These antibody:DNA complexes deposit in delicate membranes, such as the kidney filtration membranes, blood vessel linings, joint capsules, and other similar structures. Once caught in these membranes, other immunologic cells are attracted and further inflammatory damage results. Systemic lupus (SLE)involves this kind of inflammatory disruption (called a Type III hypersensitivity reaction) and the prognosis depends on which organ systems are affected and how severe the damage is. The disease is not curable but is manageable with immuno-suppressive drugs. The name “lupus” stems from archaic times when the disease was thought to have been caused by the bite of a wolf. Systemic Lupus Versus Discoid Lupus When people use the term lupus, they are referring to systemic lupus, or SLE as described above. Discoid lupus is a form of lupus that is confined to the skin and is substantially more benign because of this confinement. Discoid lupus, or DLE, is almost exclusively a canine disease and is almost always limited to the leather of the nose, called the nasal planum. Features of Discoid Lupus (DLE) The immune-system in lupus is not going around attacking every cell in the body to get to its DNA; instead, the immune system only sees DNA after cells have died and their assorted broken parts are floating around as debris. DLE does not progress to SLE. Lesions of DLE are almost always limited to the nose though they can extend up the bridge of the nose and sometimes affect the ears or inside the mouth. Early signs of the condition start with loss of nose pigment. A black nose will become bluish-grey or even pink. Scaling and cracking of the skin results and eventually, the nose will ulcerate. Exposure to sunshine makes the condition worse and there seems to be a genetic predisposition among the collie breeds (hence the term collie nose). There are several other conditions that also cause crusts and/or erosions on the nose, so it is important to get the right diagnosis. Some other conditions to rule out include: Diagnosis is by biopsy, which means a small piece of nose tissue must be harvested and sent to the laboratory for analysis. Most dogs will not hold still for this kind of procedure on their nose so sedation is generally needed to get proper samples. Expect stitches afterward; some mild bleeding is possible. Diagnosis also involves some important historical information such as whether other body areas are involved, whether the condition is constant or comes and goes, and what medications have helped in the past. The pathologist will consider all of this information along with the microscopic appearance of the tissue.  Therapy Choices Discoid lupus is a condition with many treatment options depending on the severity of symptoms. Avoid Strong SunlightSince this condition is made worse by the sun, it is important to avoid intense sunlight. Sunscreens have been advocated but it is important to realize that there are toxic ingredients in many human sunscreens and anything you apply to a dog’s nose will be licked off. Pet sunscreens are expected to be licked. For an FDA pet-approved sun protectorendorsedby the Food and Drug Administration and endorsed by the American Animal Hospital Association and the SPCA, visit:https://epi-pet.com/ Other sun-shielding products of interest include nose shields and UV light filtering sun visors:http://www.dognoseprotectors.com/ https://protectivepetsolutions.com/collections/dog-line/products/optivizor-long-snout-clear-uv-tint Topical CorticosteroidsThe immune-suppressive effects of steroids are helpful in DLE but the systemic side effects are undesirable. Side effects are minimized by using topical steroids, typically starting twice a day and eventually dropping to an as-needed basis for maintenance after the nose is healed. Tetracycline/NiacinamideTetracycline is an antibiotic with immunomodulating properties separate from its antibiotic properties. Niacinamide (also called nicotinamide) is a B vitamin supplement related to niacin (vitamin B3). The combination of these two medications has been found effective in 70% of dogs with DLE though it can take up to two months to see an effect. Treatment is given three times daily, which is relatively inconvenient for most people so alternatives have been sought.Doxycyclinecan be used twice a day and is frequently substituted for tetracycline. Prednisone/PrednisoloneOral steroids are often used to get the condition under control relatively quickly (within a month) and can be used after that as the sole therapy after the lowest effective maintenance dose is determined. Side effects include panting, excessive thirst and urination, and increased appetite. None of these effects are particularly desirable so often steroids are used in conjunction with one of the other therapies with the idea of dropping back the steroids when the second therapy can take over. Oral CyclosporineCylosporineis an immunomodulator that has found extensive use in veterinary medicine for a number of immune-mediated conditions including allergy. It can be used to control DLE but has some potential for side effects (mostly upset stomach) that might not be worthwhile for milder cases. 0.1% Tacrolimus (Protopic®)This is a topical immunomodulator made for human use. It is very effective for use in DLE and does not cause problems if licked. Only small amounts of ointment are needed and the tube should last a long time which is good news since it is not inexpensive. The person applying the medication should wear gloves to avoid unneeded exposure. If your dog is diagnosed with discoid lupus, discuss therapy options with your veterinarian. If your dog has a crusty or ulcerated nose, expect a biopsy to be needed to sort out the diagnosis properly before treatment can be prescribed.

Category: Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia (IMT)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Immune Destruction of Blood Platelets, also called ITP or IMT ) What is a Platelet? A platelet is a cloud-shaped blood cell, neither related to the red blood cell line nor the white blood cell line. Platelets assist in the clotting of blood in that they home in on damaged areas of blood vessels and aggregate there, meaning that they pile onto each other and bind, forming a small plug to seal the hole in the leaking blood vessel. While piled on each other, they release assorted biochemicals that initiate a more permanent fibrous seal of the tear. Of course, large tears are too big for platelets to seal but when it comes to small bleeds and normal blood vessel wear and tear, platelets are the star of the show. There is a saying that “platelets are vascular integrity and vascular integrity is platelets.” A small bleed unstaunched by a platelet aggregation quickly becomes a large bruise. Spontaneous bruising (in other words, visible bruising from the normal wear and tear of one's body) is a sign of reduced platelet numbers or poor platelet function. Small abnormal bruises are called petechiae or petechial hemorrhages.  Large abnormal bruises are called ecchymoses or ecchymotic hemorrhages. Platelets in Times of Health Platelets come from the bone marrow where a large (actually gigantic relative to the red and white blood cell precursors) cell called a megakaryocyte spits off little active pieces of itself. These pieces are platelets, ready to enter circulation where they will live for an average of 8 to 12 days in a dog or 6 to 8 days in a human before a bleeding capillary calls them to their destiny. At any given time some 200,000 to 500,000 platelets are on patrol in the circulatory system, though only about 20,000 to 50,000 are considered the bare minimum to prevent spontaneous bruising and bleeding. About one-third of the circulating platelets are stored in the spleen, like boats in a harbor, ready to mobilize if necessary. When platelets become too old to be useful, the spleen has cells called phagocytes that essentially eat old cells and recycle their inner materials. Immune-Mediated Platelet Destruction For reasons unknown, platelets can be mistaken by the immune system for invaders. When this happens, antibodies coat the platelets and the spleen’s phagocytes (a type of cell that absorbs other cells) remove them in numbers up to 10 times greater than the normal platelet removal rate. In a normal situation, old platelets are removed in the liver, an interaction that generates a message to the bone marrow megakaryocytic (bone marrow cells that produce platelets) to make more platelets. In immune-mediated disease, the platelet removal venue switches to the spleen, and the interaction is different; the megakaryocytic in the marrow may or may not be stimulated properly. If the marrow successfully receives the message to make more platelets, the megakaryocytes respond by getting larger and growing in numbers so that they may increase their platelet production. The platelets produced under these circumstances tend to be larger and more effective than normal platelets and are called stress platelets. The bone marrow attempts to overcome the accelerated platelet destruction rate by stepping up production; unfortunately, with immune-mediated destruction occurring, a platelet can expect to survive only one day or less in circulation instead of its normal 8 to 12 days. If antibody levels are high, a platelet may survive only minutes or hours after its release from the bone marrow, and making matters worse, the antibody-coated platelets still circulating do not function normally. This is balanced by the especially effective stress platelets entering the scene so that overall it is hard to predict how the balance will work out in a given patient. Making matters worse, sometimes the bone marrow simply does not receive the message to make more platelets. What Would Cause the Immune System to get so Confused? Keep in mind that the immune system responds to the shapes of proteins present on a cell’s surface. These shapes are similar to ID cards. The immune system recognizes shapes defined as “self” and does not attack but when it sees a cell expressing protein shapes that are “non-self,” it will respond. If the immune system is responding to a blood parasite, tumor, drug, or other cell type (as in lupus orimmune-mediated hemolytic anemia), it will be producing antibodies against enemy shapes. Some of these shapes may, unfortunately, resemble some “self” shapes such as some of the shapes on the surface of the platelets. The platelets are then misidentified as the enemy and are attacked. What Happens to the Patient? The usual patient is a middle-aged dog. Poodles appear to be predisposed although Cocker Spaniels and Old English Sheepdogs also seem to have a higher than average incidence of this condition. Spontaneous bruising is the major clinical sign. The gums and oral surfaces as well as the whites of the eyes are obvious areas to check as is the hairless area of the belly. Small spots of bruising in large conglomerations called petechiae (pet-TEEK-ee-a) are the hallmark sign. A large, purple expansive bruise might also be seen, which is called ecchymosis. Large internal bleeds are not typical of platelet dysfunction, though bleeding small amounts in urine, from the nose, or rectally may also indicate a platelet problem. When these sorts of signs are seen, a platelet count is drawn, along with usually an array of clotting parameters, red blood cell counts to assess blood loss, and other general metabolic blood tests. Since reliable testing to detect anti-platelet antibodies is not available, the veterinarian must determine if any other possible causes of low platelet count make sense. Causes of Platelet Reduction Dramatic reduction in platelet numbers is almost always caused by primary immune-mediated destruction, which means there is no apparent cause; the immune system just went haywire. That said, it may be worth making an effort to identify a blood parasite or other cause of the platelet drop. If an infectious agent such as one of these is responsible for the immune-mediated platelet destruction, obviously specific therapy against the infection is warranted in addition to therapy for the platelet destruction. Very low platelet counts can also occur in response to the suppression of megakaryocytes within the bone marrow. This might be caused by: Disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC) is a life-threatening, disastrous failure of normal blood clotting and clot-dissolving functions in the body. One of its hallmark signs is a drop in platelet count, along with a constellation of other signs. If platelet numbers are normal but it is obvious that platelet function is not, some other causes to look into might include: Therapy for Immune-Mediated Platelet Destruction Once a tentative diagnosis of immune-mediated platelet destruction has been made, the goal of therapy is to stop the phagocytes of the spleen from removing the antibody-coated platelets by cutting off antibody production. This, of course, means suppression of the immune system using whatever combination of medications seems to work best for the individual patient. Prednisolone, Prednisone,orDexamethasoneThese steroid hormones are the first line of defense and, often all that is necessary to bring platelet counts back up. Unfortunately, long-term use should be expected and this means steroid side effects are eventually inevitable: excessive thirst, possible urinary tract infection, panting, poor hair coat, etc. The good news is that these effects should resolve once the medication is discontinued; further, if side effects are especially problematic, other medications can be brought in to reduce the dose of steroid needed. Prednisolone is the pre-activated form of prednisone. VincristineThis injectable medication is mildly immune suppressive but also seems to stimulate a sudden burst of platelet release from the marrow megakaryocytes. The platelets released in response to vincristine contain a phagocyte toxin so that when they are ultimately eaten by spleen phagocytes, the phagocytes will die. While repeated injections of vincristine, ine ultimately do not yield the same effect, at least a one-time dose may be extremely helpful.Vincristineis extremely irritating if delivered outside of the vein. It must be given by IV cleanly or the overlying tissue will slough. Vincristine is generally used for unstable or more severely affected patients. Azathioprine,Cyclophosphamideor Mycophenolate When corticosteroids alone have not yielded a good response after a week or if a reduction in steroids dose is desired, a second immune-suppressive agent can be used. These medications may not have steroid side effects but they have other issues of their own that must be considered. Cyclosporine is an immune modulator often used in organ transplantation. TransfusionYou might think that a transfusion of blood or at least platelet-rich plasma might be helpful in treating platelet dysfunction. The problem is that platelets do not survive well after removal from a blood donor. You have about 12 hours to deliver the freshly withdrawn blood to the recipient before the platelets become inactive. After the platelets are delivered, they are likely to live only for hours. In general, most efforts are spent on establishing immune suppression. That said, if the patient has had significant blood loss as a result of her platelet deficiency, a transfusion will certainly replace red blood cells even if it cannot effectively replace platelets. Gamma Globulin TransfusionGamma globulins are blood proteins including antibodies. Human gamma globulin appears to occupy the phagocyte antibody binding site so that coated platelets cannot be grabbed out of circulation. This has been a promising therapy for both humans and dogs but is generally prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, research has shown that results are similar to those obtained simply by using vincristine. Since a less expensive treatment exists with less potential for side effects, gamma globulin therapy is rarely used. SplenectomyIf the medication simply does not work or the condition keeps recurring once medications are discontinued, the solution may be to simply remove the spleen. After all, this is where the phagocytes removing the platelets are primarily located. In humans, immune-mediated platelet destruction is generally treated with splenectomy first. Response in dogs has not been as predictably good, thus in veterinary medicine, it is generally one of the last therapies invoked and is reserved for patients with recurrence issues. TPO Receptor Agonists (Romiplostim and Eltrombopag) Hepatic thrombopoietin is one of the factors the liver makes in response to removing old platelets from circulation. Remember, when platelet removal switches to the spleen in this disease, hepatic thrombopoietin is not generated and the bone marrow may not be properly stimulated. These two agents have revolutionized ITP treatment in humans so we bring them up here. They act by enhancing the marrow's response to hepatic thrombopoietin. The problem is that eltrombopag does not bind to canine receptors and studies of romiplostim in dogs are sparse. That said, it may not be long before research progresses and TPO receptor agonists are included in therapy. Prognosis The good news is that 70-90% of dogs with ITP will recover. Factors that bode poorly include: Treatment continues long after the patient appears to have recovered with the immune-suppressive agents tapered down slowly over several months. Recurrence occurs in approximately 30% of affected dogs and most commonly occurs after two to three months from diagnosis. When recurrence happens, medications must be stepped up. Of the dogs that suffer a recurrence, approximately 50% will suffer yet another one. Splenectomy results in permanent remission in approximately 60% of patients and is likely a good choice for a dog with a recurrence problem.

Category: Seasonal Flank Alopecia in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Also called canine flank alopecia, cyclic flank alopecia, and recurrent flank alopecia. What is Seasonal Flank Alopecia? Seasonal flank alopecia is exactly what it sounds like, though it helps to know that the word alopecia means hair loss. With seasonal flank alopecia, a dog loses hair in the flank area on a seasonal basis. Different dogs seem to choose different seasons to lose their hair (fall and spring are popular), and when the season changes, the hair generally grows back. Sometimes a dog will skip a season only to lose hair again the next year. Most affected breeds are Boxers, Airedales, and English bulldogs, though numerous other breeds have been affected. The hair loss is generally confined to the flanks (the area just ahead of the rear legs) though sometimes the bridge of the nose is involved. The skin is typically darkly pigmented in the areas of hair loss. Both flanks are generally affected symmetrically, and sometimes, there is a skin infection in the balding areas. Sometimes the hair re-grows in a different color than the original hair. Some dogs never re-grow their hair. Diagnosis is generally made by the classic appearance of the pigmented bald spot and the history of recurrence. Diagnosis can be confirmed with skin biopsy if more confirmation is desired. Why Does this Happen? At the present time, no one knows why this occurs. It is felt to relate to the effects that the daylight cycle and light exposure have on the pineal gland. Shorter days seem to lead to a decrease in melatonin from the pineal gland, leading to skin change. Breed predisposition suggests a genetic factor as well. Dogs of any age can be affected, but the average age is about four years. Are There Treatment Options? Melatonin, a natural biochemical that is important in regulating circadian (daily) rhythms, has been used successfully in many patients. In the U.S., this product is available as an oral dietary supplement or as an implant for use under the skin. Oral Therapy Melatonin is sometimes used as a sleep aid in people, and the only known side effect is drowsiness. Dosing regimens must be obtained from the veterinarian treating your dog, but typically, oral melatonin is given 2-3 times daily. If the seasonal nature of the condition becomes predictable, it may be useful to begin the supplements a month or two before the hair loss is expected. It is important to realize that nutritional supplements are not regulated in the same way that prescription drugs are. This means that the manufacturer of a nutritional supplement is not required to prove that the product actually contains the amount of active ingredient it claims to have. A study on melatonin products from the University of Tennessee found tremendous variability in content among different brands. The most consistent and accurate brand was found to be Nature's Bounty, so this is the brand that most dermatologists recommend. Under Skin (Subcutaneous) Implant A more effective method involves the use of melatonin implants under the skin. These were not available in the U.S. until recently. A small implant the size of a grain of rice is implanted under the skin and between the shoulders much in the same way as a microchip ID. If hair regrows and it seems to work, a new implant can be inserted every 4-6 months. Some drowsiness can be a side effect for the first one to three days, and occasionally a sterile abscess forms at the site, necessitating removal. Seasonal flank alopecia is a cosmetic problem that is not harmful to the dog. It is not unreasonable to leave it untreated. Discuss these options with your veterinarian.

Category: Shar-Pei Recurrent Fever Syndrome
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Also called swollen hock syndrome, Shar-Pei auto-inflammatory disease (SPAID), or familial Shar-Pei fever syndrome (FSF). It would seem the Chinese Shar-Pei might have enough issues to contend with, given its potential for wrinkle-related skin and eyelid issues, but there is a special syndrome that every Shar-Pei owner needs to be familiar with: Recurrent Fever Syndrome. As the name implies, the syndrome is characterized by fevers that seem to arise out of nowhere, run their course, and may or may not be responsive to anti-inflammatory medications. The dog will feel bad during the fever episodes: listless and without appetite. Fevers typically last 12 to 36 hours and can go as high as 107ºF. Often the dog's ankles (hocks) become swollen during these episodes. It is normal for a Shar-Pei to have a large skin fold around the ankle called a sock; the swelling that occurs during the fever is different and only lasts during the fever. The muzzle may also swell and become painful, and sometimes there is some associated nausea or diarrhea. It is important to learn how to take your dog's temperature so you can monitor the situation. A fever of 106ºF is a medical emergency. It is good practice to know how to take your dog’s temperature, and it is especially important if your Shar-Pei seems listless. Normal canine body temperature is 100-102ºF. The fevers are unpleasant and can be dangerous if the fever rises to 106ºF, but what makes this syndrome a serious problem is the accompanying kidney damage. An abnormal protein called amyloid is laid down in the kidney, destroying the kidney's ability to filter protein. The valuable blood proteins are thus lost in urine along with waste chemicals. The dog becomes thin from the loss of body proteins, develops a propensity to throw abnormal blood clots throughout the body (from urinating out the proteins that would normally prevent this), and high blood pressure results. All Shar-Pei should be regularly screened for urinary protein loss with a urinalysis.Red flags include urinary protein and dilute urine (specific gravity less than 1.020). Why This Happens: Wrinkles Gone Wrong The characteristic skin wrinkles that make the Shar-Pei what it is are caused by excessive production of hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is a structural protein in everyone’s skin but a mutation in the Shar-Pei leads to multiple copies of the genes regulating the production of hyaluronan. The result is a whole lot of extra hyaluronan puffing up the skin and creating all the wrinkles that characterize this breed. All Shar-Pei have this mutation; without this mutation, the dog cannot really be a Shar-Pei but not all Shar-Peis have this mutation in the same way. Some have a mutation that leads to variable qualities of hyaluronan. In other words, not all the hyaluronan produced is of a healthy quality. Poor quality hyaluronan breaks down rapidly in a process that generates inflammation which, in turn, creates fever and damages organs. The mutation that creates all this poor-quality hyaluronan is often called the meat mouth mutation. It might seem that you could simply look at a Shar-Pei’s face to determine if the dog is a candidate for fever syndrome but the situation is more complicated. How do I Know if my Shar-Pei Has the Syndrome? A fever can develop in a Shar-Pei from a wound or other source of infection, just as it can in any other breed of dog. Some effort should be made to find another source of the fever and this generally requires a complete physical examination and some blood testing. As for screening tests, there is a genetic test available at Cornell University. The mutated genetic variant that creates the meat mouth appearance is typically in multiple copies within an affected Shar-Pei. The more copies the dog has, the more reactive the inflammation. The genetic test determines the number of mutated copies present and reports the "copy number variant." The higher this number, the more trouble for the dog. In the absence of a test, a diagnosis is made based on the clinical findings. One episode of fever is enough to make the diagnosis. Fevers classically begin before 18 months but can begin at any age. The test requires a blood sample and a six-page information form filled out by both the owner and the veterinary professional drawing the blood. A microchip number or tattoo is also required to confirm the patient's identity. Learn more abouttesting. During a fever episode, anti-inflammatory medications provided by your veterinarian can be used to control high fevers. Pain medication is often needed to control the discomfort during the episode. The real challenge, however, is to prevent kidney damage in the long term. A dog can have substantial kidney damage before the first fever episode even happens therefore, it is important to begin therapy after the first episode and to regularly screen for urinary protein loss in any Shar-Pei whether fevers have occurred or not. The medication central to preventing amyloid deposition in the kidney iscolchicine. Cell division, a process more scientifically known as mitosis, requires microscopic protein fibers acting like structural cables to pull dividing cells apart. These cables are called mitotic spindles, and colchicine interferes with their formation. The ability of colchicine to interfere with this sort of structural protein formation has led to its use in abnormal protein depositions such as amyloidosis. This means that colchicine can prevent the kidney damage that occurs in recurrent fever syndrome. Recently, legal issues have forced generic colchicine off the market, leaving only the brand-name product Colcrys®. This medication is problematically expensive for most pet owners. Colchicine can also be obtained through a compounding pharmacy, but a prescription is still necessary. The manufacturer of Colcrys®, Takeda®, has a patient assistance program called Help at Hand®. Dog owners may find out more information and apply by calling (800) 830-9159. Other Therapy Antioxidants are important in amyloid prevention in that they help preserve cell membrane fatty acids. Current recommendations include supplements in omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil) and a quality multivitamin. Antioxidants such as vitamin C, lecithin granules, and glucosamine supplements to improve the hyaluronan quality are also recommended. Consult your veterinarian for a specific protocol for your dog. Early intervention is the goal of this condition. Herbal antioxidants have also been recommended. Normalizing proper hyaluronan metabolism may require magnesium supplementation.

Category: Strangles in Puppies
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Also called juvenile cellulitis or sterile granulomatous dermatitis and lymphadenitis Puppy strangles is a classical disease though fortunately not a common one. It comes up suddenly, manifesting as marked swelling of the muzzle, eyelids, and face in a puppy between the ages of 3 weeks and 6 months of age. The owner may be inclined to think the puppy was bitten by a stinging insect or a spider. Soon the lymph nodes of the throat become spectacularly enlarged, giving the puppy the appearance of having the mumps. It doesn’t take long for the swelling to give way to pimples that rupture, bleed, and crust. The inner surface of the ear flaps are commonly involved as well and occasionally lesions in other body areas occur. Lesions are painful more than they are itchy. Fever, joint swelling, and loss of appetite occur in approximately 25 percent of patients. If treatment is delayed, permanent hair loss can result in the most severely affected areas. If the puppy is sick enough, the condition can be life-threatening. Predisposed breeds include the Golden Retriever, Dachshund, and Gordon Setter. Treatment Despite the extreme inflammation and secondary infections, the heart of treatment for this condition is immune-suppression. High doses of corticosteroids such asprednisoneare needed as this condition is an immune-mediated disease and no specific underlying cause has been identified. In other words, the puppy’s immune system is acting excessively and inappropriately and it must be subdued. Antibiotics may be needed for the secondary infections but antibiotics alone will not treat this condition. Once suppression of the overly active immune system occurs, improvement is usually rapid. Puppies with strangles have a fairly characteristic appearance and are usually diagnosed on that basis. That said, because the treatment involves suppressing the immune system, it is best to rule out conditions that might look similar but for which immune suppression would be inappropriate.Generalized demodectic mange, an infection involving mange mites, also has a facial orientation and can look similar to juvenile cellulitis. Skin scrapes can be performed to check for the presence of mites. A skin biopsy should settle any questions about what condition is present. A severe infection can be ruled out by looking at samples of the pimple contents under the microscope, noting that no bacteria are present despite the dramatic number of inflammatory cells. A secondary infection, though, can be present in which case the doctor must use clinical judgment about the appearance of the lesions and the patient’s history to make the diagnosis. The condition generally resolves in 10 to 14 days and does not recur.

Category: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a fairly rare chronic and potentially-fatal autoimmune disease. The dog’s immune system fights itself by forming antibodies that “protect” it against its own cells and tissues. This results in inflammation and tissue damage in the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, joints, nervous system, or blood. Usually several organs are affected. SLE can be managed, but not cured. While the disease itself is chronic, signs can be acute, chronic, or both. Lifelong treatment is necessary. It is different fromdiscoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), which is a skin disease. The word lupus is Latin for “wolf.” (Some humans get a facial rash that has a slight similarity with a wolf’s face.) Breeds that most typically are affected by SLE include Afghan Hounds, Beagles, German Shepherd Dogs, Irish Setters, Old English Sheepdogs, Poodles, Rough Collies, and Shetland Sheepdogs. Dogs are usually middle-aged when they get SLE. Females are not more likely than males to get SLE. The most common significant signs of SLE are a non-erosive polyarthritis (an arthritis that affects several joints), painful muscles; shifting lameness; skin sores and blisters; proteinuria (protein in the urine); decreased platelet and white blood cell count; fluctuating fevers, andimmune mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). Some less-significant signs are mouth ulcers, inflamed lining of the chest cavity or heart, dementia, swollen lymph nodes, and seizures. Usually, dogs with SLE are first taken to the veterinarian because of the skin problems or lameness. Blood tests are needed for diagnosis. While all dogs won’t have the same signs, dogs with SLE typically test positive for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA). There are so many effects of this multi-systemic disease that it’s hard to rule any one disease in or out. Diagnosis is typically made using a combination of a positive ANA test with at least two significant signs. A positive ANA test, with one significant sign plus two less-significant signs is also indicative of SLE. (SLE can be suspected if there is only one significant sign plus positive ANA, or if there are two significant signs with a negative ANA test.) It can be difficult to make a positive diagnosis since other problems, such as drug reactions and cancer, can have many of the same signs. (ANA can be positive with any chronic inflammatory disease, so if there are no other consistent pathologic or clinical signs, your veterinarian may suspect a false-positive ANA.) Treatment is aimed at decreasing the inflammation and autoimmune activity, so treatment centers around anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive medications such as corticosteroids (e.g.prednisone). Sometimes a second immunosuppressant, such asazathioprine,cyclophosphamide, orcyclosporinewill be necessary. Specific problems, such as kidney or spleen damage, will also have to be treated. Treatment plans depend on what organs are affected. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight can cause flare-ups of SLE, so exposure to sunlight should be limited. Prognosis depends entirely on how each dog is affected, but owners can expect that their pets will require life-long treatment. Unfortunately, sometimes the damage caused by this disease can result in death.

Category: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-Like Syndrome in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called Uveodermatologic Syndrome) True VKH syndrome is a human disease, well described for nearly a century. A similar disease in dogs has been described but since we do not know the relationship between the canine and human disease, we are hesitant to call the canine version VKH syndrome as well. Until we know what is really going on in dogs, we will leave it at VKH-LIKE syndrome or, more accurately, uveodermatologic syndrome. A syndrome is a collection of symptoms. In humans, VKH syndrome consists of the following: Affected people are typically of Mediterranean, Hispanic or Asian descent. There are numerous links for more information regardingthis condition in humans. The syndrome in dogs includes: Unlike the human disease, deafness or meningitis is not a feature. The most detrimental part of the syndrome is blindness. What Causes this Syndrome? Uveodermatologic syndrome is an immune-mediated disease where the body inappropriately attacks its own melanocytes (the pigment-producing cells). These cells seem most prevalent in the skin, retina, and uveal tract of the eye. It is speculated that the immune reaction is initially triggered by a virus though research is ongoing. How is the Diagnosis Made? The best way to confirm this diagnosis is by a skin biopsy (the lip is said to be the best location). Treatment, however, is focused on the eye disease as this has the most serious outcome ‒ blindness ‒ while skin disease is generally cosmetic. Uveitis is most literally inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye. The uveal tract consists of the iris (the colored portion), the ciliary body (the area inside from which the lens is suspended), and the choroid (the vascular coating of the inside). The treatment for uveitis due to a VKH-like syndrome is the same as for other causes of uveitis. Thanks to the Animal Ophthalmology Clinic, Ltd. for these pictures. See the completecase studyof Sheila. Treatment Uveitis, whether it is caused by VKH-like immune-mediated inflammation or something else, is treated by suppressing the inflammation. This means corticosteroids (such asprednisone) are taken orally as well as topically. VKH-like syndrome will require ongoing immune suppression to prevent blindness and sincelong-term steroid useis undesirable therapy often switches toazathioprine,cyclosporine, or some other stronger immunomodulating agent. Topical therapy is also necessary; steroid-containing eye drops or injections of steroids into the conjunctival membranes are commonly used.With aggressive treatment, some dogs are able to regain some vision but in general, vision cannot be preserved and a more realistic goal is to control the eye pain. Blind dogs still have a good quality of life as long as the pain is controlled. A 2018 study published in the JAVMA by Zarfoss et. al., reviewed 50 dogs with uveodermatologic syndrome. At the initial evaluation, 36% of dogs had glaucoma (increased eye pressure) and 57% were blind in both eyes. Some dogs were able to regain vision and 50% of subjects could see in at least one eye at the end of the study. Of the dogs that ultimately became blind in both eyes, blindness came on over 13.5 months (median). At least 10 eyes had to be removed in order to provide long-term comfort. For more information on living with a blind dog, seeBlinddogs.netorPetfinders.

Category: Von Willebrand's Disease in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most people are familiar with hemophilia A, an inherited blood clotting defect in human beings affecting only male children. Most people, however, are not as familiar with von Willebrand's disease and hear of it for the first time when they ask questions about breeding their dog. Von Willebrand's disease, like hemophilia A, is an inherited blood clotting defect and breeds at high risk should be screened before being allowed to breed. Breeds routinely tested are Doberman Pinscher, Golden Retriever, Shetland Sheepdog, Rottweiler, Miniature Schnauzer, German Shepherd, German Short-Haired Pointer, Standard Poodle, and Scottish Terrier. What is Von Willebrand's Factor? Von Willebrand's factor is a protein complex produced both by platelets (the blood cells involved in clotting) and by the cells lining blood vessels. It is made up of several smaller proteins bound together. Von Willebrand's disease results when there is a defect in any one of these proteins. When a blood vessel tears and bleeding occurs, platelets are called to the area to clump upon each other, thus plugging up the hole and staunching the bleeding. While the platelets are in place, a cascade of blood clotting factors activates, ultimately leading to the production of fibrin (the material scars are made of) to more permanently seal the vessel. Von Willebrand's factor acts as the glue holding the platelets together and holding them onto the surface of the torn blood vessel. Von Willebrand's factor also serves to stabilize clotting factor VIII, one of the proteins involved in forming the fibrin clot. See a short video depicting thenormal blood clotting system. When there is something wrong with a body's von Willebrand's factor, platelets do not stick together properly and inappropriate, prolonged wound bleeding occurs.  Bleeding can be noted in association with minor injury or surgery but can also manifest as spontaneous bleeding, especially recurring nose bleeds, bloody urine, and/or black tarry diarrhea. Types of Von Willebrand's Disease There are three types of von Willebrand's disease. Type IIn Type I von Willebrand's disease, all the proteins making up von Willebrand's factor are present but only in very small amounts. This is the type common in the Doberman Pinscher, the Shetland Sheepdog, the German Shepherd Dog, and the Standard Poodle. Type IIIn Type II, the larger proteins making up von Willebrand's factor are completely absent, leaving only the smaller proteins to do the job. This creates more severe bleeding episodes and represents the type of von Willebrand's disease usually seen in German Short-Haired and German Wire-Haired Pointers. Type IIIIn Type III, there is simply no von Willebrand's factor at all. This is the most severe form and is usually seen in Scottish Terriers, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, and Shetland Sheepdogs. Von Willebrand's disease is not limited to the breeds listed here; forms of it have been found in over 50 breeds, as well as in cats and humans. Unlike the genetics of Hemophilia A in humans, which is reviewed in detail in virtually every high school biology class as an example of a classic sex-linked recessive trait, von Willebrand's disease is not as simple. Males and females are equally affected and the inheritance seems to be recessive but complicated. Testing for Von Willebrand's Factor Knowing a dog's von Willebrand's status is important clinically when there is concern about a patient's ability to clot, and it’s also important before breeding.  With breeding, it is important to identify genetic carriers of von Willebrand's. A carrier of von Willebrand's should under no circumstances be bred to another carrier as this is likely to create affected dogs, so members of the classically affected breeds should be screened. There is great controversy as to whether carriers should even be bred at all, as this will potentially create more carriers. Classically, testing for this disease is accomplished by measuring von Willebrand's factor in a blood sample. The amount of factor in the patient's serum is compared to that found in "normal" dogs. The patient's results are compared to the normal and expressed in a percentage, thus, it is possible for a patient to have greater than 100 percent. Normal is considered to be 70-180 percent. Borderline is considered to be 50-69 percent. Abnormal (affected or genetic carrier) is considered to be less than 49% though these results, in part, depend on the laboratory running the test. Dogs in the "abnormal" group are at risk for bleeding and should definitely not be bred. A dog may test differently on different days, when blood is drawn from different veins, when the dog is more excited, or if the dog is pregnant, so it may be necessary to test a dog several times before being comfortable with the result. This type of testing does not indicate what type of von Willebrand's disease the dog has and further testing by a technique called electrophoresis is needed to do this if you are interested. Knowing the type of von Willebrand's disease is unlikely to change therapy, thus, further testing is not commonly done. DNA TestingDNA testing is currently available for many von Willebrand's breeds. At present, there are many DNA testing labs throughout the U.S. and Europe that can test for von Willebrand's disease. Typically, the pet owner receives a test kit that can be used at home and instructions on how to collect a cheek swab from the dog's mouth.  Results should indicate if the patient is clear, affected, or if the patient is a carrier. Testing Clotting Ability Prior to Planned Surgery A simple screening test often done before surgery is a buccal bleeding time. A small wound is created in the mouth using a spring-loaded blade created just for this purpose (a Symplate device or Surgicutt device). The time required for clotting to occur is measured and should be under four minutes or so if platelet function is normal. The patient is generally under anesthesia at this point. The test has previously been accomplished by clipping a toenail short and inducing bleeding, but this technique has largely been abandoned as there are too many toenail variables to create a standardized test. That said, there are some issues with buccal bleeding time as well. Even though the spring load is standardized, as is the length and sharpness of the instrument, there is still some subjectivity in positioning the device, as well as some patient variables (red blood cell concentration, blood viscosity, etc.) that can influence results. In a perfect world, a platelet function analyzer is used to measure what is called a collagen/ADP closure time. This is the most accurate measurement of how well platelets adhere and form clots, but this technology is not readily available to most small animal hospitals at this time. Suddenly Symptoms? You would expect a congenital disease like von Willebrand's disease to manifest in puppyhood, and in fact, this is usually so. Von Willebrand's disease is usually detected when there is unexpected hemorrhage during a spay or neuter or when screening tests are done in anticipation of surgery on a member of a von Willebrand's breed. It is possible for borderline dogs to show signs of bleeding later on. For example, a dog with borderline von Willebrand's factor might become hypothyroid later in life, and this hormonal change could be just enough to make the bleeding disorder clinically evident. This is not a common scenario with hypothyroidism, but it has been reported. Treatment of the Affected Dog When hemorrhage is occurring or is anticipated, as with a planned surgical procedure, the best treatment is the administration of von Willebrand's factor by transfusion. Pure von Willebrand's factor cannot be purchased from a blood bank but a blood product called cryoprecipitate, which is particularly rich in von Willebrand's factor, can be. Complete plasma is the next best choice and is much more available than cryoprecipitate. Administration of cryoprecipitate improves bleeding time for approximately 4 hours after administration. A hormone called DDAVP (or desmopressin acetate) can be helpful as its use seems to cause a sudden release of von Willebrand's factor into the bloodstream. After a 30-minute activation period, the use of DDAVP shortens the bleeding time for approximately 2 hours after the DDAVP injection. This is very helpful in preparing for surgery but not something useful on a day-to-day basis. There are two considerations with von Willebrand’s disease: screening breeding animals so that this genetic disorder is not passed on and identifying and treating affected animals. If you have one of the at-risk breeds, consider having a screening test, especially if you are considering a major surgery. If you plan to breed your pet, von Willebrand’s testing is a good idea regardless of the breed, but it is a special concern for at-risk breeds. If you have questions, your veterinarian’s office will be happy to answer them.

Category: Breast Cancer Happens in Companion Animals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Print an 8.5"x11" pdf of this poster. Everyone reading this is a mammal (unless you are a particularly sentient anemone, coelacanth or axolotl), and one of the things that pegs us as mammals and unites us all is…well, boobs. Yes, even the men and boys. Boob-bearers, all of us. Let me explain. But it still seems to shock people to learn that dogs, cats, rabbits, rats and a host of other domestic species can get breast cancer, too. Since the aim of Breast Cancer Awareness Month is to raise awareness, our aim here is to wave the flag for those who can’t speak for themselves and raise awareness of mammary cancer in companion animals. We also want people to know that breast cancer and mammary gland cancer are the same disease; it’s just called by a different name in other species. Check out the poster we created for use in veterinary hospitals that we hope will help pet owners understand that they're the same.As a pre-amble ‒ and the way this is going it could be a "pre-ramble" ‒ October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I think people are fairly keyed in to the fact that humans can get breast cancer, or mammary cancer, as it is called in companion animals; its gnarled and potentially deadly hand has touched the lives of many of you, I presume. My own mother had surgery to have a tumor removed that was, luckily, low grade. Some numbers may help to illustrate the risks to dogs and cats. For humans, breast cancer happens more frequently in more developed countries, and accounts for about 10 percent of all deaths in women between 20 and 59 (source: World Health Organization). Data for dogs and cats and other domestic species are harder to come by as there is no World Doggy Health Organization database to be accessed as easily as WHO data, but estimates are that 1 in 4 dogs who are not spayed and experience more than one heat cycle will develop mammary tumors. Those stakes are high enough that Vegas would avoid this bet like the plague. Happily, for dogs or cats who are spayed before they are sexually mature (the usual timeframe for a spay is before 6 months of age) mammary cancer is virtually unheard of. Learn more about the specifics of the disease and treatment indogsandcats. The terminology surrounding lumps, tumors and cancer can be a little daunting sometimes, and is often a source of confusion. One thing to keep in mind is that the word tumor does not always mean cancer. Cancer implies malignancy, or a predilection to grow rapidly and spread to other parts of the body: it’s a process known as metastasis, in which a tumor says, in essence, I’m outta here and decides to infiltrate new and exciting regions for growth. A tumor can be benign or malignant, but cancer is always malignant. So how do we know which lump is bad, and which is not likely to be a problem for our pets? Sadly, there’s no easy way. Any lump found on a pet’s mammary gland has the potential to be cancerous, so having your veterinarian remove the lump (or a piece of it, in what is known as an incisional biopsy) and submit it for analysis is an important part of keeping your pets safe from this disease. A biopsy is a piece of tissue that can be preserved and looked at under a microscope by a pathologist to determine what the lump is (mammary tissue vs. some other tissue that just decided on a whim to form a lump) and whether the lump is cancerous, or as doctors call it, malignant. You can’t tell if tissue is cancerous just by the way it looks, how it feels or where it is.There is one intermediate step that can offer information to your veterinarian on how extensive or radical surgery to remove the lump should be. This is known as a fine needle aspirate, or FNA. With an FNA, you don’t get a piece of the mass, you just suck some cells up into the needle and place them onto a slide. It is much less invasive and doesn’t usually require any sedation or anesthesia, but the trade-off is that it is a less accurate test and less likely than a surgical biopsy to tell you the badness level of the tumor. An FNA is actually notoriously unreliable for mammary masses as far as predicting malignancy but can help make sure the lump is from mammary tissue and not something else that set up shop in the same area. Medicine is often like that – the invasive stuff is the most accurate, and the easiest stuff gives you the least useable information. It’s like food where the good stuff tastes bad and the stuff that tastes great kills you.  The universe can seem like a vast, cruel joke some days. I know this sounds complex, intimidating and potentially invasive – not to mention expensive. The good news is that the take-home on this is pretty simple: spay your pet before she goes into heat, unless you have a rock-solid breeding plan for your purebred pet, and have your veterinarian check out any suspicious lumps. That’s about it. Luckily, your trusted family veterinarian has the skills and knowledge to guide you and your pet through this maze to ensure the highest degree of success.

Category: Cancer is a Cellular Delinquent
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Like people, our pets’ bodies develop cancer cells throughout their lifetime. In the lucky ones, these cells remain dormant and no malignancy ever grows; in others, the cells go mad systematically. The cellular delinquents bust past the body’s natural immune system, as though a gate was left open, burgeoning into abnormal cells. They do not surrender to a healthy cell’s programmed death, so the cellular delinquents multiply as they crowd out healthy cells. They don’t follow any rules and ignore signals that they are overfilling the place. For nourishment, they cause new blood vessels to form to supply them, which should be supplying healthy tissue. These marauding delinquents can grow anywhere in our pets’ bodies, just like us: lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, intestines, bone, blood, brain, skin, muscle, mouth, nail beds, and so on. What signs of cancer can we look for in our pets? They range from subtle to more obvious that something is going wrong. Signs of cancer can be similar to ones seen in other diseases, so don’t assume your pet has cancer if you see one. Also don’t assume that age alone is causing lethargy or lack of playfulness. If your pet has one or more of these signs, it’s time for a visit to the veterinarian: catching any disease process early is best because it’s easier to treat.  With cancer, early detection can sometimes make the difference between good health at a reasonable cost and an expensive illness that may include death.

Category: Effects of Spay and Neuter Timing on Cancer in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Even though veterinary recommendations forspayingandneuteringpets have become common and there is a lot of information available about its benefits, you may have questions or concerns about how it could affect your dog long term. You may also wonder if there is a correct age for spaying and neutering since recommendations seem to vary. This issue has been studied but there are no general recommendations because the decision is based on multiple factors. Here we explore the issues and emphasize that it is always best to consult your veterinarian regarding the best timing for your individual pet.       Decreased Mammary Cancer Besides the behavioral benefits seen with spaying and neutering, most studies cited for spaying dogs before their first heat emphasize the decreased risk of mammary gland tumors (both benign and malignant cancers). Several studies have concluded that female dogs are significantly less likely to develop mammary tumors when they are spayed and timing of the surgery relative to the dog's age makes a difference. The most protective effects were found with female dogs spayed prior to their first heat. Other Cancers On the other hand, there have been studies cited that discuss increased risk of other cancers when dogs are spayed young. These studies were done on a small number of relatively young dogs. Since the average age of diagnosis for mammary tumors is over 8 years, studies that looked at rates in younger dogs were unlikely to show the true incidence. These studies also examined the risk of other cancers developing, but they may have falsely exaggerated a non-existent effect, since studies with a relatively small group size are much more likely to be affected by chance. Another study found that age, not sexual status or timing of desexing, determined the probability of Golden Retrievers dying from cancer. This topic is complicated since the evidence is still inconsistent and contradictory from study to study. As a pet owner, you may be looking for concrete statements for or against desexing your pet, or regarding the timing of desexing. Various cancers have seemed more prevalent in desexed animals in some studies, but not in others, which makes it difficult to give concrete, unbiased recommendations. For example, the risk of osteosarcoma, mast cell tumor, lymphoma, urogenital cancer, and hemangiosarcoma may (or may not) increase when dogs are desexed prior to one year. Most of these studies are small (which can lead to inaccurate results) and many of the studies with these conclusions did not control for breeds predisposed to cancers, which they and others have identified as independent risk factors. Breed Specific Spay/Neuter Age Guidelines An analysis of multiple breeds was done by Hart and colleagues at UC Davis in 2020, and breed-specific guidelines for spay/neuter age were published. Critics of the breed-specific guidelines for spay/neuter age found the study to be problematic based on their methods, groupings, and means of applying analysis differently to different breeds. Although suggested guidelines for age of desexing of each breed examined were provided, the study did conclude that in most breeds examined, the risk of developing problems was not affected by age of neutering. Spayed/Neutered Dogs and Lifespans After reading this, you may be concerned that neutering or spaying your dog will cause long-term problems. However, it is important to note that multiple studies have looked at the impact of desexing on mortality from all causes and determined that desexed male and female dogs actually do have slightly longer median lifespans than their intact counterparts. Intact females had shorter lifespans than all other genders, and spayed females lived the longest. Even in a study that specifically looked at Golden Retrievers diagnosed with cancer, the spayed females lived longer than intact females. The best timing for spaying or neutering your pet may depend on other factors specific to your situation, such as your dog's behavioral tendencies (roaming, marking, aggression), environmental factors (housing, fencing, space), and the legal requirements of the jurisdiction where you live.This continues to be an evolving topic with many considerations. The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) issued reproductive control guidelines in 2024 that challenged traditional thinking regarding spaying and neutering and prompted varied reactions from veterinarians, particularly in the sheltering community.As with any medical decision, your best resource for determining the appropriate timing of spaying/neutering is your pet's veterinarian.

Category: Hemangiopericytoma in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The hemangiopericytoma is a common tumor in dogs, usually arising on the limbs and appearing as a round nodule under the skin. It derives from a cell called a pericyte that acts to support blood vessel capillaries throughout the body (see below). A hemangiopericytoma develops when a pericyte somewhere in the body develops a chromosomal abnormality (either a missing chromosome or an extra one) and begins to proliferate and invade other local tissues.  The hemangiopericytoma is classified as a type of soft tissue sarcoma and is considered malignant because of its ability to invade and obliterate local tissues; however, it rarely spreads to distant body sites. Hemangiopericytomas can appear bald, pigmented, or even ulcerated. In later stages, the hemangiopericytoma can be quite large and is sometimes mistaken for a benignlipoma(fatty tumor) if tests are not performed. What is a Pericyte? Consider that everyone began life as a single cell. This cell divided over and over and became many cells. As time continued, we became groups of different types of cells. Eventually, we became embryos, fetuses, and finally infants with complete organ systems and different tissues all derived from one original cell. During the course of this amazing development, some cells do not specialize fully in specific tissues. They stay "undifferentiated" and can in the future specialize into whatever type of cell our body might require at that time. We have cells throughout our bodies that simply stay put at different stages of embryonic development. Pericytes are such cells. They have arrested their development from embryonic times and are located all over the body, supporting blood vessels and waiting for a signal to develop. If the body has a need, pericytes can develop into new muscle tissue or new blood vessel tissue. A pathology instructor once described the pericyte as perhaps not the Adam and Eve of our bodies but more like Abraham: not the first or even second generation by any means, but ancient. What is a Hemangiopericytoma? A hemangiopericytoma is a tumor arising from pericytes associated with blood vessels. Instead of forming a useful tissue, these pericytes form tumors because improper cell division leaves them with chromosome damage. Is it Cancer? The hemangiopericytoma does not spread through the body in the way you normally think of cancer. It does, however, tend to recur at its original site. When it recurs, it tends to grow back more deeply rooted and more difficult to remove than it was originally. If left alone it will continue to grow inexorably, usually over years, until it invades a part of the body that does not have extra space to allow a tumor; usually, the chest cavity is the closest such area. What Are the Treatment Options? Treatment centers around local tumor control, and this usually means surgery. The hemangiopericytoma has microscopic tentacles, making it hard to remove completely. Plus, the fact that it is a blood vessel tumor means that bleeding can be intense and difficult to control.  The goal is to remove as much of the tumor as possible without risk. The first step involves some sort of biopsy, either an attempt at removing the whole tumor or simply a mission to take a small piece and identify the tumor depending on the tumor size and amount of bleeding encountered. Once the growth is confirmed as hemangiopericytoma and the bulk of the tumor has been removed, the focus becomes slowing its growth and preventing recurrence. Here are the options after the initial surgery. Effective (sometimes called "definitive") radiation therapy, unfortunately, requires 15-18 treatments, and the total cost can easily run $4000-$4500. For radiotherapy to be effective, the tumor must first be surgically removed, leaving no visible remaining tumor. Otherwise, the tumor will be too big for a definitive response. If the goal is not to cure the tumor but to simply slow its recurrence, palliative radiation is an option. This costs substantially less and typically involves a month of weekly treatments. This might not be able to prevent regrowth but could certainly postpone it. Given that the tumor is slow growing to begin with, postponing regrowth might be as good as a definitive response. What about Inoperable Tumors? Some tumors are just too big, are located in a body area not amenable to surgery, or the patient has concurrent problems that make surgery problematic. If surgery is not practical, there are still treatment options to consider: Not all veterinarians are comfortable treating a hemangiopericytoma. Discuss with your veterinarian whether a referral to a specialist would be best for you and your pet.

Category: Lymphocytic Leukemia in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English See article summary below. Most of us have heard of leukemia and know it is a kind of cancer that people commonly get. We know it is generally a serious and often fatal disease. This article explains what leukemia is in dogs, and why it is bad; it also reviews the most common forms of leukemia for dogs, called the lymphocytic forms. Leukemia is a word describing exactly what it is: “Leuk” means white (in this case white blood cells) and “emia” means blood. Leukemia means “white blood” or more specifically an over-abundance of white blood cells in the bloodstream. Now, white blood cell counts go up in response to infection, inflammation, allergy, and even stress. We are not talking about elevations in these ranges. The patient with leukemia has an over-abundance of a particular white blood cell but in magnitudes so great that it is amazing that the change cannot be seen with the naked eye. The bloodstream is swarmed with cancerous white blood cells, and the bone marrow from whence they came is consumed with making cancer cells and making very few of the other blood cells needed to survive. In the case of lymphocytic leukemia, the cancer cells are of lymphocyte origin, though there are many other types of leukemia, potentially one for every type of blood cell made by the bone marrow. In this article, we only discuss lymphocytic leukemias. What Causes Lymphocytic Leukemia? In dogs, we do not have much of a list of possibilities though in other species some culprits have been identified. It may be that these same factors are causes in dogs as well. In humans, radiation exposure had been linked to lymphocytic leukemia development as has exposure to benzene. In cats, birds, and cattle there is a “leukemia virus” (though not the same virus for these different animals). Not surprisingly, given the name, leukemia viruses cause leukemia as well as other lymphocytic cancers such aslymphoma. Chronic Versus Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia In most of these patients, the diagnosis of lymphocytic leukemia is clear when an impossibly high lymphocyte count is seen. A normal lymphocyte count is generally less than 3,500 cells per microliter. In lymphocytic leukemias, lymphocyte counts over 100,000 are common.Numbers of this magnitude generally flag the sample at the reference laboratory for reading by a clinical pathologist (or if the initial testing is done in the veterinarian’s office, the lymphocyte reading will cause the sample to be submitted for further analysis). The pathologist will then review the slide visually for signs of malignancy within the cells. The diagnosis of lymphocytic leukemia is usually fairly obvious (for exceptions see below) but the key is to determine whether the lymphocytic leukemia is chronic or acute. Normally the term chronic means a process or disease has been going on for a long time and acute means that the process started suddenly. For lymphocytic leukemia, these terms have a different meaning: they refer to how mature the cancer cells look. Lymphocytes develop from precursor cells in the bone marrow or lymph nodes and undergo several stages of development before they are released into the bloodstream. When a leukemia involves earlier stages of lymphocytes, it is said to be an acute leukemia. When cells are more developed, the patient is said to have a chronic leukemia. As a general rule, the acute leukemias act more malignantly than the chronic ones. There is some controversy over whether acute or chronic lymphocytic leukemia is more common. Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) ALL (acute lymphocytic leukemia) involves the obliteration of the bone marrow by immature lymphocytes called lymphoblasts, or simply blasts. When 30 percent of the bone marrow cell population consists of blast lymphocytes, ALL is confirmed. In 90% of patients, the blast cells spill out into the circulating blood where they can be detected in a blood sample. The lymphoblast cell is the hallmark cell of ALL. The most common symptoms include: listlessness, poor appetite, nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss. The average age at diagnosis is only 6.2 years with 27 percent of patients being under age 4 years. Over 70 percent of patients have enlarged spleens due to cancer infiltration, over 50 percent have enlarged livers, and 40-50 percent have lymph node enlargement (though this last is not dramatic). On lab tests, over 50 percent will have anemia (red blood cell deficiency), 30-50 percent will have a platelet deficiency (platelets are blood clotting cells so deficiency can lead to spontaneous bleeding), and 65 percent have what is called neutropenia. Neutrophils are white blood cells that serve as the immune system’s first line of defense. Neutropenia is a neutrophil deficiency that leaves the patient vulnerable to infection. Pets with ALL are generally very sick and require aggressive chemotherapy. Often they need blood transfusions because of the severe anemia or antibiotics to make up for the neutropenia. Typical chemotherapy protocols include:prednisone,vincristine,cyclophosphamide,L-asparaginase, anddoxorubicin.Still, even with aggressive chemotherapy only 30 percent of patients achieve remission, and with no therapy most patients die within a few weeks. Prognosis is poor when ALL is diagnosed so it is important to distinguish ALL from lymphoma or from more treatable forms of leukemia. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) As rapid and aggressive as acute lymphocytic leukemia is, chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the opposite with most patients having few symptoms and long survival times. The clinical course of CLL is long, lasting months to years, with the average age at diagnosis being 10 to 12 years. In up to 50 percent of cases there are no symptoms of any kind at the time of diagnosis, and the leukemia is discovered by chance on a routine blood evaluation. In CLL, it is the sheer number of circulating cells rather than what they look like is what makes the diagnosis. There are three forms of CLL: T cell (called T-CLL), B cell (called B-CLL), and a form involving both B and T cells (called atypical CLL). T-cell and B-cell are the most common forms. T-CLL has the best prognosis overall, although many factors can affect a patient’s outcome. The type of CLL that a given patient has can be determined by blood testing (immunophenotyping or PARR testing, which stands for PCR testing for antigen receptor rearrangements), thus revealing the most information regarding prognosis and what to expect. Because CLL progresses slowly, treatment is often forgone unless one of several conditions exist. Conditions for which treatment of CLL is recommended include: lymphocyte counts are greater than 60,000; if there are symptoms or organ enlargement; hyperviscosity syndrome (more common with B-CLL, see below); or if other white blood cell lines are suppressed by the tumor. If treatment is deemed necessary, common protocols involveprednisone,chlorambucil,vincristine, and/orcyclophosphamide. Survival times of one to three years with good life quality are common. Golden Retrievers and German Shepherd dogs may be predisposed to CLL. Boxers, unfortunately, tend to get a more aggressive form of this condition and have much shorter survival times. What else Could it Be? In most cases, the diagnosis is fairly obvious but not always. In early cases, the lymphocyte count may not have climbed to its ultimate level so the diagnosis may be unclear. Similarly, in late stages the bone marrow may be so damaged that it can no longer turn out many cells at all. In these cases, tests may be needed because when lymphocytic leukemia is ambiguous, there are other diseases that must be ruled out: What is a Monoclonal Gammopathy? What is Hyperviscosity Syndrome? Antibodies are members of a group of blood proteins called gamma globulins. When an infection occurs, B-cell lymphocytes begin to produce antibodies. Not all B-cell lymphocytes produce antibodies, only the ones that recognize the infectious organism. Each activated lymphocyte will divide over and over with all the daughter cells ultimately producing antibodies against a specific portion of the infectious agent. Each member of a line of daughter cells is called a clone and, when all is said and done, there are many clonal lines each producing their own unique antibody. The gamma globulin levels in the bloodstream are high because of all the antibodies there but because many clonal lines are involved, there are many antibody shapes. This type of gamma globulin elevation is called a polyclonal gammopathy and generally indicates immune stimulation or infection. Lymphocyte cancer is not like an infection. Infection stimulates many lymphocyte clones to divide, but cancer stems from one single cell gone wrong. There is only a clonal line involved. If that clonal line is an antibody-producing lymphocyte line, then only one antibody is produced. The gamma globulin levels still rise but there is only one antibody shape. This is called a monoclonal gammopathy because only one single line of daughter cells participates. This is an unusual way for antibodies to be produced and the list of conditions that can stimulate only one clonal line like this is short: The reason why monoclonal gammopathy is bad is because it can cause hyperviscosity syndrome. Antibodies are blood proteins, and if enough blood protein is circulated, the blood thickens. Smaller blood vessels are too delicate to circulate thickened blood. They break and bleeding results. What symptoms occur depend on where these small vessels bleed. There could be nose bleeds, seizures, blurred vision, or even blindness. In one study, monoclonal gammopathy was common in dogs with CLL. Antibodies, also called immunoglobulins, are classified into different types: IgG, IgA, IgE, IgM, and IgD. Monoclonal gammopathy from CLL is almost always of the IgM type, while monoclonal gammopathy from Ehrlichia infection produces IgG antibodies. Lymphocytic leukemia is a cancer that not all veterinarians are comfortable treating. Discuss with your veterinarian whether referral to a specialist would be best for you and your pet.

Category: Lymphoma
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Lymphoma, also called lymphosarcoma, is a highly malignant tumor of the lymph system.It is one of the most common forms of cancer in both humans and small animals. Presumably you are here because your pet is suspected of having this form of cancer. Perhaps the diagnosis has already been confirmed. In either case, you want to know more and there turns out to be much more to know. Because lymphoma is a common form of cancer in humans, research and new development in this area abounds. Animal patients as well as human patients have benefitted from this research. What is the Lymph System? The lymph system is a network of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes through which foreign proteins and disease organisms are circulated. The lymph nodes serve as processing centers where these foreign substances may be presented to the cells of the immune system. There are many different types of immune-related cells; some produce antibodies, some circulate and destroy the foreign materials they encounter, and some regulate the activity of other cells. Lymphocytes are the primary cells of the lymph system and they act in the various ways mentioned. The lymph vessels serve as a circulatory path for lymphocytes in addition to serving as a collection system directing foreign substances toward the lymph nodes. Lymph vessels interface with the blood stream at several areas allowing lymphocytes greater area to patrol. In many ways, the lymph system is similar to a second circulatory system in the body, one that circulates lymph fluid instead of blood. What is Cancer? Cancer occurs when a normal cell “goes wrong.” The cell’s normal regulatory processes disengage and it begins to divide quickly and without control. These cells do not stop at barriers, nor do they stop growing when they outgrow their own blood supply. They divide over and over, taking over local tissues and escaping to spread to other body areas. The organ to which the original cell belonged is destroyed as the cancer cells obliterate its structure. Other local tissues may also become invaded as the tumor cells grow inexorably into them. Cancer cells break off the primary tumor and travel via blood or lymph vessels to new areas of the body. Wherever these cells lodge, they may start new tumors far from the original tumor but just as deadly. This process continues until there is not enough normal tissue left to sustain life. This form of cancer spread is called metastasis. What is Lymphoma? When lymphocytes become cancerous within a lymph node, the node swells and hardens. Malignant lymphocytes readily travel through the lymph vessels to other nearby lymph nodes. When nearby nodes have been infiltrated, the cancerous lymphocytes continue their journey through the lymphatic system to distant lymph nodes. Soon all the nodes are enlarged. Other organs that harbor lymph tissues (liver, spleen and even the GI tract) can become infiltrated. Ultimately, the bone marrow, where most blood cells are formed, is affected, the immune system is destroyed, and severe anemia and weakness claim the victim's life. Without treatment, animals with lymphoma are expected to live 4-8 weeks from the time of diagnosis. Most patients (especially dogs) are not feeling particularly sick at the time of diagnosis. It may be tempting to hold off on treatment until the pet seems more ill. Waiting can drastically reduce the chance for long-term survival; better remission quality is obtained if the patient is treated while he/she still feels healthy. What is Staging? Cancer, including lymphoma is staged depending on how many body areas are involved. The more localized the cancer is, the lower the stage. The more areas are involved, the higher the stage. The stages of lymphoma are: Stage I: involvement of a single lymph nodeStage II: involvement of lymph nodes on only one side of the diaphragm (in either only the front half or only the back half of the body)Stage III: generalized involvement of peripheral lymph nodes, including both the cranial (above the waist) and caudal (below the waist) halves of the bodyStage IV: involvement of liver and/or spleenStage V: involvement of bone marrow, central nervous system or some other unusual location. The good news is that response to treatment in lymphoma is not affected by stage until the last stage is reached. Lymphoma staging also involves substaging, which includes determining if the patient is feeling healthy (substage A) or sick (substage B). Substage A carries a much better prognosis and response to treatment versus substage B. Obviously everyone wants to find their pet has potential for a long remission. This will mostly be determined by the what body part is involved, whether the patient feels sick or not, whether there are additional secondary problems (such as kidney failure as in renal lymphoma, or elevated blood calcium levels), and whether prior treatment might have made the tumor resistant to other treatments. What is Remission? Remission is the state where cancer is not detectable in the patient and the patient feels completely normal. (Note that this state is different from a cure, where the cancer is considered to be gone forever.) Prolonged remission is the goal of cancer therapy which, for most lymphoma cases, means chemotherapy. This may sound intimidating but chemotherapy for pets is not the same experience as it is for humans. For example, nausea and hair loss are generally uncommon for pets. Keep in mind that humans want a remission measured in decades if possible and most pets only need several years. This makes chemotherapy a different experience for pets. For any patient, there is an approximately 75% chanceof achieving remission no matter which protocol is used. Because lymphoma cells are quite sensitive to chemotherapy medications, there is an excellent chance of reducing the tumor to undetectable levels. How long a remission lasts depends on what protocol is used and a number of other factors. To learn more about where your pet fits into the statistics, please review the section on lymphoma in your pet's species. Numerous protocols are available and there is one to potentially fit every budget and every schedule. What is the Cure? Cure is the permanent removal of all traces of tumor such that no further treatment is needed. In effect, it is a permanent state of remission. While this is technically possible for your pet, it is more constructive and realistic to focus on increasing life quality. With lymphoma, remission is likely but cure is not. Treatment may be thought of as an exchange of only a short time with your pet for a substantially longer time with your pet. It is important to keep your goals in proper perspective through this treatment: In veterinary medicine, the goal for lymphoma is a long remission, not a cure.

Category: Lymphoma in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources The typical canine lymphoma patient is a middle-aged dog brought to the veterinarian because one or more lumps have been found. The veterinarian rapidly determines that these lumps are actually lymph nodes and that many (if not all) of the peripheral lymph nodes (those near the skin surface) are enlarged and firm. Usually the dog has not been showing any signs of illness; he simply has lumps. The next step is a blood panel and urinalysis to completely assess the patient's health, and one or more lymph nodes are aspirated or biopsied to confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma. So here we are. We know the average life expectancy for a patient with untreated lymphoma is about two months from the time of diagnosis. If this is your dog's situation, you probably need some time to absorb the cancer diagnosis. You have many general questions and you know that a decision regarding chemotherapy must be made. We will cover some commonly asked questions owners have at this point. How did my Dog get Lymphoma? Most of the time, we do not know how dogs or people get cancer. There are many types of cancer and many possible causes of all those cancers (chemicals in our environment, especially cigarette smoke, sun exposure, assorted viruses and infections). There are important genetic factors as well. Cancer starts with one or a small group of cells that have gone wrong. Such cells arise in our bodies all the time and we have an assortment of natural mechanisms to destroy these cells before they get out of hand. When these abnormal cells escape our natural mechanisms, cancer develops. It is important to realize that cancer is not contagious and that, as a pet owner, you should not feel that you somehow caused this or brought it on your pet. Many people feel a need to find blame and latch onto the idea that a household cleaner or pesticide was the cause. This is a natural part of grieving but it is important not to focus on cause unduly. Cause is not relevant to treatment; furthermore, there is no way to verify cause. At this time, there is no way to know what caused lymphoma development in a given patient. Genetically predisposed breeds include the Basset hound, boxer, Golden retriever, and St. Bernard.It is best to concentrate on treatment. Can my Dog be Cured? Theoretically, yes, but practically speaking, no. It is best to focus on a realistic outcome that is the longest possible survival with a good quality of life. Different treatment protocols are associated with different disease-free intervals, meaning that the length of time your dog feels normal will vary depending on the protocol you choose. The disease-free interval also depends on patient factors (type of lymphoma, concurrent disease, prior treatment etc.). Obviously, the goal is to have as long a disease-free interval as possible. Does my Pet Need Further Tests? Most likely the answer is yes because there is a great deal more to know before treatment options can be determined. We need to know about the state of the patient's general health and if there are any medications that should not be considered. We need to know what type of lymphocytes are involved. We need to know how far the cancer has spread. Basic blood work and a urinalysis will be needed to assess the patient's ability to take the medications needed. Obviously liver and kidney function will be relevant, but the blood calcium level is particularly worthy of scrutiny. Some types of lymphoma produce a hormone called PTH-rp (parathyroid hormone related protein) that is capable of creating dangerous elevations in the blood calcium level (seehypercalcemiafor more details.) A dog with an elevated blood calcium level tends to have a poorer prognosis. Approximately 15 percent of dogs with lymphoma (and 40 percent of dogs with T-cell lymphoma) have elevated blood calcium levels, so screening is important from the beginning. If a biopsy has not been performed, it may be a good idea to do one so as to get the maximum information about the tumor (whether it is slow or fast growing, what type of lymphocytes are involved, etc.) as this information can help predict the response to chemotherapy. Special staining of the sample, or even a test such as flow cytometry, is needed to distinguish the type of lymphocyte involved in the tumor. T-cell lymphoma, for example, is less responsive to medication than B-cell lymphoma. Luckily, B-cell lymphoma accounts for 75 percent of canine lymphoma. Other tests that may be recommended include a bone marrow aspirate , ultrasound of the abdomen, and/or a spleen or liver aspirate. These tests are needed to stage the disease, which basically means determining how widespread the cancer is in the body. Lymphoma is classified by stage: Stage I:only one lymph node involvedStage II: several lymph nodes in the same general area involvedStage III: all peripheral lymph nodes involvedStage IV: all peripheral lymph nodes plus the spleen, liver, and/or anterior mediastinum in the chest involvedStage V: bone marrow involvement, regardless of any other areas involved Staging has less impact on therapy choices than one might think but it is true that patients in Stage V, the most advanced stage, have a poorer prognosis than those in the other stages. How does Lymphoma Cause Death? Lymphoma is a rapidly growing malignancy that is able to arise and/or travel to anywhere where there is lymph tissue. Of course, there is lymph tissue in virtually every organ in the body. Eventually, the cancer will infiltrate an organ to such an extent that that organ fails (often this is the bone marrow or the liver). The patient loses appetite, vomits or gets diarrhea, weakens and dies. At some point the tumor becomes resistant to therapy and no further remissions can be obtained. My Dog does not Fit the Above Scenario at all. What are other Forms of Lymphoma? Lymphoma is classified by the anatomic area affected. By far, the most common form in dogs is the multicentric form, which accounts for 84 percent of canine lymphoma. In this form, as in the hypothetical case we opened with, all peripheral lymph nodes are large and firm. There are three other forms of lymphoma: Lymphoma can occur anywhere in the body where there is lymph tissue. At this time, we will concentrate on multicentric lymphoma. Eventually further information on these rarer forms will be added. Chemotherapy FAQ The word chemotherapy conjures images of people losing their hair and suffering chronic nausea. It is unfortunate that many pets do not receive chemotherapy based upon these unpleasant images that do not truly represent the current state of treatment response in pets. Chemotherapy simply means therapy using medication (as opposed to using surgery or radiation). Decades of research has gone into patient comfort, minimizing side effects and maximizing response so it is important to keep an open mind. The following are common questions pet owners commonly have regarding chemotherapy for their dog. The median survival time for most dogs on chemotherapy is approximately one year with 25 percent of dogs surviving two years. My dog is not acting sick in any way. Shouldn't I wait until she at least feels sick before beginning chemotherapy?This might seem like a reasonable approach at first glance but let us assure you that it is not. One of the most important factors in determining the quality of remission (i.e., how fast we get remission and how long it lasts) is whether or not the patient is feeling sick at the time chemotherapy is started. When lymphoma patients are staged (see above under "does my pet need further tests?"), stages are subcategorized asaorb, depending on whether or not the patient is feeling ill or not. For example, a multicentric lymphoma dog who feels well is in stage IIIa compared to one who is vomiting or not eating is in stage IIIb. You will have a much better chance for long-term quality survival if lymphoma is treated while the patient is ana. Are there other factors that might suggest a better or worse response to treatment?The goal is to achieve remission quickly and for the longest possible time. Factors that contribute to an individual dog's ability to do this include: Should we see an oncologist?Lymphoma is a condition that not all veterinarians are comfortable treating. Discuss with your veterinarian whether referral to a specialist would be best for you and your pet. Will chemotherapy make my dog sick?Probably not. Nausea or infection are possibilities, but most dogs do not experience any such complications or they are readily controlled with medications. While approximately 25% will experience some kind of side effect, only 7% of patients experience side effects serious enough to require hospitalization. Human chemotherapy is generally much more aggressive, largely because survival goals are much longer, and as a result there is a larger side effect situation. In pets, goals are different — a year of remission versus a decade of remission for people — and protocols are less aggressive. The bottom line is that most pets on chemotherapy do not have significant side effect issues but if they do occur, they are usually manageable. Will chemotherapy make my dog lose his hair or go bald?While whiskers are commonly lost, substantial hair loss is not experienced by most dogs or cats on chemotherapy. There are some notable exceptions in those breeds that have synchronous hair follicle activity. Most breeds have hairs in all different stages of the growth-shed cycle at the same time. A few breeds have all hairs in the same stage at the same time. The breeds, including some of their mixed breeds, that have a baldness issue include Old English Sheepdog, poodle, Lhasa Apso, and Shih Tzu. How will I know when we have achieved remission?A patient in remission is indistinguishable from a completely cancer-free patient. The lymph nodes will go down to normal size and if there were any signs of illness related to the cancer, these should resolve. The chance of achieving remission is pretty good with most protocols: 50-80% depending on the protocol selected. The real differences in protocols concern how long the remission is likely to last. Obviously there are patient factors in play that influence this; see above. How will I know when we have lost remission?The most obvious sign will be that the lymph node enlargement has returned. This means that the cancer is now resistant to the drugs being used and new drugs must be chosen. (Seeking a second remission after the first remission has been lost is called a rescue.) How long will my dog have quality life on chemotherapy?This depends on what protocol you choose, and there are many. There are also many factors that influence how an individual will do relative to the average response. Important parameters to note when reviewing a protocol are: Commonly employed protocols are CHOP, single agent doxorubicin, doxorubicin and prednisolone, Tanovea® and doxorubicin and prednisolone monotherapy.  See the links for more information on each drug and its associated side effects and issues. New protocols and new medications are constantly being developed and specialists have the most up to date information. What is CHOP Therapy?CHOP is an acronym forcyclophosphamide, doxorubicin HCI (hydroxydaunrubicin),vincristine(brand name Oncovin) andprednisolone/prednisone. The prednisolone/prednisone is typically given daily at home as a tablet while weekly injections/oral treatments are done in the hospital. There are several variations of this regimen but this multidrug format is probably the most common protocol employed regardless of the type of lymphoma. For B-cell lymphomas, 80-90 percent can be expected to achieve remission within the first month. The median survival time is 12 months with 25 percent of patients still alive at two years. Whether the protocol can be curtailed after a certain time or if it should be continued indefinitely is a subject of debate. For T-cell lymphoma, approximately 70 percent will achieve remission with a six to eight month median survival time. CHOP protocols involve drugs that have specific handling requirements and are generally performed with an oncology specialist. What is Tanovea®?Tanovea-CA1 is the brand name of a product called rabacfosadine. It is given as an IV infusion every 3 weeks for up to five treatments. It is one of the newest treatments in use for lymphoma. When it is combined with doxorubicin, 68% of dogs achieved remission with a median duration of 194 days while 16% achieved a partial remission. Tanovea-CA1 can be used alone but seems to work better with other medications. The main side effect of concern is pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring), which is fatal in 5% of patients. West Highland White terriers are predisposed to pulmonary fibrosis and many experts feel this drug should not be used in this breed and should be used with warnings and extra monitoring in any terrier. What if there are No Specialists or there are Financial Limitations?If there are no oncology specialists in your area, it may be possible for your regular veterinarian to consult with a specialist to put together an appropriate protocol. There are also services where your veterinarian can not only consult with an oncologist but can also obtain needed medications. If a low income solution is needed, it may be worth considering prednisolone/prednisone monotherapy, which  is a fancy term for givingprednisolone/prednisonealone with no other chemotherapy agents. As chemotherapy goes, prednisolone/prednisone is quite benign and many, if not most, dogs have been on it one time or another for itchy skin. prednisolone/prednisone kills lymphocytes including malignant ones. As with other protocols, remission is frequently obtained within the first month but the remission is likely to be short (one to two months) unless other medications are added in. Furthermore, the use of prednisolone/prednisone makes the tumor resistant to other agents of chemotherapy so that it will be especially difficult to get a second remission after the first remission is lost. The bottom line is that a remission will likely be possible at a low cost without seeing a specialist, but it will likely be a short one. This option is for patients for whom the other protocols are unavailable. It should also be mentioned that funded research studies are periodically available. These are clinical trials examining an experimental protocol without cost to the pet owner after it has been determined that a patient is a candidate. See whatclinical trialsare available.

Category: Lymphoma in the Skin of Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (also known as cutaneous T cell lymphoma and cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma) Lymphoma can arise in any organ that contains lymph tissue (which turns out to be just about anywhere in the body). While lymphoma generally occurs in lymph nodes and organs with substantial lymphatic system presence, occasionally, lymphoma arises in the skin. Skin forms of lymphoma are often itchy and rashy and thus are readily mistaken for allergic dermatitis. Further compounding the difficulty in making the correct diagnosis is the fact that superficial skin infections are common not only in allergy situations but in many skin diseases, including skin lymphoma, so partial responses to antibiotics may be misleading. Lymphoma in the skin would be a rare cause of dermatitis, but there comes a point where a biopsy is needed to explain a poor response to the usual therapies. A biopsy is needed to capture the diagnosis of lymphoma. Three Types There are three types: mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, and pagetoid reticulosis. Mycosis Fungoides The name "mycosis fungoides" suggests a benign fungal infection, but nothing could be farther from the truth. Mycosis fungoides is a very malignant form of skin lymphoma; it is named for fungus because the tumors are said to resemble mushrooms. An oral form also exists where the gums become inflamed and ulcerated. This could also be mistaken for any number of oral diseases, and again, a biopsy is needed to find the truth. As mentioned, it can look like a skin infection with nodules and frequently goes unrecognized until it fails to respond to the usual skin-oriented antibiotics and is biopsied. Sézary Syndrome (A Rare Complication) Mycosis fungoides can progress to what is called Sézary syndrome. Here, skin cancer advances into the bloodstream to create leukemia. The cancer cells in the blood are not like other leukemia cells and are called Sézary cells. This complication almost never happens in dogs but happens in approximately 5 percent of humans with mycosis fungoides, so the term may come up if you do any internet research. Pagetoid Reticulosis The only difference between pagetoid reticulosis and mycosis fungoides is seen on biopsy. Pagetoid reticulosis is a more superficial form of skin lymphoma that does not penetrate to deeper skin structures. It can be localized to one area of the skin or to larger areas of the skin. Prognosis Most pets succumb to euthanasia when there are too many ulcerated growths, too much intractable itching, or the infections cannot be controlled. Variable survival times have been reported in different studies, but the prognosis is generally regarded as poor, while a good goal is six months for dogs and perhaps 10 months for cats. (This contrasts with the human form of the disease, which is much more readily controlled with chemotherapy.)  For many patients, the goal of chemotherapy is not to achieve a longer survival but to improve life quality during a relatively short survival. Most studies report median survival times of 6-7 months. Treatments Since most tumors arise in groups or involve large areas, surgery or radiotherapy will not be effective. Chemotherapy will be needed to reach all the tumors. This might be provided by a single medication likelomustinebut could just as likely include a multi-drug combination protocol involving such medications asL-asparaginase,prednisolone,cyclophosphamide,vincristine,and/ordoxorubicin. Aside from chemotherapy regimens, a few less conventional methods have emerged. Retinoids Skin lymphoma cells appear to have receptors for synthetic vitamin A derivatives. Median survival times have been increased with retinoids. This all sounds good, but the type of retinoids used to treat such skin diseases also cause human birth defects, and because of this, their access is highly regulated, and they are very difficult to obtain in the U.S. Safflower Oil The Hollywood brand of safflower oil (apparently, the Hain brand does not work) was given to six out of eight dogs who had lost remission from conventional treatment and were able to achieve remission with no other therapy. It should be noted that this was a very small study (only eight dogs), and GI upset can result from the twice-weekly oil doses needed for this therapy. Rabacfosadine This is a new medication recently approved for lymphoma treatment in dogs. When combined withprednisolone, 45 percent of dogs with this condition achieved at least partial remission.

Category: Lymphoma Treatment Includes Nutritional Therapy for Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources After a diagnosis of cancer has been confirmed, many pet owners seek nutritional advice in an effort to address the disease from another angle. The fact is that no supplement or dietary approach is going to kill tumor cells directly; there is no secret super nutrient with cancer-killing properties. Instead, the goals of nutrition for the cancer patient focus on preserving body condition:  maintaining a good appetite, maintaining a healthy body weight and maintaining muscle mass. Beyond this, people wonder if there is a nutritional strategy that might put a tumor at a disadvantage: Not a cancer-killing super-nutrient per se but more of a general program that might create an edge over a regular commercial pet food. Several theories have emerged on how this might be done but, unfortunately, a lot of scientific evidence has not followed. Here are commonly employed strategies: Let's look at these more closely. Low Carb Diet Cancers tend to use anaerobic metabolism, in part because they do not have normal structure or blood vessel support, and inadequate blood to a tissue means inadequate oxygen, and inadequate oxygen means anaerobic metabolism. Anaerobic metabolism burns carbohydrates rather than fats. There are actually more complex reasons for tumors to go anaerobic beyond not having a proper blood supply but the fact is that tumors tend to want to burn carbohydrates while healthy tissues want to burn fats. The theory of the low-carb diet is that fewer carbohydrates coming in means less food for the tumor. This theory is of some controversy but if you wish to feed such a diet, it is important to seek a food with less than 20 percent carbohydrates. Be aware that grain-free diets are usually not low in carbohydrates. Grain-free diets cater to the idea that some animals are not tolerant of grain proteins so these foods employ potatoes, yams or similar vegetables as carbohydrate sources. Recently grain-free diets have been implicated inheart diseaseso it is best not to feed them unless there is a reason to do so, such asfood allergy. Raw Foods Raw foods have some advantages over cooked foods. They are frequently more palatable than cooked foods. Because they are uncooked, their proteins are unaltered by the cooking process and may be less allergenic. There is some argument that raw foods are more digestible than cooked foods because they more closely match the diet that an animal evolved to digest. On the flip side of this is bacterial contamination, a very real concern and a special risk for a cancer patient whose immune system is probably altered. There have been numerous studies showing pathogenic bacteria in raw foods (both home prepared and commercially obtained). The last thing a cancer patient needs is a bacterial intestinal infection, so most experts recommend against raw foods especially for patients who have cancer. Home Cooking Home cooking can provide a highly palatable food for a patient with a sensitive appetite. The problem is that there is an abundance of recipes that turn out to be nutritionally incomplete when compared to the National Research Council (NRC) minimum requirements. Obviously, the cancer patient needs at least the same nutrition as a healthy patient. Pet nutrition, especially when disease is involved, is not a do-it-yourself project where one assembles ingredients that seem whole and healthy and attempts to complete the diet with a multivitamin. If you are going to cook food for a pet, it is vital to have professional guidance beyond a web site that looks knowledgeable or a book that seems scholarly. A professional nutritionist should be consulted and this means a veterinarian who is a diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Nutrition. Some helpful resources include ACVN.org and BalanceIt.com It is not clear if anything more can be achieved with a home cooked diet as opposed to a commercially prepared one but many people feel more comfortable making foods free of artificial preservatives or flavor enhancers. The main goal is to provide a palatable but still nutritionally complete food for the patient. Omega 3 Fatty Acids What is a fatty acid? Biochemically, a fatty acid is what we colloquially call plain old fat.  A fatty acid consists of a long carbon chain  (say 20 or so carbons in length) with a biochemical acid group at one end. But there are different kinds of fat. Some fats are stored and burned as fuels and some fats form the structure of our cell membranes. It is these fatty acids that are recruited in the inflammatory cascade to be converted into prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. Omega 3 fatty acids are similarly recruited but do not convert to inflammatory mediators. Examples of omega three fatty acids, also called n-3 fatty acids, include alpha linolenic acid (ALA); Eicosopentanoic acid (EPA); and docosahexanoic acid (DHA). Saturated Vs. Unsaturated There is more evidence for omega 3 fatty acid having anti-cancer properties at high doses. The best source of DHA and EPA is cold water fish oils. Flax seed oil is a good source of ALA and is preferred by many people who want the benefits of an omega 3 fatty acid without the fishy taste. ALA, unfortunately, is not a very useful omega 3 fatty acids for dogs and cats so DHA and EPA are needed. Luckily, most pets like the fishy smell and taste. Examples of omega three fatty acids (also called n-3 fatty acids): Alpha linolenic acid, Eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexanoic acid. An excellent source is cold water fish oils. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to inhibit the growth and spread of cancer, plus they have anti-inflammatory properties. In the study that launched Hill's  n/d, a food for cancer patients, 32 dogs with lymphoma were divided randomly into two groups: one that received a diet heavy in menhaden fish oil and one that received a diet heavy in soy bean oil. Both groups also received chemotherapy withdoxorubicin. The dogs that received this omega 3 fatty acid diet went into remission sooner and stayed in remission longer than dogs that received the soy bean oil diet. Both the low carb and omega three fatty acid therapies are incorporated into some therapeutic diets available only at your clinic, which are canned food and for dogs only. Should my Dog Use this Diet? The Hill's n/d may be of tremendous benefit to a dog with lymphoma but there are a few caveats: Hollywood Brand Safflower Oil and Mycosis Fungoides There is a particularly difficult form of T-cell lymphoma called Mycosis fungoides. This type of lymphoma is limited to the skin and, like most T-cell forms of lymphoma, it is resistant to the usual lymphoma treatments. It seems there is some basis for using one of the omega 6 fatty acids: linoleum acid. There are two major brands of safflower oil on the market: Hain and Hollywood. Apparently Hollywood is the brand with the most linoleic acid and is the brand of choice in this somewhat controversial treatment. In one study using eight dogs with Mycosis fungoides (the skin T-cell form of lymphoma), six dogs achieved remission with no other therapy. Minimal adverse effects come with the use of this oil (if too much oil is used there is a possibility of pancreatitis but, in general, obesity from the fat is the only problem). Safflower oil is inexpensive and readily available.

Category: Mammary Tumors in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We have all heard of breast cancer in women. With approximately one woman in eight or nine falling victim to this form of cancer, there are awareness campaigns from numerous health care agencies and research continues. What many pet owners do not know is that the incidence of mammary tumor development in dogs is even higher than it is for humans: one unspayed dog in four is affected. This is a huge incidence, yet awareness among owners of female dogs is lacking. Protection from Spaying A female puppy spayed before her first heat cycle can expect never to develop a mammary tumor of any kind. The incidence of tumor development in this group is nearly zero. If she is allowed to experience one heat cycle before spaying, the incidence rises to 7 percent (still quite low). If she is allowed to experience more than one heat cycle, the risk increases to one in four. Tumor Detection If your dog is unspayed, was known to have had puppies, or was spayed in adulthood, she fits into the high-risk group for mammary cancer development. It is important to be somewhat familiar with the normal mammary anatomy of the female dog. There are five sets of mammary glands, as shown, though the average female dog has only nine. (It is not unusual for asymmetry of mammary glands to be found.) The normal glands should be soft and pliant, especially towards the rear legs. There should be no firm lumps. If a lump is detected, see your veterinarian at once regarding possible removal. Most tumors occur in the glands nearest the rear legs. Mammary tumors are most commonly diagnosed in dogs ages nine to 11 years. You should begin conscientiously checking your female dog for growth starting at age six years. This includes both unspayed female dogs and female dogs spayed as adults. Preparing for Surgery: Radiography Staging the tumor before planning removal is ideal, and this means checking to see if it has spread to the lungs. If the tumor has already spread, removing the original (primary) tumor in the mammary gland is likely not going to be helpful unless the tumor is eroded or open and needs removal for quality of life reasons. Further, cancer in the chest is an important surgical risk factor, and it should be ruled out before surgery. If there is cancer in the chest, therapy must be directed toward the whole dog rather than toward the localized tumor. To see the most detail in the lungs, most oncologists recommend three views of the chest (profile with left side down, profile with right side down, and either top to bottom or bottom to top). These views allow maximum inflation of all parts of the lung so that even small tumors can be seen. After surgery for a malignant mammary tumor, similar radiographs are periodically recommended to screen for evidence of tumor spread in case some cells had managed to escape surgical removal. In general, if no spread has been detected after two years, the tumor can be considered permanently cured. Preparing for Surgery: Tissue Evaluation There are many factors to consider when planning to remove a mammary tumor. For example, not all tumors in the mammary area are mammary tumors. Some are mast cell tumors or other types of skin tumors. Furthermore, approximately 50 percent of mammary tumors are benign in dogs, and removal may not need to be aggressive in this situation. It would be nice to know, going into surgery, what the tumor type is and whether or not it is malignant. To accomplish this, tissue must be evaluated. An aspiration of cells will yield enough information to determine if the tumor is mammary and may indicate if it is benign or malignant. Unfortunately, there is frequently some ambiguity in the latter part of this evaluation, making the evaluation of malignancy challenging. An actual biopsy sample is more accurate. Frequently, the surgeon will opt to attempt an excisional biopsy first. This not only accurately identifies the tumor but potentially completely removes it, allowing for a cure in one surgical procedure and sparing the expense of potentially less accurate pre-surgical tissue. Obviously, it is not always possible to remove the entire tumor on the first surgery in this way, but often, it is. Hormone Receptors Approximately 50 percent of malignant mammary tumors in dogs have receptors for either estrogen or progesterone. These female hormones promote the growth of these tumors. Benign tumors also have female hormone receptors and can be stimulated by the hormonal cycling of the female dog. This means that spaying is important even if a tumor has already developed; in one study, female dogs spayed at the time of their tumor removal (or in the two years prior to the tumor removal) lived 45 percent longer than those who remained unspayed. Types of Tumors The following are common classes of mammary tumors that might be found on a biopsy. Fibroadenoma A benign glandular tumor for which no treatment is necessary. Mixed Mammary Tumor What is mixed is the type of cell that makes up the tumor. (Mixed does not refer to a mix of benign and malignant cells.) The mixed tumor can be either benign or malignant, and the biopsy will indicate this, though by far, most mixed tumors are benign. Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinomas can be tubular or papillary, depending on the gland cells from which the tumor arises. Adenocarcinomas behave malignantly, but how aggressively malignant they are depends not on whether they are tubular or papillary but on other cellular characteristics described by the pathologist (such as how quickly the cells appear to be dividing and how closely they resemble normal gland cells). After reading the description, the oncologist will be able to determine how aggressively to combat the tumor. Inflammatory Carcinoma The inflammatory carcinoma is a highly malignant tumor that generates tremendous inflammation locally with ulceration, pus, and discomfort. This type of tumor tends to spread early in its course and is virtually impossible to treat. Because many less malignant and more common mammary tumors also become ulcerated, this particularly malignant tumor may not be diagnosed before surgery and frequently is unable to heal from the very surgery needed to identify it. Fortunately, this especially tragic tumor type accounts for less than 5% of mammary tumors. In general, approximately 50% of malignant mammary tumors will have already spread by the time of surgery. This means that the other 50% are locally confined, and surgery is curative. What Else Determines Prognosis? The type of tumor is obviously important in determining the prognosis; further, spaying at the time of tumor removal or before is also an important factor in determining prognosis. Other factors include: The biopsy sample will not only identify the tumor type but will also indicate whether or not the tumor was completely removed (so-called clean or dirty margins). If the tumor was not completely removed, you may wish to consider a second surgery to remove more tissue. Further Therapy? Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and anti-estrogen therapy have been used for incompletely removed tumors. Sometimes it is most appropriate to monitor for recurrence with periodic chest radiographs. Specialized care is often required for cancer patients. Not all veterinarians are comfortable performing oncology.

Category: Osteosarcoma in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  What is Osteosarcoma? Osteosarcoma is by far the most common bone tumor of dogs, usually striking the leg bones of larger breeds. Osteosarcoma usually occurs in middle aged or elderly dogs but can occur in a dog of any age; larger breeds tend to develop tumors at younger ages. How do we Know my Dog Really has an Osteosarcoma? Radiographs (x-rays)The lytic lesion looks like an area of bone has been eaten away. One of the first steps in evaluating a persistent lameness is radiography (x-rays). Bone tumors are tender so it is usually clear what part of the limb should be radiographed. The osteosarcoma creates some characteristic findings. Radiography is almost completely diagnostic in most cases, but there are a few other far less common conditions that can mimic the appearance of a bone tumor, so a confirming test is going to be needed if one is to be complete. If a basic blood panel and urinalysis haven't been done, this would also be a good time to do so as basic information about liver and kidney function will be needed for treatment regardless of whether this turns out to be a bone tumor or not; plus, a tissue sample from the bone is needed for confirmation (see later). Tissue Sampling: Biopsy and Needle AspirateRadiographs are close to being confirmatory but still they are not definitive. Since life and death decisions are going to be made, it is best to obtain a tissue sample for confirmation. This can be done by either biopsy or by needle aspirate. BiopsyA small piece of bone can be harvested surgically. The bone is preserved, sectioned, and examined under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. There are several problems associated with this diagnostic.  Sometimes a bone tumor is surrounded by an area of bone inflammation and it may be difficult to get a representative sample. The tiny hole that results when a core of bone is removed can create a weak spot and the bone can actually break. Even if the procedure goes well, often there is increased pain and lameness for the patient afterwards. With so many potential problems, most specialists have switched to needle aspirate for diagnosis. Needle AspirateWith needle aspirate, a large bore needle is inserted into the area of the tumor and cells are withdrawn for analysis. A full core of bone is not removed, just a sampling of cells. This is usually sufficient to confirm osteosarcoma. If there is ambiguity, certain stains can often settle any questions the pathologist may have. With a Diagnosis Confirmed, Staging is the next Consideration Osteosarcoma is an aggressive tumor and it can be assumed to have spread by the time it is first diagnosed; there is no possibility of preventing spread. That said, how well treatments can be expected to work depend on whether or not the tumor spread has progressed so as to be visible. Because osteosarcoma spreads to the lungs as one of its first stops, chest radiographs are important in checking for visible tumor spread. If there is already visible tumor spread at diagnosis, this changes what treatments are recommended. Some specialists recommend nuclear imaging of the skeleton to identify any spread to other bones, which might also alter recommendations; however, this form of imaging is not readily available. What if it isn’t Really an Osteosarcoma? The location and radiographic appearance of the osteosarcoma in the limb are quite classic but there are a few outside possibilities that should at least be mentioned. Only a few other possible conditions cause similar lesions in bone: the chondrosarcoma, the squamous cell carcinoma, the synovial cell sarcoma, or fungal bone infection. ChondrosarcomaChondrosarcoma is a cartilage tumor, possibly not as malignant as the osteosarcoma. The chondrosarcoma generally occurs on flat bones such as ribs or skull bones and is not usually found in the limbs. Still, should a chondrosarcoma occur in the limb, treatment recommendations still include amputation of the affected bone and many of the same treatments as for osteosarcoma. Squamous Cell CarcinomaThesquamous cell carcinomais a tumor of the external coating of the bone, called the periosteum. This is a destructive tumor locally but it tends to spread relatively slowly. Again, a bone suspected of malignant tumor should be amputated, and the tissue then analyzed and then treatment adjustments should be made thereafter. The squamous cell carcinoma tends not to arise in the same bone areas as the osteosarcoma; it tends to arise in the jaw bones or in the toe bones. Synovial Cell SarcomaThis is a tumor of the joint capsule lining. Its hallmark is that it affects both bones of the joint. The osteosarcoma, no matter how large or destructive it becomes, will never cross over to an adjacent bone. Prognosis is much better with amputation with synovial cell sarcoma. Fungal Bone InfectionCoccidiodes immitisis a fungus native to the lower Sonoran life zone of the southwestern United States. It is the infectious agent of the disease called San Joaquin Valley Fever or justValley Fever. (More scientifically, the condition is called coccidioidomycosis.)  In most cases, infection is limited to a few calcified lymph nodes in the chest and possibly lung disease. In some rare cases, though, the fungus disseminated through the body and can cause a very proliferative bone infection. The bone infection of coccidiodomycosis grows rapidly and lacks the lytic lesions that are typical of the osteosarcoma. Other fungi, such as Histoplasma capsulatum, also have potential for bone involvement. Pursuit of this possibility makes sense if you live in an area where these fungi are a concern. Disseminated fungal disease is serious and even though this diagnosis is not cancerous, amputating the limb is most likely going to be necessary. Treatment of osteosarcoma involves two aspects:treating the pain and fighting the cancer’s spread. How do we Treat the Pain? Keep in mind that dogs are usually euthanized because of the pain in the affected bone. Treating the pain successfully will allow a dog to live comfortably and extend life expectancy by virtue of extending comfort. There are two ways to address the pain: amputatating the limb and palliative radiotherapy (usually combined with periodic bisphosphonate infusion treatments). For most patients, there is one tumor on a leg and no visible tumor spread in the lungs. These are the patients with the best potential results and they are good candidates for amputation. Patients with a lot of arthritis in the other legs or with tumor spread evident in the chest already are probably not candidates for amputation and it may be more appropriate to keep the leg and simply relieve the pain with radiotherapy. Amputating the LimbSince the tumor in the limb is the source of pain, it makes sense that amputating the limb would resolve the pain. In fact, this is true. Removing the affected limb resolves the pain in 100 percent of cases. Unfortunately, many people are reluctant to have this procedure performed because of misconceptions. Read a letterabout amputation from a veterinarian who sees too many owners who reject the option of amputation out of hand. His letter includes videos of two happy dogs without limbs. Limb-sparing Surgery (removing the tumor but not the leg)Limb-sparing techniques developed for humans have been adapted for dogs. To spare the limb and thus avoid amputation, the tumorous bone is removed and either replaced by a bone graft from a bone bank or the remaining bone can be re-grown via a new technique called bone transport osteogenesis. The joint nearest the tumor is fused (i.e., fixed in one position and cannot be flexed or extended.) While amputation can be viewed as a pain management strategy, limb-sparing is only performed in conjunction with chemotherapy. It is important to keep in mind that grafting of a new bone structure requires healing time and that a great deal of post-operative confinement time is needed (in a patient whose life expectancy is going to be measured in months). For the right patient, limb-sparing can be the best choice but be sure to understand all the details of post-operative care from the specialist. Palliative Radiotherapy for Pain ControlSometimes amputation is simply not the right choice and happily there is an effective alternative treatment. Radiation can be applied to the tumor in two, three or four doses, depending on the protocol. Improved limb function is usually evident within the first 3 weeks and typically lasts 2 to 4 months. When pain returns, radiation can be given again for further pain relief if deemed appropriate based on the stage of the cancer at that time. There are a couple of caveats: Current standard treatment involves pairing palliative radiation with monthly infusions of medications called bisphosphonates. BisphosphonatesThis class of drug has become the standard of care in humans with bone tumors and have been found helpful in managing osteosarcoma pain in dogs as well. Bisphosphonates act by inhibiting bone destruction, which in turn helps control the pain and bone damage caused by the bone tumor. The most common bisphosphonate in use for dogs has been pamidronate, though a new drug zoledronate is taking its place gradually. Treatment is given as an IV drip over two hours in the hospital every 3 to 4 weeks. In humans, an assortment of potential side effects have emerged (fever, muscle pain, nausea all lasting 1 to 2 days in up to 25 percent of patients, renal disease in certain situations, low blood calcium levels, jaw bone cell death); these issues so far have not panned out as problems for dogs and cats. Bisphosphonates are important in managing bone tumor pain in patients that have no undergone amputation. Analgesic DrugsAt this time there are numerous analgesic medications available for dogs with this tumor. No single medication, however, is a match for the pain involved in what amounts to a slowly exploding bone. A combination of medications is needed to be reasonably palliative and should be considered only as a last resort if amputation or radiation therapy will not be pursued. There are several types of drugs that can be combined. These different drugs are often given together to create analgesia to the osteosarcoma patient when amputation and radiotherapy are not going to happen. It is important to realize that there is a limit to how much pain relief can be achieved against a bone tumor with only pills. It will not be long before the pain of this tumor, as evidenced by not using the leg, tenderness to the touch, etc., overpowers the effect of oral medications. How do we Treat the Cancer? Osteosarcoma is unfortunately a fast-spreading tumor. By the time the tumor is found, it is considered to have already spread. Osteosarcoma spreads to the lung in a malignant process called metastasis. Prognosis is substantially worse if the tumor spread is visible on chest radiographs, so if you are contemplating chemotherapy, chest radiographs should be taken. Cisplatin(given by IV every 3 to 4 weeks for 3 treatments) Carboplatin(given by IV every 3 to 4 weeks for 4 treatments) Doxorubicin(given IV every 2 weeks for 5 treatments) Doxorubicin and Cisplatin in Combination(both given IV together every 3 weeks for four treatments) What is Median Survival Time? There are a number of ways to statistically evaluate the central tendency of a group. The median is the value at which 50% of the group falls above and 50% of the group falls below. This is a little different from the average of the group, though more people are familiar with this term. When evaluating median survival times, you are looking at a 50% chance of surviving longer than the median and a 50% chance of surviving less than the median. What Does Chemotherapy Put my Dog Through? Most people have an image of the chemotherapy patient either through experience or the media and this image typically includes lots of weakness, nausea, and hair loss. In fact, the animal experience in chemotherapy is not nearly as dramatic. After the pet has a treatment, expect 1 to 2 days of lethargy and nausea. This is often substantially helped with medications like Zofran, a strong anti-nausea drug commonly used in chemotherapy patients. These side effects are worse if a combination of drugs is used but the pet is typically back to normal by the third day after treatment. Effectively, you are trading 8 days of sickness for 6 to 12 months of quality life. Hair loss is not usually a feature of animal chemotherapy. In dogs, hair loss may occur in breeds that have continuously growing coats, such as poodles, Scottish terriers, and Westies. Axial Osteosarcoma While osteosarcoma of the limbs is the classical form of this disease, osteosarcoma can develop anywhere there is bone. "Axial" osteosarcoma is the term for osteosarcoma originating in bones other than limb bones, with the most common affected bones being the jaws (both lower and upper). Victims of the axial form of osteosarcoma tend to be smaller, middle-aged, and females outnumber males two to one. In the axial skeleton the tumor does not grow rapidly as do the appendicular tumors, thus leading to a more insidious course of disease. The tumor may be there for as long as two years before it is formally diagnosed. An exception is osteosarcoma of the rib, which tends to be more aggressive than other axial osteosarcomas. Treatment for axial osteosarcoma is similar to that for the appendicular form: surgery followed by chemotherapy. There is one exception, that being osteosarcoma of the lower jaw. Because of the slower growth of the axial tumor and the ability to remove part or all of the jaw bone with little loss of function or cosmetic disfigurement, it has been reported that 71% of cases survived one year or longer with no chemotherapy at all.

Category: Pituitary Macroadenoma in Cushing's Syndrome
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources As you probably know at this stage, most Cushing's disease is caused by a pituitary tumor that is over-secreting its hormonal messages to the adrenal glands and causing all the excess stimulation that leads to all the symptoms of Cushing's disease. Most pituitary tumors responsible for Cushing’s disease are so small that their size is insignificant and we can concentrate on their hormone-producing issues only. In other words, it doesn't matter that the pituitary gland (and its tumor) is located at the base of the brain deep inside the skull as long as the tumor is very small; we can just worry about the hormones it produces and never mind its location. Approximately 10-20% of dogs with pituitary dependent Cushing’s disease have a tumor that actually is large enough to take up a meaningful amount of space, unfortunately. These tumors are called "macrotumors" and since there is not much extra space within the skull for extra structures, a macrotumor can compress normal brain tissue and lead to neurologic disease. Further, a pituitary tumor may not be macro at the time Cushing's disease is first diagnosed but may grow to become macro over the years to come. It is thus a good idea to become familiar with signs to watch for and even better to have periodic brain imaging to check the tumor's changing size. How Big is too Big? Ten millimeters (about half of an inch) is the size a pituitary tumor must reach to be categorized as a macrotumor in a human being. Dogs obviously have more variance in the size and shape of their skulls than do people thus it may be inaccurate to use the human definition for dogs but, so far, the veterinary profession has adopted the human description. It appears that up to 50% of dogs with pituitary tumors of this size do not have concurrent neurologic disease. We do not have information regarding how many of these asymptomatic dogs will go on to develop neurologic disease nor do we have rules for smaller dogs with smaller brains. Still, when a dog has a pituitary tumor of 10 mm in diameter and neurologic signs, the tumor should be considered the cause of the signs. In fact, the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine is using 8 mm as their cut-off size for recommending treatment. Is this Cancer? Not in the way most people think of cancer. Pituitary macrotumors are almost always benign in that they do not spread in any way. They can, however, produce harm simply because of their size and location. When Would an Owner Suspect a Pituitary Macrotumor? When a pituitary mass begins to expand, the owner is likely to notice subtle changes in behavior though nothing may be obvious even with a formal physical examination. The dog may seem just off, listless or may develop a poor appetite. Occasionally signs are more blatantly abnormal (walking in circles or seizures) but the subtle start is more common. It should be noted in particular that it is extremely abnormal for a dog with Cushing's disease not to have a good appetite even while on therapy. If a dog with Cushing's disease develops a poor appetite, they should be seen by the veterinarian promptly. Most dogs diagnosed with pituitary macroadenomas have been diagnosed with Cushing’s disease at least 6 months prior and are probably well controlled on medication, so this condition tends to appear out of the blue in an otherwise normal dog. In this situation, a macrotumor must be considered, especially if fresh blood testing does not reveal any new diseases. Of course, blatant neurologic signs in a dog with Cushing’s disease would definitely be suspicious for a pituitary macrotumor as well. Brachycephalic breeds (boxers, pugs etc.) tend to have the biggest pituitary tumors. How is Diagnosis Confirmed? Imaging of the brain is required to confirm a pituitary macrotumor and this means either CT (CAT scan) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). These procedures are expensive; for example, in Los Angeles brain imaging can easily cost a couple of thousand dollars. Special facilities are needed for the equipment involved, and referral to a specialty hospital is usually required. MRI is felt to be superior for imaging the pituitary gland and is the preferred imaging method for this situation; however, CT is more readily available. Both these imaging procedures are performed under general anesthesia and involve some risks. The equipment used is large and the patient must spend a good eight to 10 minutes without monitoring inside the equipment. Since MRI uses powerful magnets, normal anesthetic machines cannot be used (because they are metal) and injectable anesthetics are often needed. Injectable anesthesia is not as easily controlled as inhalation. At this time there is no blood test that can distinguish a macrotumor from a microtumor, but some promising tests are currently under investigation. How is a Pituitary Macrotumor Treated? While surgical removal of pituitary tumors is feasible in humans, the pituitary area is not nearly as accessible surgically in dogs. This means that radiation therapy is the only effective treatment available for pituitary macro tumors. Radiation therapy is performed usually two to three times weekly for four to six weeks and is an expensive undertaking of several thousand dollars. Of dogs that receive radiation therapy, 70 percent will have good improvement as a result with half of them having rapid improvement and the other half improving in the month or two following the course of therapy. Radiation therapy is not without complication. Common problems associated with this treatment include loss of pigment in the skin and hair in the area irradiated, hearing loss, and sometimes problems with tear production in the eyes. Many dogs experience a resolution of their Cushing’s disease if the pituitary tumor responds well, but one should plan to have to continue treatment for Cushing’s disease despite radiation as at least 50 percent still require treatment for their Cushing's disease. Very large tumors (greater than 25 mm in diameter) tend to be too big to respond. For this reason, early detection of the tumor is best and allows for more successful radiation therapy. Is Radiation Therapy Likely to be Curative? Unfortunately, no. The pituitary tumor is likely to recur in time (ranges are reported at 2.5 to 26 months for recurrence). Keep in mind that these patients are geriatric and might not live long enough to see their tumor recur. For more details, see the results of the Theon/Feldman study below. Should all Dogs with Pituitary Cushing’s Disease be Imaged to Potentially Catch the Tumor Early? This is a difficult question to answer; there are arguments either way. Imaging is not without risk since it involves general anesthesia and Cushing's disease patients are generally elderly. Further, imaging is expensive and there is only a 10 to 20 percent chance of finding a tumor big enough to warrant therapy. By the time it has been determined that a dog has Cushing's disease, many owners are tired of the seemingly endless progression of testing and associated expense. On the other hand, imaging early will identify dogs at risk for the development of a macrotumor. For example, a dog with a small tumor (less than 4 mm in diameter) at the time of Cushing's diagnosis is unlikely to live long enough for that tumor to quadruple in size to a tumor large enough to warrant attention. A dog with a larger tumor (say, 7 mm in diameter) could easily have a tumor of significant size in a year or two and such a patient should be re-imaged in 12 to 16 months to re-evaluate the tumor size. A tumor 10 mm in diameter at the time of the diagnosis of Cushing's disease is probably large enough to warrant radiotherapy right off the bat even if no signs are yet seen. If this last patient is not imaged at the beginning, it is likely that the tumor will not be treatable when it is big enough to create more obvious symptoms. A dog with an initial tumor size greater than 10 mm in diameter has a 66 percent chance of developing clinical signs directly attributable to the macro tumor. At this time, universities recommend brain imaging on all dogswith pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease if possible.UC Davis recommends that any tumor 8 mm in diameter or larger be irradiatedand that smaller masses be re-imaged in 12 to 14 months. Results of the Theon/Feldman Study (Theon, A.P. and Feldman E.C. Megavoltage irradiation of pituitary macrotumors in dogs with neurologic signs. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol 213, No 2, July 15, 1998.) Overall survival was increased in macrotumor patients with radiotherapy. The average survival time was approximately five months from the time neurologic problems had started (patients without neurologic problems were not included in this study). Out of 24 dogs in the study, seven survived longer than one year from the time of tumor diagnosis. If neurologic problems were categorized as severe (i.e. there was a compromised ability to walk), survival time wasnotimproved by radiotherapy. Milder neurologic deficits were associated with longer survival. In this study, both dogs with ACTH-secreting tumors (the kind that cause Cushing’s disease) and pituitary tumors that were hormonally inactive (the kind that do not cause Cushing’s disease) were studied. The dogs with ACTH-secreting tumors had better responses to radiotherapy than those with inactive tumors; however, in these patients, radiotherapy yielded a better chance of resolving neurologic problems than it did in resolving the symptoms of Cushing's disease.

Category: Prostate Cancer in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In male dogs, the prostate is a gland that produces nutrients to help sperm survive once inside the female’s reproductive tract. The prostate gland surrounds the opening of his urinary bladder, which collects urine, as well as the urethra, a tube-like structure that sends urine from the bladder to outside the body. Cancer Types Within the prostate gland, cancer is rare, occurring in only about 0.3-0.6% of dogs.  Cancer can originate in the prostate gland itself, which is called primary prostate cancer, or from another organ that spread, or metastasized, to the prostate. Most primary prostate cancers are aggressive and highly metastatic cancers. This means that they damage the tissues and grow and spread quite quickly. Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most common type of primary cancer in the canine prostate. Benign, or noncancerous tumors (e.g. leiomyoma), can occur in the prostate, but these are rare. Cancers that have spread from elsewhere in the body are also uncommon but can include lymphoma, which is associated with the immune system, and transitional cell carcinoma, a common cancer found in and around the bladder. Causes of Prostate Cancer Researchers have not been able to discover the cause of prostate cancer. Some research studies have suggested that neutered dogs are more likely to develop prostate cancer than un-neutered (i.e. intact) dogs. This finding does not necessarily mean that neutering causes the cancer. Neutered dogs tend to have a longer lifespan and receive better veterinary care, so it’s possible that intact dogs could develop prostate cancer equally under different conditions. Of course, plenty of intact male dogs are well-cared for and life long and happy lives, so many more research studies are needed to prove this theory one way or the other. What is important about this information is that both neutered and un-neutered dogs can get prostate cancer. Symptoms Symptoms may include urinating only small amounts at a time; urinating more often than usual; and/or straining to urinate (trying to go without success). The urine may be dark brown or blood-tinged. Blood may drip from the penis. If the prostate is enlarged, it could be pressing on the colon, which collects feces (poop), making it difficult for him to poop. You may notice that your dog positions himself to defecate more frequently or takes a long time to poop. Sometimes the symptoms are less obvious. You may notice that your dog is losing weight or appears thinner. He may eat less or skip multiple meals. He may also lay around more or have trouble walking. In early stages of prostate cancer, your dog may not show any symptoms at all. Diagnosis If you suspect your dog has prostate cancer, he will need a thorough physical examination by a veterinarian. The vet will assess his overall health, feel his stomach to check for pain and abnormal structures, and perform a rectal examination to feel the prostate gland and any enlarged lymph nodes that could indicate cancer. X-rays will likely be a next step to check the size of the prostate and look for any other abnormalities such as signs of cancer spread. An abdominal ultrasound will allow the vet to see how the prostate looks and give a better impression of the cancer’s effects on the surrounding organs. Lab work may also be taken to ensure your dog’s internal organs are all working properly and that no changes have occurred. A biopsy (i.e. or removal of a tissue sample) of the prostate is the only sure way to confirm that an abnormal prostate is cancerous. Not all enlarged or abnormal prostates are cancer. A veterinary pathologist will look at the cells from the tissue sample to diagnosis the cancer. Treatment Options Unfortunately, few effective treatment options for dogs with prostate cancer are available. Surgery is not always helpful because the cancer has often spread by the time it is discovered. Postoperative complications from surgery are often problematic for dogs and can include trouble holding urine (urinary incontinence) and narrowing of the urethra to the point of being unable to urinate. Radiation tends to damage the surrounding tissues too much to be useful in most cases. Most chemotherapy drugs and protocols have not been shown to increase a dog’s lifespan. If your dog is diagnosed with prostate cancer, palliative or supportive care can help keep your pet comfortable. Canine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can decrease pain and may also have an anti-cancer effect on prostate cancer. Antibiotics may be needed if urinary tract or prostate infections occur secondary to the cancer. If the prostate becomes large enough to prevent urinating, surgery to enlarge the urethral opening or create a different direction of urine flow may be needed.Quality of Life evaluationand end of life decisions should also be discussed with your veterinarian. Luckily, prostate cancer is rare. Routine veterinary check-ups and physical examinations may lead to finding prostate cancer early. If your pet is showing any unusual signs or symptoms, always call your vet’s office for their advice and/or to schedule a check-up.

Category: Splenic Masses in Dogs (Splenectomy)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is the Spleen for? The spleen is an oblong organ (some would say it is tongue-shaped) seated just below the stomach. Its consistency is similar to that of the liver. While your dog can live perfectly well without a spleen, the spleen does provide some helpful services to the body. Nature's Blood Bank The spleen contains many long, narrow blood vessels that are full of hairpin turns through which circulating red blood cells must go. This means that there are a lot of red blood cells working their way gradually through the spleen at any given time, effectively making the spleen a storage area for blood. If one has a severe hemorrhage and needs extra blood, the involuntary muscles of the spleen contract, squirting forth a fresh supply of blood. The spleen provides nature’s blood transfusion, if you will. Removing old Brittle Red Blood Cells Older red blood cells become more brittle than their younger counterparts. As they attempt the tortuous route through the spleen, many older red cells do not make it out the other side. These cells rupture while trying to make the tight turns, and their iron is captured and recycled by the spleen. Thus, the spleen helps remove old red blood cells from circulation, which is sort of a clean-up function. Removing Infected Red Blood Cells The spleen also performs a function called pitting where it is able to bite off sections of the red blood cells passing through. Antibodies made by the immune system can coat suspicious portions of a red blood cell, thereby marking the area for "pitting." These suspicious areas are bitten off or "pitted" by cells of the spleen. In this way, the spleen can remove red blood cell parasites from the circulating red blood cells, helping keep cells functioning that otherwise might become irreparably damaged if their infection is allowed to persist. Sometimes entire red cells are removed from the circulation in this way, thus preventing the spread of the red cell parasite inside. This sounds like a good thing, but it can get out of hand. For example, infeline infectious anemia, the spleen commonly removes so many red blood cell portions that the infection is difficult to detect, plus the patient becomes dangerously anemic (not from the actual parasite but because the spleen removed large numbers of infected red blood cells). In severe cases of this condition, the spleen may have to be removed.   Part of the Lymphatic System The above functions take place in what is called the red pulp of the spleen. The spleen also contains what is called white pulp, which is essentially part of the lymphatic system, sort of like a lymph node. It serves the same functions as a lymph node but is connected through the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are centers of activity for the immune system, especially antibody-producing lymphocytes. Material from the local area of the body drains to the lymph node via the lymph vessels and the lymphocytes may or may not become stimulated into reacting depending on what sort of material is collected. A reactive lymph node enlarges (the obvious example is the submandibular nodes that swell when you have a sore throat). The white pulp of the spleen sees material from the circulatory system rather than material from the local lymphatics. Lymphocytes circulate through the splenic white pulp just as they do through the lymphatic vessels, carrying messages involved in the war against body invaders (bacteria, viruses, etc.). Why are Splenic Masses Bad? Most spleens are removed because they have grown a tumor. Tumors can be benign (like the red pulp hemangioma) or malignant (like the red pulp hemangiosarcoma, white pulp mast cell tumor, or white pulp lymphosarcoma). In dogs, most splenic masses are either hemangiomas orhemangiosarcomas, while in cats, they are usually eithermast cell tumorsor lymphosarcomas. Hemangioma and Hemangiosarcoma: The Most Common Canine Splenic Tumors Both these tumors arise from the blood vessels of the red pulp and amount to a bunch of wildly proliferating abnormal blood vessels. Eventually, the growth ruptures, and the spleen bleeds. When a vascular organ like the spleen bleeds, a life-threatening blood loss can result. Unfortunately, the splenic mass is certain to bleed again, and if the spleen is not removed, eventually, the patient will bleed to death. If the splenic tumor is benign, removing the spleen is curative, provided that the patient has not lost too much blood to survive the surgery. Ideally, the mass is detected before it has ever bled, and the spleen is removed at a time when the mass is not actively bleeding. Of course, if the splenic mass IS actively bleeding and cannot be stopped with pressure wraps, removing it becomes an emergency surgery; it is not appropriate to try to wait until the bleeding has stopped. Expect blood transfusions to be necessary before, during, and possibly after surgery. If the splenic tumor is a malignanthemangiosarcoma, the spleen can still be removed to control the bleeding, but the problem is that hemangiosarcoma is an aggressive cancer. By removing the spleen and primary tumor, the patient is probably spared bleeding to death, only to eventually succumb to cancer. Since the decision to go to surgery often hinges on whether or not the tumor is malignant, some effort should be made to make this determination if delaying the surgery can be safely done. Chest radiographs and abdominal ultrasound look for evidence of tumor spread. If there is evidence of tumor spread, the tumor is malignant, and the best control entails removing the spleen and following up with chemotherapy. Many people opt for euthanasia at this point, though newer drugs have held promise. If there is no evidence of tumor spread, it may be possible to effect a permanent cure by removing the spleen, although lack of visible tumor spread does not mean the tumor is benign. A piece of spleen tissue for biopsy will be needed to settle the question of malignancy. How Are Splenic Masses Detected? There are several ways to detect a splenic mass. The first way is by physical examination. A large firm mass in the area of the spleen may be felt with the hands during a routine physical examination. From there, radiographs of the belly see if the mass appears to be on the spleen, and chest radiographs see if there is evidence of cancer spread. Based on these findings, plus basic blood work, a decision for or against spleen removal can be made. Unfortunately, many large dogs are simply too well-muscled for splenic masses to be detected in this way. Another method of detecting a splenic tumor comes from the basic blood panel. An unexplained responsive anemia is discovered. A responsive anemia is typical of bleeding (as opposed to an anemia of chronic disease where red blood cells simply are inadequately produced). An older large breed dog with an unexplained bleed is highly suggestive of a splenic tumor. The next step would be radiographs to see if a mass is apparent, followed by chest radiographs for tumor spread as above. These findings on the blood panel are especially suggestive of a splenic mass if there has been a history of sudden weakness or collapse typical of a recent bleed. Splenic tumors tend to bleed intermittently (and usually insignificantly) prior to a large bleed that produces obvious symptoms. These smaller bleeds are generally enough to alter the blood panel. If blood work is suggestive of a splenic mass, radiographs can be taken to confirm a mass. It can be difficult to determine from the radiograph if the mass is coming from the liver or from the spleen. Choosing Not to Remove the Spleen Unfortunately, eventually, the dog will have a bleed from which he cannot recover. If you think your dog is having a bleed at home, you can apply an ace bandage around the belly in a snug manner to essentially apply pressure to the bleed. This is surprisingly effective and may stave off the inevitable temporarily or until you can get your dog to an emergency hospital for more definitive support, such as a blood transfusion. A Chinese herb called Yunnan Baiyo can assist in blood clotting and may be helpful in minimizing the severity of future bleeds. Chemotherapy may still be an option even if the spleen and its malignant tumor are left behind. A newer approach to chemotherapy, metronomic chemotherapy, focuses on eliminating the tumor's blood supply rather than on killing it directly. Lower doses of chemotherapy drugs are used, which leads to far less potential for side effects. If this is something you are considering, consult an oncologist for the most up-to-date information. Other Reasons to Remove the Spleen We have already mentioned the splenic mass as well as excessive red blood cell removal by the spleen as reasons for splenectomy. There are some other situations where splenectomy may be needed. Bloat(Gastric Dilatation and Volvulus) In this condition, the stomach bloats with gas and twists on its axis, effectively cutting off its circulation. This is a huge emergency, usually requiring surgery. The issue with the spleen is that it rides just below the stomach so that when the stomach twists, the spleen twists along with it. Frequently, the spleen, or part of it, must be removed. Traumatic Rupture of the Spleen If the patient suffers blunt trauma to the abdomen, such as getting kicked by livestock or being hit by a car, the spleen may rupture and bleed dangerously. If a tear in the spleen is small, it may be repaired (sewn together), but if the rupture is severe, it may be easiest to simply remove the whole spleen. Splenectomy The spleen may begin bleeding at any time up until it is actually removed. If this occurs, a blood transfusion is likely going to be needed, either with artificial blood or whole blood, depending on what is available. It is possible that multiple transfusions will be needed. A parameter called the “PCV” (“packed cell volume”) or "hematocrit" will be monitored to ensure that the amount of circulating red blood cells does not fall dangerously low. Ideally, the spleen will not be bleeding at any time during surgery. Some patients must receive blood transfusions prior to splenectomy to ensure they have a reserve of red blood cells in case of surgical bleeding. It may not be known prior to surgery if the tumor is benign or malignant, particularly if there was no time to have an ultrasound before surgery. There is a fair chance that malignancy will be immediately obvious once the belly is opened.

Category: Testicular Cancer in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Testicular tumors are the most common genital tumors found in male dogs. Tumors can grow in one or both testicles. Most types of testicular tumors are malignant. Usually this means that they are cancerous and have the potential to spread and harmfully change the surrounding tissues. Cancerous tumors can also metastasize (spread) to other organs throughout the body. The good news is that although testicular cancer in dogs is technically malignant, unlike other types of malignant tumors, these tend to occur at an older age (i.e. average 10 years of age) and metastasis to other organs is rare. Dogs can develop three main types of testicular cancer (although numerous uncommon cancers can also occur): 1)seminoma, 2)Leydigorinterstitial cell tumor, and 3)Sertoli or sustentacular cell tumor.More than one of these three types can occur in one cancerous testicle, and both testicles can be cancerous but have different types of testicular cancer. Clinical Signs When a dog has testicular cancer, one of his testicles may look or feel abnormal. The affected one may be larger than the normal testicle, or it may have a firm, sometimes painful mass inside that you can feel. If both testicles are cancerous, they may both seem larger than normal; the testicles may be painful; or there might be masses. Some dogs appear to only have one testicle. This likely means that during puppyhood, only one testicle descended or dropped normally, and the other testicle remained in his abdomen or belly. This happenstance is known as cryptorchidism. Cancer of the undescended or cryptorchid testicle is common but will not be obvious by just looking at your pet. Sertoli cell tumors and seminomas are the most common types of testicular cancer found in an undescended testicle. Other signs of cancer can include weight loss, poor appetite, abdominal/belly pain, or a mass in the belly. Some testicular cancers, such as Sertoli cell tumors, produce estrogen, a hormone more commonly associated with female dogs. Dogs with testicular tumors that produce estrogen may develop enlarged mammary glands or breast tissue; hair loss on the dog’s trunk; or dark discoloration to the skin. In some cases, estrogen-producing testicular tumors can also affect the bone marrow, resulting in low red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet counts. In such cases, pallor and acting tired from anemia, excessive bleeding and bruising, and/or fever and infections may occur. Leydig cell tumors can produce an excess amount of testosterone. In such cases, a  dog may develop swelling on his rear near his anus, which may be due to a hernia or enlargement of the perianal glands surrounding the anus. It is important to understand that initially many dogs will not show obvious signs. Also of importance is that not all of the clinical signs described are specifically associated with testicular cancer. Numerous other causes may be the culprit, so further testing may be needed to determine why your dog is having such unusual changes. What to do if you Suspect Testicular Cancer If you think your dog might have testicular cancer, your regular veterinarian will perform a physical examination and check over your dog’s testicles. A rectal examination will check your dog’s prostate gland and feel for enlarged lymph nodes. Palpation or feeling structures inside your dog’s abdomen is also common, as well as checking your dog’s gums and listening to his heart and lungs. If cancer is suspected, x-rays of the belly and chest may be needed to search for more clues of cancer or spread to other organs. Lab work may be done to make sure your pet’s internal organs are functioning correctly or to see what hormones are circulating in the bloodstream. Sometimes an abdominal ultrasound will be needed to look for an undescended testicle or organ metastasis. Treating Testicular Cancer Castration, or basic neutering, is the recommended treatment of choice. Both testicles need to be removed because cancer may be present in both, even if only one is obviously affected. If a pet is cryptorchid, intra-abdominal surgery will be needed to remove the testicle in the abdomen as well as surgery to remove the normal one. A pathologist can assess the testicles after they are removed to determine the type of cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy or radiation can be performed, but the effectiveness will depend on the type and severity of cancer. If your veterinarian is not comfortable treating the type of cancer, you may be referred to a veterinary oncologist. If no evidence of metastasis has occurred and the pet isn't displaying any major tumor-related clinical signs, surgery is often the only treatment needed and your pet will be cured. Only about 15% of testicular tumors metastasize, so the cure rate after surgery is extremely high. Pets that are severely affected by testicular tumors, such as those with bone marrow disease, have a much poorer prognosis. This means that even with surgery, very sick pets may not survive. The sooner surgery can be performed after noticing clinical signs or a change in the testicles, the better your pet’s chances of cure will be.

Category: Fibrocartilaginous Embolism (FCE) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Imagine your dog is happily playing in the yard, jumps up to catch a ball, lands badly, and comes up not just lame but weak or even paralyzed in a back leg. Possibly both back legs. The toes of the affected foot may knuckle under.  Maybe his back tilts downward, his rear legs too weak to rise all the way up. You check him over, trying to find where it hurts, and it simply does not seem to hurt at all. There are many conditions that might fit here, but the neurologic knuckling and the absence of a tender spot suggest a fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE). What is FCE, Anyway? To understand FCE (fibrocartilaginous embolism), one has to understand some anatomy of the vertebral column. The vertebral column consists of numerous small bones called vertebrae that are linked together by joints called intervertebral disks. The disks are similar to the joints that connect arm or leg bones together in many ways. They allow flexibility between vertebrae so that you can arch or twist your back voluntarily, just as you can flex and extend a knee or elbow. The disks are unique as well. A joint of the appendicular skeleton, say a knee or elbow, has a capsule that secretes a lubricating fluid. The bones are capped with smooth cartilage to facilitate frictionless gliding as the surfaces move during flexion and extension. The disk is nothing like this. It is more like a cushion between the end plates of the vertebrae. It is round (hence the name disk) and fibrous on the outside with a soft gelatinous inside to absorb the forces to which the bones are exposed. This jelly-like inside material inside is called the nucleus pulposus, and it is this material that makes up the fibrocartilaginous embolus. The vertebral column provides a bony protective case around the vulnerable spinal cord. The spinal cord is the cable of nerves and nerve connections that transmits messages to and from the brain and controls the reflexes of the body. The spinal cord is fed by a network of spinal arteries. In FCE, somehow the material from the nucleus pulposus, all the way in the center of the disk, gets into a spinal artery. The artery carries the nucleus pulposus material to the spinal cord until the artery becomes too narrow for the nucleus pulposus to go any further. The artery is plugged and the area of spinal cord it is supposed to feed dies. (The nucleus pulposis is "fibrocartilaginous" in nature, and the artery obstruction is an "embolism.") This process is not painful except possibly briefly at first, but recovery is far from guaranteed.  The good news is that after the first 24 hours, the condition is not going to get worse. There are many theories of how disk material might gain access to the arterial blood supply, but no one really knows how this happens. The Typical Patient Any dog can be a victim of FCE,  although about half of the victims are large-breed dogs. Some feel the Miniature Schnauzer has a higher risk for FCE as this breed tends to circulate excess blood fats and cholesterol, which may predispose to embolism.Breeds that are called chondrodystrophic (meaning they have as part of their normal breed conformation dwarf-like characteristics) tend to calcify their disk material, making it too hard to participate in an FCE, and they are thus at lower risk. Such lower-risk breeds include Basset hounds and Dachshunds. Instead, these breeds tend to getType I disk herniation, a different spinal problem but one at least amenable to surgery. Most FCE dogs are young adults between the ages of 3 and 6 years. In one study, 61% were evaluated after some kind exercise injury or trauma. There may be a yelp at the time of the trauma but the injury is generally not painful. There is about a 50:50 chance that the lumbar area of the spinal cord will be affected, which means only the rear legs will be involved. Because the embolism is not generally a symmetrical event, both left and right may not be equally affected. Will My Dog Be Okay? This depends on how much loss of function there is. The good news, as mentioned, is that the loss of function will not progress; after the first 24 hours, the maximum function loss has occurred. Your dog may or may not be able to improve (about 74% of dogs in one study showed some improvement ultimately; other studies show at least 50% of dogs can recover fully) but be prepared for no improvement and ask yourself what kind of care will be needed and can your dog get around. Maximum improvement has generally occurred by 3 weeks after the time of the injury, with some dogs showing some additional slow improvement over months. Many dogs are completely paralyzed. See more information oncaring for a paralyzed dog. Many dogs are simply weak in the affected limbs. They may or may not need assistance in getting around. It all depends on how severe the embolism was and where in the spinal cord it occurred. How Can We Be Sure This Was FCE? Acute neurologic weakness after trauma could also be caused by Type I disk herniation or by spinal cord trauma. In Type I disk herniation, a mineralized intervertebral disk “slips” upward and presses on the spinal cord. The pressure may be relieved with medication (if it is not severe) or surgery may be needed. In either case, the spot where the disk is pressing is painful, and the pain is an important distinguishing feature. Beyond this, with disk disease, abnormalities may be seen when the patient’s back is radiographed, whereas in FCE, the radiographs will appear normal. In some cases, the collapsed disk spaces are not obvious, and more advanced spinal cord imaging is needed. A myelogram involves general anesthesia and injecting dye in the space around the spinal cord. If there is an area of compression, it will be visible, and the patient can then proceed to surgery. In FCE, there is no such compression. As for acute spinal cord trauma, it may not be apparent whether this or FCE has occurred. If the lesion is acute, it is not unreasonable to treat it as an acute spinal injury and see if improvement results. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not yet readily available to most veterinary practices but is likely to become the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of FCE. MRI is able to distinguish embolized areas of the spinal cord from those with swelling or compression as long as at least 72 hours have elapsed from the initial event. Still, absolute confirmation of the FCE diagnosis requires a piece of spinal cord tissue for analysis, and this is not something that would be done in a living patient. For the time being, diagnosis of FCE is made based on the clinical picture of a patient in the appropriate age group with an acute spinal deficit, no other abnormalities on imaging, and no painful areas. FCE is unlikely to be a recurrent condition, so that if a dog has one episode, they are not likely to experience another. Physical Therapy Physical therapy for pets is an emerging field with limited availability, but it can be very helpful in maximizing mobility. This holds true for many orthopedic and spinal conditions, including FCE. Some of the exercises used to assist in rehabilitation are depicted in the pictures below. With any pet physical rehabilitation program, a veterinarian should be on site to direct the plan of action.

Category: Heartworm Treatment for Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources It has been said that the treatment of heartworm infection is something of an art. There are several strategies that can be used depending on the dog's medical condition, including the option of not treating at all. The important concept to realize is that, while there are off label alternative heartworm-killing protocols, the FDA-approved method of killing adult heartworms involves very harsh arsenic-based drugs and killing large adult heartworms is neither simple nor safe. Let's review some of the dangers and options in clearing the body of this parasite. Patient Evaluation Prior to therapy, the heartworm patient is assessed and rated for risk into one of four categories. Important factors include: how many worms are thought to be present based upon the tests performed, the size of the dog, the age of the dog, concurrent health factors, severity of the heart disease, and the degree to which exercise can be restricted in the recovery period. Some hospitals use computerized formulas to categorize heartworm infected patients. The categories into which patients are grouped are as follows: Class I: Lowest Risk.These dogs are typically without symptoms and their infection is a surprise discovery during a routine annual health examination when a positive test comes up. Other blood tests are normal and radiographs show mild changes if any change at all. Class II: Moderately Affected.Healthy dogs with minimal signs as above, occasional coughing, fatigue only with exercise but with radiographs that show definite evidence of heart disease. Lab testing shows mild anemia, urine dipsticks show some protein present but not severe urinary protein loss. Class III: Severely Affected.Dog is suffering from weight loss, cough, difficulty breathing, and blatant damage to the vasculature is apparent on radiographs; lab work reveals a more severe anemia and marked urinary protein loss. The damage to the lung blood vessels from the worms creates extra resistance for the heart to pump against, and often, episodes of collapse occur with exercise. If the damage is severe enough, the heart can actually fail trying to pump through all the clogged-up blood vessels. Class III dogs are expected to die without treatment but are, unfortunately, sick enough that treatment itself is not without risk. Class IV: Caval Syndrome.Dog is collapsing in shock with dark brown urine evident. Heartworms are visible by ultrasound in the AV valve of the right side of the heart, with very abnormal bloodwork. These dogs are dying and can only be saved by the physical removal of adult heartworms via an incision through the jugular vein. If such a dog can be saved from this crisis, further treatment cannot be contemplated until the dog is stable enough to fit into one of the other categories above. In this video (we warn you this is not for the faint of heart), view the physicalremoval of adult heartwormsfrom the jugular vein of a dog with caval syndrome. After knowing what class the patient fits in, treatment can be determined. The dog has three groups of heartworms in their body: microfilariae (basically newborn worms whose parents are living inside the dog in question), newly arrived immature worms (relatively fresh from the mosquito bite and living in the skin tissues), and adult worms themselves. Microfilariae are the first stage larvae (basically the youngest stage). These are the children of the adult worms living in the heart and blood vessels. The mother worm gives live birth (no eggs involved) and the babies swim freely in the host's bloodstream. They must be killed so that they cannot be picked up by mosquitos and transmitted to new dogs.. The newly arrived heartworm larvae, freshly delivered from mosquito bites in the last 3 months. These are third and fourth stage larvae living in the skin. For practical purposes, we will include the L5 larvae in this group. The L5's are old enough to leave the skin tissues and enter the circulation but they are not really mature enough to be called adults. This group of young worms (L3's and L4's in the skin and L5's in the circulation) represent the first 5-7 months of infection. We need to kill them before they reach maturity and begin to wreak havoc on the cardiovascular system of the host. The older L5 larvae and adult worms live inside the heart and pulmonary arteries. This group requires the arsenic compounds for destruction while the other two groups can be killed with less toxic products. Now that it's Staged, Let's Get Rid of it The goal is to get rid of all three groups of worms with as little inflammatory reaction as possible. Since the adult worms are the largest, it is not surprising that their deaths generate the most inflammation. We hope to stage the worm-killing process so that when the time comes to kill the adult worms, there are as few adult worms as possible and the patient should be as healthy as possible going into the process. For the sake of terminology, adulticides are products that kill the adult worms and larvicides kill the immature worms. Stabilization First Expect strict exercise restriction to be needed after adulticide therapy but moderately affected dogs will need restriction from the first. If the dog has heart failure, this will need to be controlled as well. Some dogs will need anti-inflammatory doses of steroids to control the inflammation that stems from the presence of worms. This is often done concurrently with the second step as described below. Killing the Microfilaria and Migrating Worms The next step in treatment is clearing the migrating immature worms. Heartworm treatment is a project that lasts at least a couple of months. We do not want immature worms to mature in that time frame. Since our goal is to have fewer adult worms when the time comes to kill the adult worms, it behooves us to kill the younger worms right off the bat. The tissue-based L3 and L4 larvae are killed by monthly macrocyclic lactone-based heartworm preventive products (avermectins and milbemycin). Killing the L3 and L4 larvae prevents heartworm infection. Some of these products can also kill circulating microfilariae (which need to pass through a mosquito before becoming infective to other animals).  The only FDA-approved product for killing microfilariae after adulticide therapy is Advantage Multi®, which contains moxidectin. Other products can be used for this purpose also, but it should be noted that an anaphylactoid reaction can occur if a large number of microfilariae are killed rapidly with products such as high-dose ivermectin (off-label) or high-dose milbemycin (e.g., Interceptor). This problem has not been noted with Advantage Multi. While low-dose ivermectin products (e.g., Heartgard) will gradually eliminate microfilariae in most dogs, the package insert discourages it for this use. KillingWolbachia Wolbachiais a genus of rickettsial organisms (sort of like bacteria, but not exactly) that live inside heartworms of all developmental stages, but their numbers begin to expand once the young worms reach their infectious stage.Wolbachiaorganisms seem to be protective or beneficial to the heartworms that harbor them, aiding in metabolism and general worm health. WithoutWolbachiacolonization, many female worms are not able to reproduce, and third-stage larvae are not able to infect new hosts. Wolbachiaorganisms possess inflammatory surface proteins that are released when adult worms die or are killed in treatment, and these proteins greatly increase the chances of severe circulatory reactions in the canine host. It has been found that killingWolbachiawith an antibiotic such asdoxycyclineis helpful in treating the heartworm infection as theWolbachiacan be removed from their heartworm hosts, thereby weakening the worm and minimizing the release of inflammatory proteins when the worm finally dies. To minimize reactions, the American Heartworm Society recommends using doxycycline along with heartworm preventives for a good month as soon as the diagnosis is made and prior to the use of the arsenic compounds needed to kill the adults. Killing the Adult Worms he only product currently available for treating adult heartworms is melarsomine dihydrochloride (Immiticide®or Diroban®. If you go by the manufacturer's recommendations, treatment can be done in two or three doses, depending on the class of heartworm infection. Most universities, however, opt to treat all patients with the three-dose protocol as it creates a more gradual kill of the adult worms (which is safer in terms of embolism and shock). The patient receives an intramuscular injection deep in the lower back muscles. This is a painful injection with a painful substance, and it is common for the patient to be quite sore at home afterward. Pain medication may be needed. Be careful around the injection site, as the pet may bite. The site may form an abscess that requires warm compresses. Approximately 30% of dogs experience some injection site reaction. These generally resolve in 1-4 weeks. In the two-dose protocol, the dog returns for a second injection the next day on the opposite side of the lower back. In the three-dose protocol, the dog comes back one month later for two doses 24 hours apart (the first dose is an introductory treatment to kill some of the more sensitive worms.) Keep in mind that too many worms dying at once creates circulatory shock. The benefit of the three-dose protocol (sometimes called the split dose protocol) is that the first injection serves to kill off any older or weaker worms without killing off the stronger, younger ones. When the two consecutive doses occur one month later, there will be fewer worms dying at once. After treatment, the patient must be strictly confined for one month following the final treatment. No walks, no running around. The dog must live an indoor life. The reason for this is that embolism, to some degree, is inevitable, and it is important to minimize embolism-related problems. Exercise increases heart rate and oxygen demand, and we need the heart to rest during this recovery period. Watch for: If any of these occur, report them to the vet as soon as possible. The most critical time period is seven to 10 days following a melarsomine treatment, but these signs can occur anytime in the following month. The "Slow Kill Method" with Ivermectin Only Melarsomine treatment is expensive and often out of reach for rescue groups, shelters, and many individuals. If the dog is stable (Class I), one option is to simply leave the dog on an ivermectin-based preventive. This option has led to a great deal of misconception about the ability of ivermectin to kill adult heartworms. Let us lay the rumors to rest now: This means that if you opt to treat a heartworm-positive dog with only an ivermectin heartworm preventive, you can expect the dog to remain heartworm-positive for as long as two years and the heartworm disease will be progressing during that time. This is not good for the dog but certainly beats getting no treatment of any kind. The "Slow Kill Method" with Mox-Dox Adding doxycycline to ivermectin has changed the way slow kill works. As the "slow kill" protocol evolved, topical moxidectin has been substituted for ivermectin, and a month of twice daily doxycycline is used to kill theWolbachiabacteria that are so protective of the living heartworms. The result seems to be a much faster slow kill with microfilaria clearing three weeks or so (addressing the resistance in microfilaria issue of slow kill). The adult worms die over 3-4 months, which is similar to the 3-dose protocol (1-3 months on preventive, one dose of melarsemine with two doses following a month after that). Exercise restriction is still needed, and relatively high doses of moxidectin are also needed. (The topical product is essential; long-acting injectables wane too quickly). Heartworm antigen testing is performed nine months after starting the protocol and continued monthly until negative. If the dog is still heartworm antigen positive after 15 months, new decisions should be made (do mox-dox again, use melarsomine, etc.) The American Heartworm Society views this protocol as a salvage procedure, meaning that it could be considered for a dog for whom melarsomine is not an option. Research and controversy continue with regard to this method.

Translating Return to English Unless you are familiar with the anatomy of the heart, its outflow tracts, and the aorta itself, some basic explanation helps to understand subaortic stenosis and why it is bad. Subaortic stenosis (also simply called SAS) is a scar-like narrowing, which is called a stenosis, located under the aortic valve. Let's back up a bit and cover how things are supposed to work in the heart. Let's Start with the Normal Situation The heart sits more or less centrally in the chest and is divided into a left side, which receives oxygen-rich blood from the lung and pumps it to the rest of the body, and a right side, which receives “used“ blood from the body and pumps it to the lung to pick up fresh oxygen. Because the left side of the heart must supply blood to the whole body, its muscle is especially thick and strong. Blood is pumped from the left ventricle (the pumping chamber) to a particularly large blood vessel called the aorta, the body’s largest artery. The valve that separates the left ventricle from the aorta is called the aortic valve. The left ventricle narrows as it leads to the aorta, and this area is called the left ventricular outflow tract. In subaortic stenosis, the left ventricular outflow tract just below the aortic valve has a scar-like narrowing called a stenosis. This means that the left ventricle must pump extra hard to get the correct blood volume through the narrowed area. The high-pressure blood squirts through in a turbulent fashion, which creates a sound known as a heart murmur. Any cause of turbulent blood flow can be heard as a murmur; a murmur does not always indicate disease, but a murmur is usually the first sign that the puppy in question might have SAS. The most commonly affected breeds for SAS include the Golden Retriever, Rottweiler, Newfoundland, Great Dane, Boxer, German Shepherd, German Short-haired pointer, and Dogue de Bordeaux. When a puppy with SAS is born, the stenosis is very small, barely a ridge near the valve, but over the first six months of life, the stenosis grows, and the murmur (hopefully) becomes more apparent. The murmur is best heard on the left side of the chest at the level of the base of the heart, right over the aortic valve. The louder the murmur, the worse the obstruction of the valve. The murmur is famous for radiating its sound up the carotid arteries of the neck, making a murmur that can be heard with a stethoscope unusually far forward. Over time, the muscle of the left ventricle thickens and grows due to the excess work it must perform. Eventually, this interferes with the pumping chamber’s flexibility and ability to fill. Abnormal muscle in the heart makes for abnormal electrical conduction in the heart and soon the heart’s normal electrical rhythm is disrupted. Since pumping and filling are highly coordinated electrically, when this coordination is lost, fainting spells or even sudden death during exercise can result. Most dogs with SAS do not survive beyond age 3 years without treatment, though dogs with milder cases can have normal life spans. A dog with SAS is always predisposed to electrical arrhythmia, heart failure, and infection of the abnormal aortic valve. The disease is mildest when the puppy is really young and gets worse over the first 6 to 12 months of life. Recognizing the Disease Obviously, the pup is not going to receive proper management unless the condition is recognized. The first step is hearing the murmur. As mentioned, the murmur is the sound made by turbulent blood flow. In other words, a murmur is a sound that might or might not indicate heart disease. Puppies under the age of six months sometimes demonstrate what are called innocent murmurs, which are simply temporary turbulent blood flow. Innocent murmurs should disappear by age six months so that any murmur that persists beyond this time should be pursued as potentially abnormal. This does not mean that you should wait until the puppy is six months of age to attempt diagnosis. The sooner a diagnosis is made, the sooner treatment can begin, and a valid prognosis can be given. There are some size limitations with regard to the equipment needed to assess the puppy, however. Your veterinarian will guide you as to when it is best to pursue the next step in diagnostics. After the Murmur Radiographs are helpful in assessing any evidence of heart failure and may even show a dilation of the aorta near the valve (caused by the high-pressure squirt of blood through the narrowing). This said, the real key to diagnosis is ultrasound, or echocardiography, where chamber sizes and heart wall thickness are measured. Generally, the cross-sectional area of the left ventricle outflow tract is compared to that of the aorta in a ratio to assess the severity of the stenosis. This information is generally adequate to confirm the diagnosis, though a mild case might have values that overlap the normal range. Such a patient might have to be followed over time. One of the most important aspects of the echocardiography evaluation is the Doppler study. This involves measuring the pressure difference across the stenosis, which essentially tells us how hard the heart is working to eject blood through the narrowing. This information is correlated with survival time and the need for treatment. A pressure difference of 40 mm of Hg (pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, abbreviated mm of Hg) is mild whereas a pressure difference of 80 mm of Hg is severe. Mildly affected dogs may not require treatment at all. Treatment: Drugs The goal of treating SAS is to create normal exercise tolerance and a normal life span. The most popular class of drug for SAS are the beta blockers. Beta receptors are the neurologic areas on the heart that respond to adrenaline (we call it epinephrine now) and cause the heart rate to speed up during exercise. In SAS, this kind of racing pulse is what leads to the abnormal electrical rhythm and, ultimately, to fainting. The beta blockers keep the heart from racing. In one study, dogs with SAS treated with a beta blocker calledatenololhad a median survival of 56 months vs. 19 months for dogs receiving no treatment. Treatment: Exercise Restriction Fatal heart rhythm episodes in SAS patients are associated with excitement and demanding exercise (though sudden death can certainly occur without either situation). It is probably best to avoid strenuous exercise if possible. Treatment: Surgery Open heart surgery is uncommonly performed in dogs, but it is possible to surgically excise the collar of scarring that is narrowing the outflow tract. You would think this would solve the whole problem, but in fact, resulting survival times are similar to those for dogs simply taking atenolol. Treatment: Balloon Valvuloplasty With balloon valvuloplasty, the patient is anesthetized, and a catheter is threaded into the heart so that it spans the stenosis. The catheter has a tough balloon at the end, which is then inflated, breaking down the scarring and dilating the stenosis. Again, you would think that this would solve the problem, but survival times are similar to those for dogs simply taking atenolol. At this time, invasive procedures cannot be recommended over medication. More complete studies in the future may change. Subaortic stenosis is a genetic disease. Because inheritance is not simple, dogs with mild disease may produce puppies with severe disease. No dog with subaortic stenosis of any degree should be bred.

Category: Brushing your Dog's Teeth
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What would happen if you stopped brushing your own teeth? Even if you only ate hard food, as most dogs do, there still would be problems. You should be brushing your dog's teeth twice daily if you can manage it; it’s not as difficult as you might imagine. What are the benefits of brushing? Brushing removes daily accumulation of plaque from the teeth. Even though dogs do not commonly get cavities, they do suffer from periodontal disease. If untreated, gum disease can lead to bad breath, pain, and tooth loss. How Do You Brush Your Dog's Teeth? Step oneis to pick an appropriate pet toothbrush. Save yourself time by not buying a child's toothbrush, which is usually too hard for dogs. The ideal dog toothbrush will have a long handle, an angled head to better fit the mouth, and extra soft bristles. For dogs less than 30 pounds, a finger toothbrush that fits over the tip of your finger works well. Step twois to select an appropriate toothpaste. The best pet toothpastes contain enzymes that help control plaque. Try to avoid toothpastes with baking soda, detergents, or salt that are sometimes found in human pastes. Fluoride may be incorporated to help control bacteria. Place the toothpaste between the bristles as this allows the paste to spend the most time next to the teeth and gums. Step threeis to get the brush with paste into your dog's mouth to get all the teeth brushed. Most dogs accept brushing if they are approached in a gentle manner. If you can start when they are young, it's quite easy, but even older pets will accept the process. Start slowly; you can use a damp washcloth or piece of gauze to wipe the teeth, front and back in the same manner you will eventually be using the toothbrush. Praise your dog during the process and offer teeth-healthy treats, such as dental chews, as a reward. Do this twice daily for two weeks, or until your dog is familiar with the approach. Then take the pet toothbrush, soak it in warm water and start brushing daily for several days. When your dog accepts this brushing, add the pet toothpaste. Most attention should be given to the outside of the upper teeth. The toothbrush bristles should be placed at the gum margin where the teeth and gums meet at a 45-degree angle. The movement should be in an oval pattern. Be sure to gently place the bristle ends into the area around the base of the tooth as well as into the space between the teeth. Complete ten short back and forth motions, then move the brush to a new location. Cover three to four teeth at a time. Dog home dental care should include daily brushing using an enzymatic pet toothpaste and a proper toothbrush.  Taking an active role in your dog's dental care will help reduce dental disease, bad breath, and potentially life-threatening heart and kidney disease.

Category: Cleft Palate or Lip in Puppies and Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Congenital clefts in the palate or lip are birth defects that puppies and kittens can get in the tissues connecting parts of the mouth.Human babiesalso get them. These cleft defects happen when the roof of the mouth does not close correctly before the baby is born. Cleft lipis a defect of the lips, underlying bone, and/or front area of the roof of the mouth, also known as a hard palate. Oftentimes, part of the lip will be missing or misshapen. Sometimes, one or both nostrils appear to connect directly to the mouth. Cleft lip may also be called a harelip because the face appears similar to that of ahare’s. Cleft palateis a malformation or disconnection of the tissues that form the roof of the mouth. The soft palate towards the back of the mouth can be involved. A hole may be in the palate because the tissues never fully connected to each other while the fetus was developing. Severe palate defects result in holes from the palate that connect directly to the nasal passages. The big problem with a cleft lip or palate is that it is difficult, if not impossible, for the affected puppy or kitten to latch on properly to a nipple and therefore they cannot eat properly. Depending on the severity of the cleft, the infant may not be able to get sufficient nourishment at an age where lack of nutrition can completely compromise the infant’s health and ability to grow. Causes Many conditions and issues can cause cleft defects. Congenital clefts can be an inherited birth defect; genes may be passed from the mother or father to the developing fetus. Because of this, pets with a cleft lip or cleft palate should not be bred as they have a high likelihood of passing on the cleft genes to their offspring. Occasionally there are other causes, such as trauma during fetal development. During pregnancy, too little folic acid or too much vitamin A given to the mother can result in cleft defects, although that is rare. Many medications, if given to a pregnant cat or dog, may also cause cleft birth defects. These include steroids such as prednisone, aspirin, anti-seizure drugs, and griseofulvin. Certain viral infections or illnesses can lead to congenital clefts in puppies and kittens if the mother is sick while pregnant. Luckily, most of these issues are rare. Signs Signs are not always obvious, especially if the defect is minor. An abnormal appearance to the lip may be visible, or you may not even see any problems because they are so far back in the mouth. Animals with severe defects where the mouth connects to the nose may have nasal discharge. Milk, saliva, and/or food may come out of the nose during or after feeding. If food material gets lodged in the nasal passage way, nasal discharge may be green or mucus-like. In addition to signs of cleft, signs of complications can be seen at home. If the cleft connects with the nasal cavity, the puppy or kitten may cough when trying to eat or drink. Pneumonia can occur due to cleft palates or cleft lips: trouble chewing and properly swallowing food can lead to food or milk in the lower airways and lungs instead of the stomach. Pneumonia will also result in coughing as well as trouble breathing. For those who appear to eat well enough on their own, poor growth, decreased activity level, and slow development may result from not getting enough nutrition. Diagnosis Your veterinarian will do a thorough physical examination. Sedation is sometimes needed for a good look in the mouth. If the pet has symptoms of pneumonia, X-rays and lab work may be needed. If surgery is planned, advanced imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, may be necessary but that is rare. Treatment Cleft lips that do not connect the mouth directly to the nose can be left alone if they do not cause any symptoms. However, for those with symptoms, surgery is usually needed. Without surgery, food can get stuck in the malformed areas, leading to serious infections. In severe cases, pets with cleft palates can’t eat or swallow properly, and will become ill from lack of nutrition. Unfortunately, surgery is costly, and multiple attempts may be needed to close the defect. Most surgeons recommend waiting until the puppy or kitten is older and strong enough to handle anesthesia, if the pet can wait that long. If surgery is delayed,tube feeding(either through a tube inserted into the back of the mouth, through the nose, or directly into the stomach) may be necessary to help keep up with the growing baby’s nutritional needs. Treatment for associated respiratory diseases may require hospitalization where the infant can get IV fluids and IV or oral antibiotics. Prognosis If a pet has no signs, it may survive and live on to be a healthy adult. Improvement from surgery is not guaranteed, and chances of survival are decreased if the pet is sick or if the symptoms are severe. If you are a breeder, call your veterinarian for a checkup if you notice your puppies or kittens have a facial deformity, have trouble drinking milk, cough or spit up frequently, or do not thrive like the rest of the litter. Also call your veterinarian if you see similar signs in your new puppy or kitten. Early intervention can prevent some of the issues associated with clefts such as infections and may help improve your pet’s chances for a healthy outcome.

Category: Clinical Signs of Oral or Dental Disease in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you see any of these clinical signs, take your pet to your veterinarian for a complete oral examination.  Your veterinarian may need to sedate or anesthetize your pet, in order to complete the examination..  Dental radiographs (X-rays), not “skull films” (a radiograph of the entire head) may be necessary in order to make a proper diagnosis.  Intra-oral radiographs are essential for deciding what’s going on and what needs to done.  If your veterinarian is unable to take dental radiographs, is unsure of a diagnosis, or if the treatment is beyond the clinic’s level of dental experience, ask for a referral to a veterinarian who has an advanced certification in dentistry. (SeeAmerican Veterinary Dental CollegeorAcademy of Veterinary Dentistry). Preventive care involves brushing and daily examination of your pet’s mouth. Brushing needs to be done at least 3 to 4 times a week, if you want to make a difference in your pet’s oral health.  Plus, by looking in your pet’s mouth while you are brushing, you will be more aware of any oral abnormalities (oral masses, bad breath, missing teeth) or the increased redness of the gums that indicates periodontal disease and the need for a trip to the “Animal Dentist.” By working with your primary-care veterinarian and a dental specialist, you are sure to increase your companion’s quality of life by providing proper and timely dental and oral healthcare.

Category: Dental Care and What to Expect
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Root canals, dental x-rays, braces, crowns, caps, implants, and periodontal surgery for pets? You must be kidding! Not at all. Dental procedures are performed daily in veterinary practices. How does a loving pet owner know if dental care is needed, and where can a pet owner go for advanced dental care? Examination is the key to diagnosis and helps determine the type of treatment needed. The veterinarian needs to know what to look for. A pet owner can help by examining their pet's teeth and mouth at least monthly. First, smell your pet’s breath. If you sense a disagreeable odor, your pet may have gum disease. Periodontal disease is the most common ailment of small animals and is treatable.  Gum problems begin when bacteria accumulate at the gumline around the tooth. Unless brushed away daily, these bacteria can destroy tooth-supporting bone, and cause bleeding, and tooth loss. Usually, the first sign is bad breath. If your pet is experiencing frequent pain or refusing to eat, has changed chewing habits, or has moderate to severe mouth odor, then an oral problem is probably the cause. When examining your pet's mouth, look for tooth chips or fractures on the tooth's surface. Contrary to their popularity, chewing on cow hooves, antlers, rocks, bones, or other hard materials may break teeth. If the fracture is deep you may notice a red, brown, or black spot in the middle of the tooth's surface. The spot is the tooth’s nerve and inside vessels, which when exposed to the oral cavity may eventually lead to a tooth painful abscess. When your home exam reveals dental problems or if you are still uncertain, a trip to the veterinarian is in order. The veterinary oral examination will begin with a complete visual examination of the face, mouth, and each tooth. Frequently pets' mouths have several different problems that need care. The veterinarian will usually use a record chart similar to the one used by human dentists to identify and document such dental problems. A more detailed exam then follows. Unfortunately, cats and dogs cannot point to dental abnormalities with their paws, and to determine the proper treatment plan, other tests are usually necessary. General anesthesia is essential for a proper tooth-by-tooth evaluation. There is a wide array of safe and effective anesthetics and monitoring equipment that make anesthesia as safe as possible. Expect your veterinarian or dental assistant to use a periodontal probe to measure gum pocket depths around each tooth. One or two millimeters of probe depth normally exists around each tooth. When dogs or cats are affected by periodontal disease, the gums bleed and probing depths may increase, which requires additional care to save the teeth. Unfortunately by the time some pets come in for dental care, it is too late to save all of the teeth. Your veterinarian may also take x-rays of the entire mouth. X-rays show the inside of the tooth and the root that lies below the gum line. Many decisions are based on x-ray findings. Usually, the veterinarian will visually examine the mouth, note any problems, take X-rays under anesthesia, and then tell you what needs to happen to treat the problems found if any. Plaque removal and preventative care with periodic checkups should help hinder the loss of additional teeth. Plaque and tartar preventative products can be found at theVeterinary Oral Health Council. If your dog or cat needs advanced dental care, where can you go? Many veterinarians have taken post-graduate dental training in order to better serve their patients. Some veterinarians have passed advanced written and practical examinations given by the American Veterinary Medical Association, which certifies them as dental specialists. If you need one, your veterinarian can refer you. Dogs and cats do not have to suffer the pain and discomfort of untreated broken or loose teeth or infected gums. With the help of thorough examinations, x-rays, dental care, and daily plaque prevention, your pet can keep his teeth in his mouth where they should be.

Category: Epulis Tumor in Dogs' Mouths
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Epulides/epuli (plural of epulis) are common benign growths found in dogs' mouths. There are three types: Fibromatous epulisappears on a stalk of tissue, much like a mushroom, or as an unmoving mass. It is usually pink in color and has a non-ulcerated smooth surface. It may appear as an enlargement on the gum tissue near incisor, canine, or premolar teeth. Peripheral odontogenic fibroma(previously called ossifying epulides) is similar in appearance to a fibromatous epulis as it also has a pink smooth surface, but it has an osteoid matrix; it's made up of early-stage bone cells known as osteoblasts. Acanthomatous ameloblastoma(previously called acanthomatous epulis) is classified as benign but it tends to invade adjacent bone and it is locally aggressive. It can be pre-cancerous. However, it does not spread to other regions of the body. This tumor often has a rough cauliflower-like, ulcerated surface. It occurs most commonly in the incisor and canine tooth area of the lower and upper jaw. It occurs less commonly near the fourth upper premolar in the upper jaw and the lower jaw's first molar. Statistics Epulis is the fourth most common tumor found in the canine mouth. It is very rare in cats. This tumor is more common in brachycephalic breeds. Brachycephalic breeds are those that have a very short nose and muzzle. Boxers and English Bulldogs are brachycephalic dog breeds, for example. Middle-aged and older dogs get epulides more often than young dogs do. The average age of an affected dog is seven years old. The overgrowths are generally a reaction to trauma, such as a tooth rubbing on the gum in brachycephalic mouths, for example. Clinical Signs Signs include a lump on the gums, drooling, halitosis, facial deformity, and other signs of mouth injury. The visible lump is the most common sign. Diagnosis Diagnosis begins with a visual examination of the mouth. Radiographs of the head can determine how invasive the tumor is. Biopsy and histopathological (microscopic) examination of the lump will determine which type of epulis is present. Treatment Fibromatous epulis: Treatment involves removing the mass, extracting the involved tooth, and thoroughly scraping the tooth socket clean. Peripheral odontogenic fibroma: Treatment involves removing the mass, extracting the involved tooth, and thoroughly scraping the tooth socket clean. This surgery can be more difficult than that for fibromatous epulis. Acanthomatous ameloblastoma: Treatment is surgical removal, including removing the affected areas of the upper or lower jaw (maxillectomy or mandibulectomy). In some inoperable epulis cases, radiation therapy may help. Aftercare After surgery, your pet may need a softer diet. Your veterinarian will advise you about this. Prognosis The less tissue involved, the better. If a large section of the jaw has to be removed, it can affect the dog's quality of life. The oral tumors don't usually recur if the entire tumor has been removed. However, some can. Checking your dog's mouth frequently will help you spot any tumor recurrence or new tumors.

Category: No Bones About It - Chewing Bones is Bad for Dogs' Teeth
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   The Food and Drug Administration warned pet owners about bones and bone treats to include not only harmful bacteria (E.coliandSalmonella) that dogs can get and pass on to humans but the actual damage caused by the bone's trauma to a dog’s teeth. Other issues can occur with bones, such as blocked intestines, choking, wounds in the mouth, vomiting/diarrhea, and rectal bleeding (some of which could be fatal if not treated promptly). Are Any Bones Safe for My Dog's Teeth? No. Steak bones are too hard for teeth. Antlers are worse than bones because they're even harder. Poultry bones - chicken, turkey, and duck - are awful because they are full of air and thus splinter easily. The pieces can get stuck in your dog's palate (roof of the mouth) and cause infection or get stuck in the esophagus or intestines, most of which requires a surgical fix. What Happens if My Dog’s Teeth Are Injured by Bones? How Will I Know if There is a Problem? For many dogs, broken teeth do not show signs of discomfort even though they experience pain like humans. Some show apparent signs and symptoms of disease, including an open tract below the eye or under the chin that may be draining. When the nerves die, the pain decreases until infection sets in. Signs relating to dental disease from a broken tooth include: Treatment for Broken Teeth When presented with a tooth that is fractured and has pulp exposure (complicated tooth fracture), your veterinarian essentially has two choices: Types of Tooth Damage How Severe is the Damage to the Tooth? Some fractures are limited to the enamel and require little or no therapy; others involve dentin and might not require endodontic care; others expose enamel, dentin, and pulp and require root canal care or extraction. The goal of endodontic care is to return the tooth to function if possible, and if not, extract the tooth to prevent further pain. How Important is the Tooth? The upper and lower canines (eye teeth) are the most common teeth broken, followed by the incisors and the upper cheek teeth. Although endodontic care can be performed on any tooth, the canines and maxillary fourth premolars generally are the only teeth where endodontic therapy would be considered due to the importance of the tooth and ease of pulp chamber access. Age of the Patient The age of the patient is also essential when choosing endodontic therapy options. Canine teeth of patients younger than twelve months of age may have open root apices (the tip of the tooth's root). Lower molar teeth generally have closed apices by seven months of age. Standard root canal therapy is not performed on teeth with open root apices because appropriate sealing of the apex cannot be assured. Treatment options for teeth with open root apices include: Age of the Fracture The age of the fracture affects endodontic treatment. Inflammation occurs less than two mm from the exposure site shortly after pulp exposure. In acute (sudden) fractures, the pulp appears pink or red at the fracture surface. The pulp of a long-standing fracture will appear brown or black. Healthy pulp tissue can be found several millimeters deeper within the pulp, which might respond to vital pulp procedures (i.e., vital pulp therapy). In the mature animal that has an acutely fractured tooth with a closed apex, standard root canal therapy results in a more predictable outcome compared to vital pulp therapy. Aftercare Support Tooth support is critical to the long-term success of endodontic treatment. If obvious periodontal disease is present before therapy, victory will be unlikely unless epic measures are taken, and strict home care is provided. Dogs love to chew. To find out what products are safe and effective in decreasing the accumulation of plaque and tartar, discuss with your veterinarian.

Category: Orthodontics for Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Just as you would want to cure a painful skin condition or sore joint in your pet, consider relieving pain in your pet's mouth. When an oral problem is caused by poorly aligned teeth, orthodontic treatment may be needed. Orthodontics for pets is not frivolous and is seldom performed for cosmetic purposes. Orthodontic procedures are the tools used to improve dental function and reduce pain. Teeth that are crowded, rotated, or tilted at abnormal angles can result in: Genetic or Not? Occlusion is the way in which teeth align with each other. Occlusion is controlled by genetics, nutrition, environment, and by mechanical forces generated by the interlock of the upper and lower teeth. Some abnormal bites (malocclusions) are genetically influenced, such as severe over or under bites and wry bites. Other bite abnormalities are known to be acquired (non-genetic). Acquired malocclusions can result from tug of war games played with towels or ropes that move teeth into an abnormal position. Traumatic birthing can also be responsible for some acquired abnormalities. To help define whether the malocclusion is genetic in origin, interdigitation of the premolars is studied. In breeds that have medium and long muzzles, the premolars should meet in a saw toothed fashion. For example, the tip of the lower third premolar should be positioned equally between the crowns of the upper third and fourth premolars. If the tip of one premolar points to the tip of another premolar, there may be a genetically-induced malocclusion. This only holds true in breeds that do not have shortened muzzles. Some genetic bite problems do not show up in each litter because they are passed on recessively. The goal of selective breeding is to mate one animal to another that has superior occlusion. Retained Deciduous Teeth Normally the root of the deciduous (baby) tooth is reabsorbed, making room for an adult tooth. Should this fail, the adult tooth may move from its normal position, resulting in malocclusion. The resulting double set of teeth overcrowds the dental arch, causing food to become trapped between the teeth, which lead to early periodontal disease. A double set of roots may also prevent normal development of the socket and erode periodontal support around the adult tooth, resulting in early tooth loss. A retained deciduous tooth should be extracted as soon as an adult tooth is found in the same area as the baby tooth. If the extraction is performed early, the abnormally positioned adult tooth usually moves to its normal location.Some breeders trim or cut deciduous teeth in the hope that they will be shed early and prevent orthodontic problems. When the tooth is cut in half, pulp is exposed to oral bacteria causing infection, pain, and tooth loss. Unfortunately, the remaining infected root can interfere with the emerging adult tooth, which may not come in normally. Dental Interlock Jaws do not grow at equal rates. If deciduous (baby) teeth erupt during an accelerated growth phase of one jaw, both sets of primary teeth can interlock and result in an abnormal bite. Even genetically normal dogs can occasionally develop abnormal bites due to the interlock of primary teeth. If an under bite is noted before the permanent teeth erupt, treatment may be helpful. Removing the primary teeth (from the shorter jaw) that are interfering with the forward jaw growth may allow the upper jaw to lengthen unimpeded, if the procedure is performed by 10 weeks of age. This procedure, called interceptive orthodontics will correct about 50% of minor jaw length malocclusions by the time permanent teeth erupt. Extracting teeth does not stimulate jaw growth; it only removes a mechanical barrier to genetic control of the growth process. Breeders, show judges, veterinarians, and others who wish to describe specific dental conditions in dogs and cats should use proper orthodontic terms. Over bite, open bite, over jet, level bite, overshot, under bite, anterior cross bite, posterior cross bite, wry bite, and base narrow canines are orthodontic terms that are confusing at times. Missing or Extra Teeth Dogs and cats may be born without the proper number of teeth. The overcrowding from extra (supernumerary) teeth can cause periodontal disease. The American Kennel Club sets acceptable standards for show dogs about the minimum number of teeth for each breed. Dental x-rays can be taken as early as 10 weeks of age to evaluate if the dog has the correct number teeth. X-rays are recommended as a part of the prepurchase examination in certain breeds. Missing teeth (hypodontia) usually occur in the premolar area, but any tooth in the mouth may not erupt. Missing or extra teeth are considered genetic faults. Collies and Doberman Pinchers are most commonly affected. Sometimes the missing tooth is trapped below the gum line, and a dental x-ray can be taken to determine if there is an unerupted tooth. Misdirected Canine Syndrome Misdirected canine syndrome is a bite abnormality where retention of the deciduous (baby) tooth tilts the erupting permanent canine tooth into an abnormal location. The opposing canines may not have room to occlude properly, resulting in abnormal wear, periodontal disease, or early tooth loss. Occlusion The way in which teeth align with each other is called occlusion. Normal occlusion in most medium and long muzzled breeds consists of the upper (maxillary) incisors that just overlap the lower (mandibular) incisors (scissors bite). The lower canine should be located equidistant between the corner (lateral) incisor and the upper canine tooth. Premolar tips of the lower jaw should point between the spaces of the upper jaw teeth. Malocclusion Malocclusion refers to an abnormal tooth alignment. Over bite (mandibular distoclusion, parrot mouth, over shot, class two, over jet, mandibular brachygnathism) occurs when the lower jaw is shorter than the upper. There may be a gap between the upper and lower incisors when the mouth is closed. The upper premolars are displaced at least 25% toward the front compared to the lower premolars. An over bite malocclusion is not considered normal in any breed and is a genetic fault. The most commonly affected breeds are those with elongated muzzles (Collies, Shelties, Dachshunds, and Russian Wolfhounds). An underbite (mandicular mesioclusion, under shot, reverse scissors bite, prognathism, class III) occurs when the lower teeth protrude in front of the upper jaw teeth. Some short-muzzled breeds (Boxers, English Bull Dogs, Shih-Tzus, and Lhasa Apsos) normally have an under bite, but it is abnormal when it occurs in medium-muzzled breeds. When the upper and lower incisor teeth meet each other edge to edge, the occlusion is considered an even or level bite. Constant contact between upper and lower incisors can cause uneven wear, periodontal disease, and early tooth loss. Level bite is considered normal in some breeds, although it is actually an expression of under bite. Rostral cross bite occurs when canine and premolar teeth on both sides of the mouth occlude normally, but one or more of the lower incisors are positioned in front of the upper incisors. This condition can be caused by tug-of-war games, retained primary teeth, or impacted roots. Anterior cross bite is a common malocclusion. It is not considered a genetic or inherited defect. Posterior cross bite occurs when one or more of the premolar lower jaw teeth overlap the upper jaw teeth. This is a rare condition that occurs in the longer nosed dog breeds. A wry mouth or wry bite occurs when one side of the jaw grows more than the other. Wry bites show as triangular defects in the incisor area. Some of the incisors will meet their opposing counterparts while others will not. Wry bite is a severe inherited defect. Base narrow canines occur when the lower canine teeth protrude inward, often producing damage to the upper palate. This condition is either due to retained deciduous teeth, or by an overly narrow mandible. Base narrow canines may be corrected through orthodontic devices that push the teeth into normal occlusion. An open bite occurs when some incisors are displaced vertically and do not touch.  The tongue will often protrude. Rotated teeth, commonly affecting the upper third premolar, occur mostly in short-muzzled breeds. Selective breeding has created undersized mouths that cannot accommodate 42 teeth in normal alignment. The rotated tooth root closest to the palate is prone to periodontal disease. Strict tooth brushing may be helpful in saving a rotated tooth, but frequently it cannot be saved. Orthodontic Care Many abnormal bites can be corrected. Orthodontic care should be performed by veterinarians familiar with tooth movement principles. Sometimes breeders use rubber bands to move teeth but they compromise the gum tissue around teeth, leading to periodontal disease, pain, and early tooth loss. Orthodontic care should be reserved to ease pet discomfort by realigning teeth in those animals that will not be used for show. Tooth movement is accomplished by employing brackets, acrylic retainers, springs, and elastics. Fortunately, in animals orthodontic movement can usually be accomplished in months rather than years. If your dog's or cat's teeth do not appear to meet normally, have your veterinarian take a peek and make recommendations to help your pet.

Category: Periodontal Disease in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Unfortunately, most adult dogs and cats have periodontal disease. Imagine if you didn't brush your teeth for days, weeks or months. Plaque is a transparent adhesive fluid composed of mucin, sloughed epithelial cells, and aerobic gram-positive cocci. Plaque starts forming within two days after professional dental scaling and polishing. If the plaque is not removed, mineral salts in the food will precipitate to form hard dental calculus (tartar). Rough calculus covered with plaque is irritating to the gingival tissue, changing the pH of the mouth and allowing bacteria to survive subgingivally. By-products of these bacteria harm the tooth's support structures, often causing pain and the tooth to be lost. Every professional dental visit should include probing and charting. A periodontal probe is an important instrument used to evaluate periodontal health. A probe is marked in millimeter gradations and gently inserted in the space between the gingival margin and tooth. A probe will stop where the gingiva attaches to the tooth or at the apex of the alveolus if the attachment is gone. Intraoral radiography supplies important information when deciding which teeth can benefit from surgery and which should be extracted. There are two common grading systems commonly used to classify the degree of periodontal disease. The mobility index evaluates the looseness of the tooth. There are three stages with stage 3 indicating advanced periodontal disease necessitating extraction. Anatomically the periodontium is composed of the gingiva (gum), cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar supporting bone. Periodontal disease can also be staged by the degree of periodontium affected as measured with the periodontal probe and intraoral radiographs. When periodontal disease is not treated, subgingival bacteria can continue to reproduce, potentially creating deeper periodontal pockets through bone destruction. Eventually, this progression can cause tooth loss and systemic disease. Treating Periodontal Diseases    The goal of treating periodontal disease is to decrease or eliminate the periodontal pocket. What needs to be considered when planning periodontal care? The best outcomes result from a committed client, a cooperative patient, and a treatable tooth. The client needs to be committed to saving their pet’s teeth. This commitment includes twice-daily plaque control either through brushing, wipes, or products accepted by theVeterinary Oral Health Council. Frequent veterinary dental progress re-examinations and expenses should also be considered and discussed before choosing any surgery. The patient must also be a willing four-legged partner. If the dog or cat will not allow home care, the best dental surgeon and the most caring owner will not make a difference. Unless there is strong owner commitment and patient compliance, it is much wiser to extract a tooth affected by moderate periodontal disease rather than letting the pet suffer. Once the clinician is convinced that he is working on the right patient and tooth, the appropriate type of periodontal surgery is chosen. An ideal method allows exposure of the root surface, preserves the attached gingiva, and allows the gingiva to be resutured in a fashion to eliminate the periodontal pocket promoting reattachment to the root surface. At one time gingivectomy was the treatment of choice to eliminate pocket depth and allow exposure of the root surface for cleaning. Unfortunately, part of the important attached gingiva is sacrificed in the gingivectomy procedure. Gingivectomies should only be used in cases of gingival hyperplasia where there is an overgrowth of tissue or when mucogingival surgery to preserve the attached gingiva is not practical.

Category: Teeth Chattering in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Teeth chattering in dogs can be caused by several different things. Some veterinarians believe that the source of teeth chattering is usually dental or oral (mouth) pain until proven otherwise. An abscess, broken teeth, or gingivitis can cause pain; even some ulcerations or growths that don’t touch the teeth can cause chattering as a response to that pain. Dogs can also suffer from pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). A dog with arthritis around that joint or who has or has had a jaw fracture may chatter their teeth in response to that pain. Teeth can rub together if the jaw is clenched or from grinding the teeth. Imaging such as X-rays or computed tomography (CT) (both done under anesthesia) may be recommended to help your veterinarian better visualize what is happening in the jaws or mouth. Even though the most common cause is somewhere in the mouth, the source can be elsewhere, including the gastrointestinal tract, or involving a neurologic disease. In some greyhounds, and likely in some other breeds, it’s a relatively common sign of anxiety and often ends as the cause of anxiety ends, such as a veterinary appointment. Generally, the first step in treatment is a tooth-by-tooth exam under anesthesia with dental imaging, either X-rays or a CT scan. Tooth Resorption Tooth resorption is when the dentin, or the harder outside of a tooth, is inflamed and disintegrating. Teeth need to be evaluated closely for any tooth-resorbing lesions, as oral lesions may not be visible even on dental radiographs. Identifying tooth resorption can be difficult, and choosing which teeth to pull requires experience and judgment. You and your veterinarian should discuss whether referral to a veterinary dentist is in your pet’s best interest. Gastrointestinal Issues With some gastrointestinal issues, dogs may become nauseous, vomit, drool, or have gastroesophageal acid reflux. Lab work and imaging, such as ultrasound or endoscopy (a camera scope fed into the GI tract) or surgery, might be recommended. In cases caused by gastrointestinal issues, medications may help stop the chattering within the first week. Focal Seizures Focal seizures are sometimes a neurological cause of teeth chattering. A focal seizure is a type of seizure that only affects a certain area in one half of the brain, not both halves. A dog with focal seizures may chatter their teeth or display what may be referred to as “fly-biting behaviors,” where they snap at the air as if chasing an insect. However, unlike other causes of teeth chattering, a dog experiencing focal seizures will not respond to you as they normally would when you call them by name, make noise, or so on, and they may seem to stare off into space. Before this type of seizure, your dog may act unusual, such as walking back and forth or clinging to you. If your dog stops chattering their teeth during a short trial of anti-epileptic drugs, the cause of the chattering is likely related to the seizures. Other less common causes of teeth chattering exist, such as pain in other parts of the body or even hormonal changes. A physical examination and consultation with your trusted family veterinarian, along with appropriate testing, can help pinpoint the cause of chattering and help guide treatment. Additionally, taking videos for your veterinarian and listing all signs can be helpful to get them started on the best diagnostic path for your pet.

Category: Tooth Resorption in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Tooth resorption is a progressive disease that leads to loss or destruction of teeth. It is somewhat common in dogs, but we usually can’t see it with the naked eye. Instead, we often observe it through X-rays of the teeth. Tooth resorption can be painful and uncomfortable for your dog and can lead to infection and death of the tooth. Thus, it is important to diagnose and treat it.  It is helpful to go over basic tooth anatomy before we describe tooth resorption in greater detail. The figure shows the parts of the tooth described. A dog’s tooth sits within a pocket of bone known as the alveolus or bone socket. The crown is the part of the tooth above the gum line, which we can see. The root is the part below the gum line, which we usually can’t see. The crown is covered in enamel, the hardest substance in the body, while the root is covered in a layer of bone-like material called cementum. Underneath these layers is dentin, which surrounds the pulp. The pulp is the innermost layer of the tooth and contains blood vessels and nerves. It is housed within a space in the center of the tooth; this space is called the root canal in the root and the pulp chamber in the crown.   What Causes Tooth Resorption? Despite many theories, the cause isn’t known. However, we do have some understanding of what is happening at a microscopic level. During this disease process, cells calledodontoclastsbreak down the hard tissue of a tooth. This destruction generally begins in the root and progresses from there.  What Are Signs My Dog Has Tooth Resorption? Dogs may not show any signs of disease, especially if resorption only occurs in the root. However, your dog can experience pain and discomfort once resorption occurs above the gum line and exposes the dentin or pulp. At this point, you may notice the following signs: How Will My Veterinarian Diagnose Tooth Resorption? As always, your veterinarian will talk to you about your dog's problem history and perform a physical exam. This information will help the veterinarian rule out other causes and localize the issue to the mouth. Then, your veterinarian will need to take X-rays of your dog’s teeth to confirm they have tooth resorption and figure out which teeth are affected and how severe it is. This will require anesthesia since dogs (unlike humans) do not understand to hold still and not bite through the equipment while X-rays are taken. How is Tooth Resorption Treated? Treatment options include: To decide which treatment plan to pursue, your veterinarian will take into account a number of factors, including how much of the tooth is affected, how severe the resorption is, and where it is. For example, if the crown is affected, your veterinarian must remove the whole tooth to relieve pain. Once this procedure is over, painkillers may be prescribed to relieve discomfort. Assisted feeding might also be necessary until the mouth heals. What Is the Prognosis for Tooth Resorption? Once the affected teeth are removed, dogs generally do well. The prognosis is excellent. Root canal therapy carries a more guarded prognosis, as it may not alter the course of resorption of the tooth.

Category: Actinic (Solar) Dermatitis
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most of us know that sun exposure can be damaging to the skin. We get wrinkles, sunburn, and even sun-induced skin cancers. Dogs have similar issues. Pets like to sunbathe just like people do. Many like to lie happily on their backs and soak up the damaging UVB light. UVB light is pretty unpleasant stuff.  For one thing, UVB light induces the inflammatory response of skin cells, damages the skin’s immune cells, and induces mutations in skin cells of DNA. At first, the skin becomes pimply and red, but then plaques of thick skin develop and spread. Skin cancer can form, and not all forms of skin cancer stay confined to the skin. Dogs at Risk Most of the time, a good fur coat is all the protection a dog needs to avoid damage from the sun. After all, protection from the environment is what fur is all about. There are two problems, however: the tummy (which is sparsely furred in most dogs), and short white fur (which sunlight readily penetrates). This puts the pit bull terrier at special risk but any dog with similar hair length (greyhound, pointer, Dalmatian etc.) can have a problem with too much sun exposure, on the tummy or otherwise. What Does it Look Like? The white fur becomes patchy, and the skin below becomes red and irritated. In contrast, if there are adjacent patches of dark fur, the coat is lush and normal with no patchy hair loss, and the skin underneath is not inflamed. Passing your fingers across the fur from white to colored will yield a dramatic difference in skin texture as the colored fur is protective against the sun. Infection (usually a pimply red rash) is common in many skin conditions, including this one, so sometimes a course of antibiotics can make the underlying sun-induced situation more clear. Biopsy of sun-induced skin damage is very characteristic and should be able to settle any questions. Treatment As long as skin cancer has not actually cropped up, treatment focuses on inflammation and reducing sun exposure. AntibioticsMost actinic dermatitis cases have a hefty secondaryStaphylococcusinfection and need a couple of weeks of antibiotics. Topical SteroidsIf the skin has a lot of inflammation and discomfort, a week or so of topical steroids can relieve this. Be sure to use a product made for animals as human products are not made with the expectation that they will be licked. Vitamin AProtocols using daily Vitamin A have been shown to reduce the development of skin cancer and lessen damage from the sun. Your veterinarian can tell you what to get. PentoxifyllineThis medication can improve circulation to the skin, thus assisting with perfusion and healing. Reduce Sun Exposure!If possible, keep the pet indoors during the hours of 11 a.m.—2 p.m. Pre-Cancer and CancerIf sun-induced dermatitis does not respond to treatment or you find growths or “blood blisters,” a biopsy is probably in order. The biopsy will identify sun-induced tumors as well as skin in a precancerous state. Any tumors should be removed as soon as possible. Any skin in a precancerous state needs attention. Tumors The sun can inducesquamous cell carcinomaorhemangiosarcomain the skin. Surgery is often curative, especially if performed early, but the problem is that multiple areas of tumor can arise, and in an area like the belly, there is only so much skin that can be removed. Your veterinarian will guide you, but many dogs must come in monthly as new skin tumors appear. Small tumors can be removed with a local anesthetic. Your veterinarian will determine your best protocol. You may wish to discuss with your veterinarian whether a referral to an oncologist is in your and your pet’s best interests. PrecancerRemove growths wherever possible and implement some sort of prevention for the rest of the skin, which is undoubtedly in a precancerous state. Obviously, the treatments listed above should be used, but some extra steps may also help. Non-Steroidal Anti-InflammatoriesThese not only help with pain but can also inhibit sun-induced cancers. Never use a human product in your pet without specific instructions from your veterinarian, as many human NSAIDs are toxic to animals. ImiquimodThis is a topical ointment with anti-tumor effects. It can be expensive for a larger dog, but the ointment can cover a large expanse of sun-exposed tummy. This medication should not be licked by your dog, so special wraps may be needed if it is used. If you have a light-coated, short-haired dog, be careful of sun exposure because the fur is likely not enough protection alone. Any “blood blisters” on the skin, especially the tummy, should be seen by the veterinarian. Time in the sun should be fun for everyone, including the family dog.

Category: Adverse Reactions to Spot-on Flea and Tick Products
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Spot-on flea and tick products for dogs and cats have greatly improved the safety and convenience of controlling external parasites on our pets. Using pesticides that are many degrees less toxic and frequently more effective than the organophosphate or carbamate dips and sprays of the past, these spot-on products help keep our pets (and our homes) free of annoying pests that can also carry serious diseases. When used according to the label directions, spot-on products are well tolerated by most pets. However, as with any product that is applied directly on the skin, there is the possibility that certain individuals will have adverse local reactions to one or more ingredients in the product. Some individuals will have similar reactions to many different spot-on products with different active ingredients, suggesting that their sensitivities may be to some of the inactive ingredients. These reactions are restricted to the area of skin that comes in direct contact with the product, so they do not reflect a systemic toxicosis but rather a local hypersensitivity. Skin reactions to spot-on products can vary from mild tingling sensations to actual chemical burns of the skin in especially sensitive individuals. The mildest form of skin reaction to spot-on products is epidermal paresthesia, which is defined as an abnormal sensation such as an itch or prickling of the skin. Paresthesia occurs when the applied product "tickles" the nerve endings in the skin, causing the characteristic sensation. Although paresthesia may occur with any spot-on product, it is most commonly associated with products containing concentrated pyrethroids such as permethrin, cyphenothrin, and etofenprox. Pyrethroid paresthesia is a syndrome that has been well documented in both humans and animals. Human descriptions of pyrethroid paresthesia vary from "tingling" to "pins and needles" to "burning" sensations in the skin at the site of pyrethroid contact. These sensations begin within 30 minutes of application and may last 8 to 24 hours if untreated. Some pets appear to experience similar discomfort following application of spot-on products; the fact that the products are generally applied between the shoulder blades can make the sensation particularly annoying to the pets. Affected pets, cats in particular, may become hyperactive and agitated as they try to walk away from the sensation; others may become quiet, subdued and reluctant to move. Skin at the product application site will appear normal (if redness is noted, you're dealing with contact dermatitis, see below). Fortunately, treating epidermal paresthesia is fairly simple and entails bathing off the product with a mild dish soap (pet shampoos are too mild to remove all of the product). For pyrethroid paresthesia, applying vitamin E to the affected skin can provide quick relief— just use scissors to snip open a vitamin E capsule (the kind used as a vitamin supplement) and squeeze the oily contents onto the pet's skin and rub it in. A rare but more significant skin reaction (in terms of sensitivity) to spot-on products is contact dermatitis, in which an inflammatory reaction develops in response to the topically applied product. These responses - sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity reactions - can occur upon the first use of a product, but more commonly occur after several uneventful exposures to the product. The body sets up an inflammatory response to the site of application, and the skin will appear red and irritated. In more severe cases, wheals or blisters may develop and the skin may actually ulcerate. Unlike paresthesia, which tends to occur within 30 minutes of application, oftentimes the onset of contact dermatitis is delayed for several hours, with the full extent of the injury taking 12 to 24 hours to develop. Depending on the degree of the inflammatory reaction, the level of discomfort can range from mild to quite severe. After bathing off the spot-on product, pets who develop more than mild redness at the application site should be seen by their veterinarians for further treatment to reduce the inflammation and discomfort. The good news is that skin reactions to spot-on flea/tick control products are quite uncommon, and most pets will have no problems when these products are used. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict which individual will react to a given product until the reaction has occurred. For this reason, it is a good idea to observe your pet closely for at least an hour following the application of any spot-on product for any signs of discomfort. Although not life-threatening, skin reactions can range from mildly annoying to very painful; for this reason, a pet that has had a reaction to a spot-on product should never have the same product applied in the future. If a spot-on product is still desired for flea and/or tick control, try a product with different active ingredients than the one that caused the reaction. Following application, watch the pet carefully and be ready to bathe at the first sign of problems. Unfortunately, there are rare individuals that cannot tolerate any of the topical spot-on products, and other flea control options such as sprays or dips may be needed. More serious problems can result when spot-on flea/tick products designed for dogs are inappropriately applied to cats. Certain concentrated pyrethroids (e.g. permethrin) that are not harmful to dogs can cause life-threatening tremors and/or seizures if applied to cats—these are not really adverse events but are instead true poisonings since the product was misused.  Always read the label before using any topical flea/tick product on cats, andneverapply products intended for dogs onto cats. Frontline (fipronil) istoxic to rabbits. If your pet has a reaction to a flea or tick control product of any kind, you should report the reaction. All spot-on product labels will have a phone number that you can use to report the reaction to the manufacturer. By law, the manufacturer is required to send monthly reports of adverse reactions to the appropriate federal regulating authority. Alternatively, you can go to the agencies' websites to find out how to report reactions directly to them. Report reactions to flea/tick products containing heartworm preventatives, such as Revolution and Advantage Multi, to the Food and Drug Administration; report flea/tick products that do not contain heartworm preventatives to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Category: Alopecia X is a Pattern of Baldness
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Alopecia is the medical term for baldness. The term does not specify a particular type, pattern or cause of baldness; it is a general term. There are many types of alopecia/baldness. One particular type of baldness has been described in the Nordic or plush-coated breeds whereby the dog develops coat loss on the main body as well as darkly pigmented skin in the bald areas. The legs and head are generally spared and retain a normal coat. The condition we call "alopecia X," however, is not associated with the hormone imbalances that normally create endocrine alopecia. Its causes remain mysterious hence the name alopecia X. Given that there are numerous therapies that work for some cases and not for others, and that many of these therapies seem to be in complete opposition, it may be that alopecia X is not one disease but several and we simply do not know how to distinguish them. Alopecia X goes by many names: The following is what is currently believed about this confusing condition. The good news is that alopecia X is a cosmetic condition only. There is no downside to the dog except for looking funny. For this reason, treatment with medications is frequently discouraged because drugs can have bodywide effects while the disease itself has none. Furthermore, treatment has been fraught with partial responses and can be frustrating if not expensive, depending on what therapy is selected. The skin biopsy is particularly important in making a diagnosis of alopecia X. If possible, a pathologist who specializes in reading skin tissue should be requested. The biopsy will identify structures typical of alopecia X hair follicles and help rule out concurrent allergy or infection that might mimic alopecia X. The University of Tennessee Hormone Profile One option in the pursuit of effective alopecia X therapy is the adrenal sex hormone panel available at the University of Tennessee. This test is done by drawing a baseline blood panel, administering a pituitary hormone called ACTH, and drawing a second blood sample an hour later to compare. Samples are shipped to Tennessee for evaluation for numerous adrenal sex hormones. The results show not only which hormones respond abnormally but the university will make suggestions as to which therapy might be likely to work. Testing is not inexpensive and results can take several weeks to obtain but may help in selecting what therapy makes sense to try next. Often, results are ambiguous and difficult to interpret. Different specialists have different opinions on the usefulness of information obtained. This blood test may be recommended by your veterinarian as part of the alopecia X work up so we mention it here. The Typical Patient The typical Alopecia X patient is a Spitz or Nordic breed such as an American Eskimo, Chow Chow, Pomeranian, Alaskan Malamute, Elkhound, or similar. Poodles have also been over-represented. Hair loss begins in early adulthood, usually by age three years. First, the long primary hairs go, leaving a fuzzy, puppy-like coat but eventually that goes, too. The bald skin becomes hyperpigmented but is not itchy, and the skin does not usually get infected. Diagnostic Testing Part of the problem is that all hormone-based hair losses can look exactly like this, so some testing is needed to determine which of several conditions are occurring. Expect your veterinarian to begin with: The purpose of this rather broad testing is to rule out diseases that look like alopecia X but for which well-defined treatment protocols exist. This means that two conditions must absolutely be ruled out before proceeding with the trial and error process of alopecia X treatment. Both these hormone imbalances lead to endocrine alopecia and while they look like alopecia X, they have their own specific treatments. Therapy Now that it has been determined that the dog in question has Alopecia X, it would be great if we could wake up the sleeping hair follicles and regrow some hair. It turns out there are several therapies to choose from. The problem is that while some dogs will respond with hair growths to a therapy course, other dogs will not respond at all. Let's see what the choices are: SterilizationAlopecia X seems to be a sex hormone imbalance in at least some cases and didn’t earn the name castration responsive alopecia for nothing. For this reason, the first step in treatment is to sterilize the patient; unspayed females should be spayed, and intact males should be neutered. There are health benefits to sterilization regardless of whether or not there is a hair loss issue, and many animals will grow their hair back (though possibly not permanently) so this is where we start rather than investing in complex and confusing diagnostics. If this does not work or the pet is already sterilized, then we move on to melatonin supplementation. MelatoninMelatonin can be obtained in 3 mg tablets at most health food stores or vitamin retail outlets. Approximately 40 percent of dogs will show some response within six to eight weeks. The medication should be given for at least two or three months before giving up but if hair regrowth occurs, the medication is continued until hair growth seems to have plateaued. After maximal hair regrowth has been achieved, the dose is gradually tapered down to a weekly dose over several months. Some dogs can ultimately discontinue medication though it is important to realize that if you discontinue the medication and the hair falls out again, the condition may not be responsive to melatonin a second time. Recently melatonin implants have become available in the U.S. These are implanted in a similar manner to a microchip and dissolve under the skin over time. These can be used as an alternative to the oral product. Melatonin Side Effects and Issues Since melatonin is a nutritional supplement, rather than a prescription medication, the FDA does not insist on the same quality control it does for drugs. There may be tremendous differences in the amount of melatonin contained in pills between brands. Nature's Bounty® brand has been a preferred brand but any major supplement brand should be acceptable. If neither sterilization nor melatonin have been fruitful and we know the dog does not have Cushing's disease or hypothyroidism, then it is important to realize that the therapies left to try have potential side effects. Consider this: Alopecia X is a cosmetic condition. It may make the dog look funny, but it does not cause harm. You will need to weigh the potential side effects of therapy against your pet's appearance. That said, there are other therapies that can be attempted. Micro-NeedlingAlopecia X is sometimes called biopsy responsive alopecia. After the skin biopsy samples are taken in the diagnostic process described above, some dogs will regrow a small tuft of hair in the biopsy area. The theory is that the inflammation associated with healing has awakened the hair follicles in that local area. This concept is applied more broadly with micro-needling, in which a roller of tiny needles is rolled over the skin creating tiny punctures and putting the skin into a healing mode. This procedure is widely used in human aesthetics to generate collagen, remove wrinkles and brighten skin complexion. The needles can be painful or at least uncomfortable so the patient may require sedation or numbing with topical anesthetics. The skin is somewhat tender for a day or so after the procedure. Different studies report different success rates ranging from 40 to 90 percent. Because some discomfort is afforded the patient and sedation is typically needed, plus alopecia X is of cosmetic concern only, using this treatment is somewhat controversial. Deslorelin ImplantsDeslorelin is a veterinary hormone that curtails the production of estrogen and testosterone and is usually used to time ovulation in mares. It is available as an implant and was recently tested in alopecia X. Within three months, 60 percent of the unneutered male dogs experienced hair regrowth. None of the spayed females experienced hair regrowth. No side effects were noted during the one-year period of testing. This may pan out as a treatment strategy for unneutered male dogs. Medroxyprogesterone AcetateInjections of this long-acting progesterone were used monthly for four months in a group of Pomeranians with alopecia X. Some responded partially, one completely regrew hair, and some did not respond at all. None of the dogs had side effects during the time of the study; however, progestins are famous for inducingmammary tumors, uterine infections, anddiabetes mellitusso their use should be weighed against their potential for problems. TrilostaneCushing's diseaseis a disease of adrenal cortisone excess. The production of cortisone is complex and some of the pathways are common to sex-hormone production. For this reason, therapy for Cushing's disease sometimes works on alopecia X.Trilostaneis a medication used to treat Cushing's disease to suppress steroid hormone production, which includes the sex steroids. Trilostane has the potential to create a dangerous deficiency in adrenal steroids so it is not without risk even though it has been effective in causing hair regrowth in some patients. Alopecia X is a frustrating condition and will remain frustrating for years to come. Research is ongoing and progress comes gradually.

Category: A Overview of Sarcoptic Mange (Scabies) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called Scabies) The Organism and How It Lives Sarcoptic mange is the name for the skin disease caused by infection with theSarcoptes scabieimite. Mites are not insects; instead, they are more closely related to spiders. They are microscopic and cannot be seen with the naked eye. AdultSarcoptes scabieimites live three to four weeks in the host’s skin. After mating, the female burrows into the skin, depositing three to four eggs in the tunnel behind her. The eggs hatch in three to 10 days, producing larvae which, in turn, move about on the skin surface, eventually molting into their nymphal stage and finally into adults. The adults move on the skin surface where they mate, and the cycle begins again with the female burrowing and laying eggs. Appearance The motion of the mite in and on the skin is extremely itchy. Furthermore, burrowed mites and their eggs generate a massive allergic response in the skin that is even itchier. Mites prefer hairless skin, and thus, the ear flaps, elbows, and abdomen are at the highest risk for the red, scaly, itchy skin that characterizes sarcoptic mange. This pattern of itching is similar to that found withenvironmental allergies(atopy) as well as withfood allergies. Frequently, before attempting to sort out allergies, a veterinarian will simply treat a patient for sarcoptic mange as a precaution or change to a flea product that will cover sarcoptic mange mites. This is an easy way to be sure sarcoptic mange is crossed off the list of possible skin disease causes. It is easy to be led down the wrong path and pursue allergies aggressively if sarcoptic mange is considered too unusual or unlikely. As the infection progresses, eventually, most of the dog's body will be involved. Classically, though, the picture begins on the ears (especially the ear margins), elbows, and abdomen. The term scabies refers to mite infestations by eitherSarcoptes scabieior other closely related mite species. WhileSarcoptes scabieican infect humans and cats, it tends not to persist on these hosts. When people - including some veterinarians - refer to sarcoptic mange or scabies in a cat, they are usually referring to infection byNotoedres cati, a mite closely related toSarcoptes scabiei. In these feline cases, it is more correct to refer tonotoedric mange, though the treatment for both mites is largely the same. Scabies vs. Sarcoptic Mange: Are They The Same Thing? The term "scabies" refers to mite infections caused bySarcoptes scabieimites or other mites closely related to them (infections caused by theSarcoptiformmite family). For dogs, this is usuallySarcoptes scabiei.For cats, this is usuallyNotoedres cati, but could beSarcoptes scabiei. In humans, "scabies" usually refers to infection withSarcoptes scabiei hominis, a mite that infects only people, although the canine mite discussed here (Sarcoptes scabiei)can most certainly infect people. How The Infection is Spread While mites can live off of a host for days to weeks depending on their life stage, they are only infective in the environment for 36 hours, which means that decontamination of the environment is generally not necessary. Spraying, deep cleaning, etc., is not necessary, although machine washing bedding is advised. Different varieties of Sarcoptes scabei mites infest their specific mammals. Sarcoptes scabiei var. canis mites infest dogs, while Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis infests humans. Although the mites can transfer from one species to another, the infections are typically self-limiting (i.e. they go away on their own). The mites cannot complete their life cycles (they cannot reproduce and live continually) on the "wrong" hosts. As previously discussed, when dogs are infected with Sarcoptes scabiei, those mites can transfer to people. The mites burrow into human skin, causing significant itchiness and irritation which sometimes leads to secondary skin infections (from humans scratching themselves and introducing bacteria into the skin). The mites are most active where the skin is warm, such as in bed, or where clothing is snug. Human infestations caused by dog-specific mites usually go away on their own within 12-14 days. Always see your physician if you have concerns about your skin while your pet is experiencing a skin condition. If a pet affected by sarcoptic mange is in the home, it is a good idea to wash any bedding in the washing machine (or replace it with new bedding) and wash any collars or harnesses.  Diagnosis Skin ScrapingClassically, mite infection is diagnosed by scraping the skin surface with a scalpel blade and examining the skin debris under a microscope for mites. If the mite’s presence is confirmed by skin scraping, then you know immediately the cause of the itching; you need not be concerned about allergy possibilities or other diseases, and the condition can be addressed with confidence. When an animal with sarcoptic mange scratches himself, he breaks open the tunnels that the mites have burrowed into, and the mites are killed, although the itch persists due to toxins in the skin. The result is that the mites can be difficult to confirm by skin scraping tests. (Probably mites are confirmed in 50 percent or fewer of sarcoptic mange cases.) Medication TrialSince negative test results do not rule out mite infection, a "maybe mange" test is frequently performed. This consists simply of treating for sarcoptic mange and observing for resolution of the signs within two to four weeks. Treatment is simple and highly successful in most cases, so it is fairly easy to rule out sarcoptic mange with a trial course of medication. See below for treatment options. BiopsyMange mites are rarely seen on a skin biopsy sample, although if the sample is read by a pathologist who specializes in reading skin samples, the type of inflammation seen in the sample can be highly suggestive of sarcoptic mange. As a general rule, if the skin is biopsied, it is a good idea for the veterinarian to request that a dermatohistopathologist read the sample. Treatment While sarcoptic mange is difficult to diagnose definitively, it is fairly easy to treat, and a number of choices are available. Remember, all dogs in a household where sarcoptic mange has been diagnosed should be treated. At this point in time, many common flea products will get rid of a scabies infection handily. Using one of them will not only treat the scabies but will prevent future episodes as well. Some of these common products can be used the way they are normally used to prevent fleas, while others need an "off-label" dosing schedule that could be an issue for dogs with the MDR1 mutation. Some individuals have a mutation of the MDR1 gene that interferes with the dog's ability to metabolize many drugs, including those related toivermectin, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic. This is not an issue at label doses but can be really toxic at the doses used to kill mites. These individuals are usually of the Collie family: Collies, Shetland Sheepdogs, and Australian Shepherds are classically affected. There is now a DNA test that can determine if any dog has the mutation.  If there is any question, a medication that does not require an off-label dose adjustment should be used for mange treatment. The IsoxazolinesOral flea products that cover both fleas and ticks are popular and includeNexgard®, Simparica®, Bravecto®, and Credelio®. Any of these will readily kill sarcoptic mange mites in one dose just as readily as they handle fleas and ticks. The MDR1 mutation does not come into play. Selamectin(Selarid® or Revolution®)Selamectin is an ivermectin derivative for dogs to control fleas, ticks,heartworm,ear mites, andsarcoptic mange mites. Normal monthly use of this product should prevent a sarcoptic mange problem, but to clear an actual infection, an extra dose is usually needed after 2 weeks for reliable results. This extra dose could possibly be an issue for dogs with the MDR1 mutation. Moxidectin(Advantage Multi)– Moxidectin is yet another ivermectin derivative. In Advantage Multi, it is combined with imidacloprid, a flea-killing topical, to create a product used againstheartworm,hookworm,roundworm,whipworm, andfleas. In the U.S., this product is now FDA labeled for sarcoptic mange and is also a good choice where there is concern about the MDR1 gene mutation as one regular dose should handle the mange mites. Milbemycin Oxime(Interceptor®, Sentinel®, or Trifexis®)Milbemycin oxime is approved for heartworm prevention as a monthly oral treatment and is available combined with oral flea products as well. Happily, it also has activity against sarcoptic mange, and several protocols have been recommended. There could be issues with the MDR1 mutation, depending on the protocol. IvermectinThis is one of the most effective treatments againstSarcoptes scabeiyet is off-label as far as the FDA is concerned. There are several protocols due to its long activity in the body. Typically, an injection is given either weekly or every two weeks in 1-4 doses. Because there are so many safer and more convenient derivatives at this point, we mostly mention it for its historical significance because, before its development, mange treatment was labor intensive with repeated dipping and bathing. Ivermectin opened the door for a simple treatment for this condition. DippingHere, a mite-killing dip is applied, usually following a therapeutic shampoo. Weekly mitaban dips (Amitraz), or lime-sulfur dips are usually effective. The disease typically resolves within one month. Dipping is troublesome, messy, and rarely done anymore as the other products are easier and more rapidly effective. We only mention it since it had been a standard mange treatment for decades prior to ivermectin. In the Meantime During the time it takes to control the mite infection, the pet will be very itchy. Controlling secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics is important. Also, since the body's reaction to the mite is one of hypersensitivity (essentially an allergic reaction), a cortisone derivative is worthwhile to quell the itchiest symptoms. Ask your veterinarian about which prescriptions are appropriate for your pet. As for anti-itch shampoos, rinses, and other forms of itch relief, seeitch-relievingideas for additional suggestions.

Category: Anal Sac Tumors in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   If your dog has ever scooted their rear end across your carpet, they were probably trying toempty their anal sacs. Humans don’t have anal sacs that are similar to our pets, but dogs and cats, along with many other animals do.  A few pets may develop issues with these sacs, so, what are they? Anal sacs, also called anal glands, are small balloon-like structures filled with a brown liquid known for its repulsively metallic, fishy smell. Dogs have two anal glands that sit just inside their anus at the 4 and 8 o’clock positions. When the dog defecates, some of the stinky fluid in these sacs is squeezed out with the feces. This liquid may play a role in territorial marking and communication among dogs. What Are Anal Sac Tumors? Many problems can affect a dog’s anal sacs, including tumors. Some cancerous anal sac tumors, known as anal sac adenocarcinomas or apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinomas are abnormal, malignant growths of the anal sac. They are uncommon but serious and can affect any dog but older dogs. Certain breeds such as Spaniels, German Shepherds, and dachshunds are at higher risk. There are also benign forms of anal sac tumors (not malignant) called perianal gland adenomas. Overall, anal sac tumors can bring illness, discomfort, and a decreased quality of life to your dog. Thus, it is essential to catch these tumors early, determine what type of tumor they are, and treat them as soon as possible. What Causes Anal Sac Tumors? As with most cancers, a cause has not been identified. However, genetics and environmental factors likely play important roles. Although we can’t pinpoint a cause, we do have some understanding of what’s happening at a microscopic level. Cells in the anal sac start dividing and multiplying in an uncontrolled manner. This cell division creates a mass that makes the anal sac larger, but this alone usually doesn’t cause issues, at least until the mass gets quite large. The larger concern (with adenocarcinomas) is when cancer cells break away and travel to other parts of the body to make new tumors.  These malignant cells often spread to lymph nodes, which are small lumps of immune tissue scattered throughout the body. They can also spread to essential organs, such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Another problem with anal sac tumors is that they sometimes increase the amount of calcium in the blood.High calcium levelscan damage the kidneys, which are the organs that filter blood and make urine. High calcium levels can also disrupt the function of the nervous system, intestines, and heart. As you might imagine, this disruption can cause a range of symptoms and issues for your dog. What Are The Signs of Anal Sac Tumors? It depends on the behavior of the tumor and if and to where it has spread. Many dogs won’t show any signs. However, when the tumor spreads to nearby lymph nodes or the mass gets large, your dog may strain and struggle to defecate or not even defecate at all. They can also have ribbon-like stools and some swelling in the back legs. If the tumor increases blood calcium levels, your dog may drink and pee more, eat less, vomit, and seem weak and tired. Other possible signs include: Dogs with anal sac tumors may also scoot, meaning they sit and drag their rear end against the ground. However, scooting much more commonly indicates full or inflamed anal glands that need to be expressed (squeezed) by your veterinarian, rather than cancer. How Are Anal Sac Tumors Diagnosed? Your veterinarian will talk to you about the history of your dog’s problem as well as perform a physical exam. As part of this, they may conduct a rectal exam to feel for the tumor. During this procedure, they will stick a gloved finger through your dog’s anus into the rectum. If they feel or see a growth, they might do a fine needle aspiration of the mass. This means they will poke the mass with a needle, suck out some of the cells, put them on a glass slide, and send it to a lab for evaluation. This information will help narrow down what the mass is. If these results are suspicious of cancer, your veterinarian will likely surgically remove the mass and send it to a lab to confirm it is cancer. Your veterinarian will also do additional tests to see if and where the tumor has spread and if it has affected the body in other ways. For example, your veterinarian may do blood and urine tests, to check for high blood calcium and kidney damage, as well as chest X-rays and abdominal ultrasound to see if the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes and organs, such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys. How Are Anal Sac Tumors Treated? Until more serious treatment can be pursued, your veterinarian may recommend stool softeners to make it easier for your dog to defecate and give fluids and medications. They may also refer you to a veterinary surgeon more well-versed in treating these serious tumors. Surgery If it is possible, surgical removal of the mass and any enlarged lymph nodes in the area is the main way to treat anal gland adenocarcinomas (malignant). Surgery has been shown to lengthen the survival time of dogs with anal sac adenocarcinomas. However, tumors may eventually reappear if cancer cells are left behind and the cancer cells may have already spread to other sites at the time of removal. With perianal gland adenomas (benign), surgery usually cures the disease, but regrowth can occur in some dogs over time. After surgery, some dogs won’t be able to control their bowel movements for a while and there is an infection risk at the surgical site, especially if it is near the route feces take out of the body. Chemotherapy and Radiation - Malignant Tumors Because malignant anal sac tumors have such a high risk of spread, chemotherapy is often recommended after surgery. It involves giving medications, often via the mouth or blood, to kill or inhibit cancer cells throughout the body. Radiation therapy may also be recommended after or instead of surgery if surgery isn’t possible. It involves using radiation to destroy cancer cells. It is only offered at certain facilities, such as veterinary schools and some specialty practices, due to the expense of the equipment. Some people travel significant distances to get radiation services. Both chemotherapy and radiation therapy can have serious side effects that your veterinarian will discuss with you. What is the Prognosis (Outlook) for Malignant Anal Sac Tumors? Survival times for dogs with anal sac tumors are variable but on average range from about 1-2 years. However, every dog’s situation is different because the prognosis depends on many factors such as: Dogs who receive surgery or any type of treatment generally have a better prognosis whereas the outlook is often less promising for dogs with larger tumors, high blood calcium levels, and extensive spread of the tumor. How Can I Prevent Anal Sac Tumors? There’s no proven way to prevent anal sac tumors from developing. Early detection is important and may be achieved through routine rectal exams performed by your veterinarian. Sometimes anal sac tumors are an incidental finding during a seemingly healthy pet’s physical exam. Maintaining a regular exam schedule as recommended by your veterinarian can help screen for anal sac and other abnormalities, hopefully keeping your dog as healthy and happy as possible.

Category: Benign Sebaceous Gland Tumors
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We receive a fair amount of emails related to thePapilloma articlefrom people with older dogs with numerous "warts" wondering if their dog's warts will go away as viral warts usually do. The problem is that in older dogs, what looks like a viral wart is probably a sebaceous gland tumor, while there is a very good chance it is benign, it will not be going away any time soon. It is not uncommon for an elderly dog to develop scores of "warts" which are not warts at all but are sebaceous growths. Most sebaceous growths are benign but one cannot say for sure simply by looking. Here are some reasons to remove a sebaceous growth:  These growths are typically small (pea size or smaller) and originate from the skin's sebaceous glands, the oil-producing glands of the skin. Because these growths are small, they are generally amenable to removal with local anesthetic. This is helpful since often patients are older and not good anesthesia candidates. It is usually not practical to remove a large number of sebaceous growths with local anesthesia at the same time but the most troublesome can be selected for removal. Viral warts are different and occur primarily on the face of young adult and adolescent dogs. Sebaceous gland tumors occur in any location, often in large numbers, and usually in older dogs (and occasionally in older cats). There are several types of sebaceous gland tumors: Nodular Sebaceous Hyperplasia About 50% of sebaceous growths are technically not tumors at all and are classified as excessive growth of the gland tissue. It is thought that growths of this group ultimately develop into actual benign sebaceous adenomas as described below. These lesions are round, cauliflower-like, and sometimes secrete material that forms a crust. Occasionally they even bleed. They are particularly common in Cocker spaniels, Beagles, Miniature Schnauzers, Poodles, and Dachshunds. This growth is technically not a tumor but is actually an area of excessive sebaceous cell division. Sebaceous Epithelioma Another 37% of sebaceous growths fit into this category. These look just the same as sebaceous hyperplasias to the naked eye but tend to occur in larger breeds and usually on the eyelids or head. They often pigment into a black color. They were formerly described as benign but it turns out they are able to spread in a malignant fashion if given enough time. Since it is not possible to distinguish a low-grade malignant epithelioma from hyperplasia, it is smart to remove any sebaceous growth and not take a chance. Sebaceous Adenoma These lesions also look the same as the others to the naked eye. These are also actual benign tumors that probably arose from areas of hyperplasia. As previously mentioned, if given enough time a sebaceous hyperplasia growth will develop into an adenoma. Both are benign. Sebaceous Carcinoma About 2% of sebaceous tumors are malignant and may be locally invasive but even malignant sebaceous tumors rarely spread. They have a greater tendency towards ulceration than benign growths. Cocker spaniels seem to be predisposed. Again, in most cases, the removal of sebaceous gland tumors is straightforward and can frequently be done with a simple local anesthetic. In the event that further treatment is needed, your veterinarian will make recommendations or possibly refer you to a veterinary dermatologist.

Category: Black Fly Bites on Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Black flies (buffalo gnats) are members of theSimullidaefamily. Their colors vary from black to gray to yellow to olive, and their thorax is humped over the head, giving the appearance of a bison’s hump. The female flies require a blood meal to lay eggs. Males are never blood-feeders; they feed on nectar from flowers. Black fly larvae (young) are carnivorous. There are more than 1,000 species of black flies, but only a few are considered important pests. Black flies feed on all types of animals, including dogs, cats, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, wildlife, birds, and humans. Black flies are distributed throughout the world. The eggs are laid in fast-running water on stones or leaves just below the water. Larvae are nearly always found in swiftly flowing, well-aerated water. Some species breed in larger rivers; others live in temporary or semipermanent streams. Black flies are particularly abundant in the north temperate and subarctic zones. Adult black flies may fly 8–11 miles (12–18 km) from swiftly flowing streams; migrating windborne swarms have been known to travel more than 155 miles (250 km). Black flies are active during the morning and evening hours, and during hot days, black flies rest near the ground on the underside of leaves. Female black flies inflict painful bites, and animals' ears, neck, head, and abdomen are favorite feeding sites. Local reactions such as redness, itching, and wheals (a raised, itchy spot) at the bite site are common. There can be severe effects in sensitive animals or if the animal has a large number of bites. Swarms of black flies have caused cattle to stampede and refuse to graze, and there have been cases of death in production animals. The bites may result in petechial hemorrhage (reddish spots indicating bleeding under the skin) and lesions can take weeks to heal, especially on the teats of cows and goats. Reduced milk, meat, and egg production may result from less extensive attacks. Poultry can become anemic from a black fly attack. Death from a severe attack can result from a toxin in the fly's saliva, which increases capillary permeability, meaning small blood vessels are compromised, permitting the fluid from the circulatory system to ooze into the body cavity and tissue spaces. Some species of black flies can transmit diseases. Bite Prevention and Treatment Control of black flies requires destroying breeding sites, moving animals away from the insects’ breeding grounds, and treating animals with insecticides and repellents. Black fly control is difficult because of the large number of flowing water breeding sites. Streams can be treated by using a microbial larvicide,Bacillus thuringiensisisraelensis, a product safe for mammals. Adult black flies are small enough to pass through window screens or come indoors on or within a pet’s hair coat. The adult female flies prefer to feed outdoors and during the daylight hours. Pet owners concerned about black fly bites may use over-the-counter insect repellents. Aerosols containing pyrethrins may provide only temporary relief. Because area-wide control of black flies is difficult and expensive, people frequently use repellents daily to protect their pets and other animals. Treatment is often unnecessary. The skin reaction usually goes away in 24 – 48 hours. But if your pet is very uncomfortable or having a more extensive reaction from the bites, your veterinarian may suggest antihistamines, steroids, anti-inflammatories, etc. The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Coat Clipping: Other Options to Keep your Dog Cool
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When temperatures rise, it can be a challenge to keep pets cool while still being able to enjoy the outdoors with our four-legged friends. One response is to shave dogs, but here are some factors to consider before reaching for the clippers. Does coat clipping help dogs keep cool? Dogs have different skin and hair than people.While wearing a sweater during summer might sound uncomfortable to us, in some breeds a thick and wooly hair coat actually prevents dogs from overheating by acting as a layer of cooling insulation. Dogs also don’t have sweat glands all over their body (just on their paws), so shaving won’t help your dog release more heat through sweating. Additionally, many other factors besides hair coat affect how well dogs cope with heat. Dogs that are overweight (obese) can overheat easily. Because panting is an important way for your dog to cool off, dogs with short snouts (brachycephalic) can be more heat intolerant than other dogs. What are the drawbacks of coat clipping? Many dogs have their coats clipped without any problems. However, consider the following before clipping your dog’s hair coat: If you decide to clip your dog’s hair coat, consider taking your dog to a professional groomer or your veterinarian to make sure the hair is cut properly. What else can I do besides clipping my dog’s hair coat to help them with the heat? Grooming your pet on a regular basis helps remove excess undercoat. Grooming will prevent and remove hair mats, which decrease air circulation around hairs. You can also help your pets cope with heat by providing shade and clean water while outdoors. During the summer months, avoid overexerting your dog and schedule runs and other activities to when the temperatures are cooler.

Category: Demodectic Mange in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Sometimes called red mange or demodicosis) Read aboutdemodectic mange in cats. The Culprit -Demodex Canis Demodectic mange, also called demodicosis, is caused by one of the microscopic mites of theDemodexgenus. Three species ofDemodexmites have been identified in dogs:Demodex canis, Demodex cornei,andDemodex injai. The most common mite of demodectic mange isDemodex canis. All dogs raised normally by their mothers possess this mite as mites are transferred from mother to pup via cuddling during the first few days of life. Most dogs live in harmony with their mites, never suffering any consequences from being parasitized. If, however, conditions change to upset the natural equilibrium (such as some kind of suppression of the dog's immune system), theDemodexmites may gain the upper hand. The mites proliferate and can cause serious skin diseases. Is Demodicosis Contagious? Unlikesarcoptic mange, demodectic mange is not considered a contagious disease, and isolation of affected dogs is generally not considered necessary. That said, there are some circumstances under which the mites could spread from one dog to another. ClassicallyDemodexmites have been felt to only be transferable from mother to newborn pup. After the pup is a week or so old, it has developed enough immunity so that infection is no longer possible. In other words, after age one week or so, a dog will no longer accept new mites on its body. Recently this idea has been challenged as occasionally multiple unrelated dogs break with demodicosis in the same household. It is not clear if some species ofDemodexare more contagious than others or if some contagion is possible under certain circumstances. Current thinking is that mites actually can be transferred from one dog to another but as long as the dog is healthy, the mites simply add into the dog's natural mite population, and no skin disease results. In rare circumstances, the spread of disease is possible if severe infection is involved. While there are still assorted theories about dog-to-dog transmission ofDemodexmites, there is no question that mites cannot be transmitted to humans or to cats. Demodicosis Has Three Forms Form #1: Localized Localized demodicosis occurs as isolated, scaly bald patches, usually on the dog's face, creating a polka-dot appearance. Localized demodicosis is considered a common puppyhood ailment, and approximately 90% of cases resolve with no treatment of any kind. This is quite a contrast to generalized demodicosis, as described below, so it is important to be able to distinguish localized from generalized disease. It seems like this would be a simple task since localized demodicosis classically involves several round facial bald spots, and generalized demodicosis involves a bald scaly entire dog; still, reality does not always fit into neat categories in this way. Some guidelines used to distinguish localized demodicosis include: Treatment is not necessary nor recommended for localized demodicosis but there are so many regular flea products that killDemodexmites that most puppies will clear simply by starting their normal prescription flea control regimen. Not all flea products will killDemodex; one needs a product of the isoxazoline class, and the puppy must be old enough for such a product. If there is a reason why the puppy cannot take an isoxazoline flea product, there are alternatives. Goodwinol ointment, an insecticide ointment, may be used daily to control localized demodicosis. Antibacterial gels are also used against localized demodicosis and associated skin infections. It is important to note that rubbing a creme or ointment on a demodicosis lesion can cause reddening of the lesion, making it appear to get worse. It is also possible for rubbing the medication on the area to break off the weaker hairs at the margin of the lesion, causing the lesion to appear to get bigger. Neither of these situations truly represents an exacerbation of the disease. Without treatment, the resolution of a localized demodicosis lesion should be at least partially apparent after one month though total resolution can take up to three months. Approximately 10% of localized demodicosis cases will progress to generalized demodicosis. Enlarged lymph nodes are a bad sign -- often foretelling generalized mange. Can the Pup be Bred Later? Sometimes the puppy with localized demodicosis was obtained for breeding purposes. The current recommendation is not to treat these puppies so that we can determine if the condition will stay localized and resolve or if it will generalize. If it stays localized and eventually resolves without treatment, the animal is still a candidate for breeding. If the condition generalizes to cover the entire body, the animal should be sterilized. If the condition receives treatment and resolves, we will never know how the disease would have gone in its natural state and will not know whether the pup is carrying the genetic predisposition for generalized demodectic mange. In this case, it is best to be conservative and not take the chance of passing on genetic predisposition for this disease. Localized demodicosis is almost exclusively a puppyhood disease. When a puppy develops localized demodicosis the chance of the condition resolving is 90% unless there is a family history of demodicosis in related dogs. In this case, the chance of spontaneous resolution drops to 50%. Occasionally an adult dog develops localized demodicosis. We currently do not have a good understanding of the prognosis or significance of this condition in an adult dog. It is important that dogs with a history of generalized demodectic mange not be bred, as there is a hereditary component to the disease. Form #2: Generalized Generalized demodicosis entails much more extensive involvement of the skin. Large patches of skin are affected and, if allowed to progress untreated, the entire surface of the dog may be impacted. Sometimes a polka dot appearance results but if there are more than four spots present, the patient is no longer classified as having the "localized" form, and treatment rules for generalized disease may be applied. The secondary bacterial infections make this a very itchy and often smelly skin disease. These infections may require antibiotics but it is important to realize that infection will probably not resolve fully until the mites are gone. The goal of treatment is the total eradication of the mite population on the dog's body. Juvenile Onset (The Most Common Form) Young dogs that develop demodicosis are believed to have a genetic immunological defect that allows the mite to gain the upper hand. As the puppy grows up and his or her immune system matures, the immune system tends to naturally regain control of their mite infestation; in fact, 30-50% of dogs under age 1 year recover spontaneously from generalized demodicosis without any form of treatment. Usually, treatment is recommended, though, to facilitate recovery. Adult Onset Most demodicosis occurs in young dogs under age one and a half. An older dog should not get demodicosis unless there is an underlying problem with the immune system. In such cases, demodicosis is considered an indication to seek a more serious hidden condition such as cancer, liver or kidney disease, or an immune-suppressive hormone imbalance. A more extensive medical work-up will be required. In the case of shelter dogs, sometimes the stress of abandonment, street living, starvation or other poor husbandry can compound into the immune suppression needed to generate a case of adult-onset demodectic mange. Years ago, generalized demodicosis was nearly untreatable, and many dogs were euthanized for uncontrollable disease. Today, treatment for most dogs is surprisingly simple. Treatment The biggest change in treating this condition came, as mentioned, with the release of the isoxazoline flea products (sarolaner/Simparica®, fluralaner/Bravecto®, afoxalaner/Nexgard®, lotilaner/Credelio®). The isoxazoline products are oral medications labeled to kill fleas and ticks in dogs. It turns out they have substantial activity againstDemodexmites and are successful enough that they have become the treatment of choice. These products are typically given orally every two to four weeks, depending on the protocol. Most dogs are simply cured by this protocol. Occasionally, a dog fails this treatment and is relegated to the more traditional methods such as high-dose oral ivermectin, a protocol that is not safe for many herding breeds; topical moxidectin (Advantage multi®); daily oral milbemycin (Interceptor®); or even labor-intensive dipping with amitraz (Mitaban®). The common anti-itch medicationoclacitinib (Apoquel®)is an immunosuppressant and thus decreases the body's ability to fight theDemodexinfection. Understand before you use it to treat the itch of theDemodexinfection that it can make the mites worse. Other forms of itch relief should be sought if necessary. Oclatacinib use can actually lead to a recurrence of demodicosis years after recovery, so it should not be used in any dog that has ever suffered from demodicosis previously. Prognosis The younger the dog, the better the chance of cure. Most dogs under one-and-a-half years of age recover completely from generalized demodicosis. In many cases of adult-onset demodicosis, the disease is controlled with treatment, but a cure is not always possible. Some cases can never be controlled. No matter which option you choose, treatment should be accompanied by skin scrapes every two to four weeks. In this way, the effectiveness of treatment is assessed, and dosing can be changed. There are several protocols describing how to determine if treatment can be stopped. The idea is to eradicate every single mite from the dog's body so that the condition cannot recur. This typically entails either continuing treatment for a significant time after the patient appears recovered and/or rechecking skin scrapes a significant time after treatment is finished. Relapse? When relapse occurs, it is often because the dog appeared to be normal, and treatment was discontinued before allDemodexmites were killed off. Relapse is always a possibility with generalized demodicosis as there is no easy way to confirm that every mite has been killed, but most dogs that relapse do so within a six to 12-month period from the time they appear to have been cured. Sarcoptic mangeis a completely different disease. We Wish it Weren't Necessary to Add This Decades ago, dipping dogs with demodectic mange in motor oil was a popular home remedy. However, skin exposure to motor oil can cause rashes and skin destruction in severe cases. The hydrocarbons can be absorbed through the skin and cause a dangerous drop in blood pressure. If motor oil is licked off the coat, resultant vomiting can lead to aspiration of motor oil into the lungs and pneumonia. Kidney and liver damage can result from motor oil dipping. Form #3: Demodectic Pododermatitis   This condition represents demodectic mange confined to the paws. Bacterial infections usually accompany this condition. Often as generalized demodicosis is treated, the foot is the last stronghold of the mite. Old English Sheepdogs and Shar-pei tend to get severe forms of this condition. The infection can be so deep that a biopsy is needed to find the mites and make the diagnosis. It is one of the most resistant forms of demodicosis, and deep infections and proliferative tissue that result can take months and great expense to resolve. In the past, special organophosphate foot soaks, along with daily medications, were needed to resolve this condition, and months of treatment were common. As with the other forms of demodicosis, the isoxazoline flea products (sarolaner/Simparica®, fluralaner/Bravecto®, afoxalaner/Nexgard®, lotilaner/Credelio®) have changed everything. In most cases, the mites can be quickly killed, and the deep secondary infections can be resolved in a matter of weeks (instead of months) once the mites are gone.

Category: Demodicosis (Red Mange) is Caused by Mites on Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Demodicosis (red mange, demodectic mange) is a skin disease caused by a small mite not visible to the naked eye. This mite lives down in the root of the hair. All normal dogs have a small population of Demodex mites, but some dogs develop an overgrowth of these mites. In some cases, the tendency to develop demodectic mange runs in families. Signs of demodicosis can include hair loss, reddened skin, scabbing, crusting and sometimes itching.Localized demodicosisinvolves only small areas of skin on a dog.Generalized demodicosisinvolves most of a dog’s body or paws. Skin infections from mite damage are common. Sometimes, these skin infections become life-threatening, and cause swelling and fever. Many other skin conditions look just like demodicosis and skin tests need to be performed for diagnosis. In a skin scraping, a scalpel blade is used to gently but firmly scrape the skin layers to collect cells and mites. Samples from deep skin scrapings or hair plucks are examined under the microscope for the Demodex mite. Dogs with generalized disease also require further testing for underlying health problems. Any skin infection needs to be treated with a topical medication or antibiotic. For localized demodicosis, most dogs resolve on their own and don’t need to be treated with an anti-mite medication. Instead, dogs with localized demodicosis are observed for spreading or worsening of mites. For dogs with generalized demodicosis, treatment requires an anti-mite medication such as one of the following below. Continue any anti-mite treatment until no mites are found on two consecutive skin scrapings. AmitrazAmitraz is available as a dip (Mitaban®). The Mitaban® is packaged in individual dosing vials of concentrate and diluted in water just prior to application. Side effects are more common in small dogs and can include the following: lethargy, decrease in body temperature, loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. Dips are usually applied either weekly or every two weeks according to the veterinarian's prescription. Dips are usually applied by grooming technicians in the veterinarian's hospital. Occasionally, another form of amitraz (Taktic®) is chosen. Different dilution instructions are required for Taktic®. IvermectinIvermectinis available as a liquid deworming agent (Ivomec® and generics) and as a monthly heartworm preventative pill. For canine demodicosis, the liquid form is given by mouth once a day. Side effects can include the following: lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and neurologic signs. Many veterinarians will gradually increase the dose of ivermectin to monitor for side effects. Side effects are more common in herding breed dogs (e.g. Collies, Border collies, and Old English sheepdogs). A genetic test is also available to determine if a dog may be sensitive to ivermectin. Milbemycin oximeMilbemycin is available as a monthly heartworm preventive pill (Interceptor®) for dogs. For canine demodicosis, the pill is given by mouth once a day.  Side effects can include the following: lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and neurologic signs. MoxidectinMoxidectin is available as a liquid deworming agent and as a monthly topical heartworm preventative (Advantage Multi®). For canine demodicosis, usually the topical form is applied to the skin once a week.  Side effects can include the following: lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and neurologic signs. The Isoxazoline Flea/Tick Products (Bravecto®, Nexgard®, and Simparica®)These medications are available as oral flea and tick control pills for dogs. For canine demodicosis, the dose varies based on the specific product. Many veterinarians will neuter dogs with generalized demodicosis as soon as the disease is under control. This is in the best interest of the dog since breeding and heat cycles can cause disease recurrence. Additionally, veterinarians recommend neutering dogs with juvenile-onset, generalized demodicosis because this disease likely has a genetic basis. Animals with localized demodicosis have a good prognosis with proper care. As the severity of the disease increases, the prognosis worsens. Some dogs with generalized demodicosis must have regular treatment for the rest of their lives while others may be cured after a variable number of months of treatment. In all cases it is important to keep your pet as healthy and stress free as possible, including a good nutritional diet, regular checkups, routine deworming and heartworm prevention.

Category: Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called DLE, Nasal Solar Dermatitis, or Collie Nose) Lupus – What is this Disease? Lupus is an immune-mediated disease stemming from your own immune system reacting against your own DNA. This in itself sounds like a recipe for disaster since almost every cell in a body has DNA in it, but it is important to remember that under normal circumstances your DNA is sequestered in a cell nucleus where the antibodies of the immune system cannot reach it. The immune system in lupus is not going around attacking every cell in the body to get to its DNA; instead, the immune system only sees DNA after cells have died and their assorted broken parts are floating around as debris. The immune system reacts to this loose DNA and generates antibodies. These antibody:DNA complexes deposit in delicate membranes, such as the kidney filtration membranes, blood vessel linings, joint capsules, and other similar structures. Once caught in these membranes, other immunologic cells are attracted and further inflammatory damage results. Systemic lupus (SLE)involves this kind of inflammatory disruption (called a Type III hypersensitivity reaction) and the prognosis depends on which organ systems are affected and how severe the damage is. The disease is not curable but is manageable with immuno-suppressive drugs. The name “lupus” stems from archaic times when the disease was thought to have been caused by the bite of a wolf. Systemic Lupus Versus Discoid Lupus When people use the term lupus, they are referring to systemic lupus, or SLE as described above. Discoid lupus is a form of lupus that is confined to the skin and is substantially more benign because of this confinement. Discoid lupus, or DLE, is almost exclusively a canine disease and is almost always limited to the leather of the nose, called the nasal planum. Features of Discoid Lupus (DLE) The immune-system in lupus is not going around attacking every cell in the body to get to its DNA; instead, the immune system only sees DNA after cells have died and their assorted broken parts are floating around as debris. DLE does not progress to SLE. Lesions of DLE are almost always limited to the nose though they can extend up the bridge of the nose and sometimes affect the ears or inside the mouth. Early signs of the condition start with loss of nose pigment. A black nose will become bluish-grey or even pink. Scaling and cracking of the skin results and eventually, the nose will ulcerate. Exposure to sunshine makes the condition worse and there seems to be a genetic predisposition among the collie breeds (hence the term collie nose). There are several other conditions that also cause crusts and/or erosions on the nose, so it is important to get the right diagnosis. Some other conditions to rule out include: Diagnosis is by biopsy, which means a small piece of nose tissue must be harvested and sent to the laboratory for analysis. Most dogs will not hold still for this kind of procedure on their nose so sedation is generally needed to get proper samples. Expect stitches afterward; some mild bleeding is possible. Diagnosis also involves some important historical information such as whether other body areas are involved, whether the condition is constant or comes and goes, and what medications have helped in the past. The pathologist will consider all of this information along with the microscopic appearance of the tissue.  Therapy Choices Discoid lupus is a condition with many treatment options depending on the severity of symptoms. Avoid Strong SunlightSince this condition is made worse by the sun, it is important to avoid intense sunlight. Sunscreens have been advocated but it is important to realize that there are toxic ingredients in many human sunscreens and anything you apply to a dog’s nose will be licked off. Pet sunscreens are expected to be licked. For an FDA pet-approved sun protectorendorsedby the Food and Drug Administration and endorsed by the American Animal Hospital Association and the SPCA, visit:https://epi-pet.com/ Other sun-shielding products of interest include nose shields and UV light filtering sun visors:http://www.dognoseprotectors.com/ https://protectivepetsolutions.com/collections/dog-line/products/optivizor-long-snout-clear-uv-tint Topical CorticosteroidsThe immune-suppressive effects of steroids are helpful in DLE but the systemic side effects are undesirable. Side effects are minimized by using topical steroids, typically starting twice a day and eventually dropping to an as-needed basis for maintenance after the nose is healed. Tetracycline/NiacinamideTetracycline is an antibiotic with immunomodulating properties separate from its antibiotic properties. Niacinamide (also called nicotinamide) is a B vitamin supplement related to niacin (vitamin B3). The combination of these two medications has been found effective in 70% of dogs with DLE though it can take up to two months to see an effect. Treatment is given three times daily, which is relatively inconvenient for most people so alternatives have been sought.Doxycyclinecan be used twice a day and is frequently substituted for tetracycline. Prednisone/PrednisoloneOral steroids are often used to get the condition under control relatively quickly (within a month) and can be used after that as the sole therapy after the lowest effective maintenance dose is determined. Side effects include panting, excessive thirst and urination, and increased appetite. None of these effects are particularly desirable so often steroids are used in conjunction with one of the other therapies with the idea of dropping back the steroids when the second therapy can take over. Oral CyclosporineCylosporineis an immunomodulator that has found extensive use in veterinary medicine for a number of immune-mediated conditions including allergy. It can be used to control DLE but has some potential for side effects (mostly upset stomach) that might not be worthwhile for milder cases. 0.1% Tacrolimus (Protopic®)This is a topical immunomodulator made for human use. It is very effective for use in DLE and does not cause problems if licked. Only small amounts of ointment are needed and the tube should last a long time which is good news since it is not inexpensive. The person applying the medication should wear gloves to avoid unneeded exposure. If your dog is diagnosed with discoid lupus, discuss therapy options with your veterinarian. If your dog has a crusty or ulcerated nose, expect a biopsy to be needed to sort out the diagnosis properly before treatment can be prescribed.

Category: Fleas: Know your Enemy
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although there are over 2000 flea species in the world, pet owners should be concerned with only one:Ctenocephalides felis, the cat flea. This is the flea that we find on our pets (cats, dogs, rabbits, and other species) in 99.9 percent of cases. In order to understand how to control the damage caused by this tiny little animal, learn all you can about it. Fleas can cause serious health problems for you and your pet. Fleas aren’t just a nuisance! Fleas can kill. Fleas suck blood and blood loss leads toanemia. A heavy flea burden is lethal, especially to smaller or younger animals. The cat flea has even been known to kill animals as large as dairy calves through heavy infestation. Fleas can cause serious skin issuesFleas can cause severe itching and also other problems such as skin infections and hair loss. Some animals can become allergic to fleas, andflea allergy dermatitisis the most common skin disease of dogs and cats. Fleas can transmit infections and parasitesFleas can carry and transmit a bacterium calledBartonellathat can cause health issues in cats, dogs, and people. Fleas can carry a type of parasite, atapewormcalledDipylidium caninumthat can suck nutrients from the pet’s intestine and cause anal itching. Common Myths Even though fleas are the most common parasite in dogs and cats, there are many misconceptions about them. Myths that veterinarians hear about fleas almost every day are: Myth: My pet cannot have fleas because he lives entirely indoors. Fact:Fleas thrive particularly well in the well-regulated temperatures in the home. Myth: My pet cannot have fleas because if there were any fleas they would be biting (insert name of a person in the family reportedly sensitive to flea bites). Since this person is not being bitten, there must not be any fleas. Fact:The cat flea,Ctenocephalides felis, can suck the blood of a wide variety of animals. However, this flea definitely does not prefer human blood and won’t eat it unless absolutely necessary. Humans tend not to be bitten unless flea population numbers are high. Myth: We do not have fleas because we only have hardwood floors. Fact:Fleas love to develop in the cracks between the boards of hardwood floors. Myth: My pet cannot have fleas because I would see them. Fact:You cannot expect to see fleas because many animals will lick, groom, and chew after being bitten by a flea. This causes the flea to either jump off the pet or get swallowed. The Flea Life Cycle There are four life stages of the flea. For effective flea control, it is important to know how to break this life cycle in more than one place. The flea life cycle consists of egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. Eggs are laid in the hair coat and are designed to fall off your pet and into your home. Larvae hatch from the eggs and develop in a pet’s environment by feeding on adult flea feces (i.e. digested blood) that fall out of the hair coat of the pet. Larvae eventually spin cocoons, often within carpet fibers, for pupation. Pupae are resistant to freezing, drying, and insecticides, and can lie dormant for many months! New fleas develop from pupae and can begin feeding within hours of finding a dog or cat. The entire flea life cycle can be completed in as little as three weeks. Flea Control Strategies New ProductsToday, veterinarians have some greatflea control productsin our arsenal. There are now many effective and safe new products to choose from. Break the Flea Life CycleA two-step approach, targeting both the adult flea and the egg or larval flea forms, provides the most rapid control and the least resistance to flea control agents in future flea generations. Year-round Flea ControlFleas are also adaptive and the temperature controls how fast the flea completes its lifecycle. If you want to eradicate the flea population in a specific home, it is best to attack when numbers are low in the winter. Stopping flea control products in the winter may make it much harder to gain the upper hand in the spring and summer when the populations are rising. Rotate Flea ProductsOver time, only fleas resistant to an insecticide will survive. Periodically switching to another type of insecticide can be part of an effective flea control program to help reduce developing resistant fleas. Sadly, fleas are here to stay one way or the other. Know as much about this pest as you do about the dogs and cats that it feeds upon. You cannot know too much when it comes toflea control!

Category: Histiocytoma is a Benign Skin Growth in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The histiocytoma is a benign skin growth that usually goes away by itself within a couple of months. The typical histiocytoma patient is a young adult dog, usually less than two years of age, with a round eroded growth somewhere on the front half of its body. Of course, not every patient seems to have read the textbook. Such growths can be found on the rear legs or in older patients as well. Because there are other growths that can look just like a histiocytoma, it is important to get the right diagnosis, as the other conditions may not be as benign. What is a Histiocytoma? The histiocytoma is a tumor originating from what is called a Langerhans cell.All body areas that interface with the environment are rich with immunologic cells constantly sampling assorted organisms and proteins from the environment and presenting them to other cells of the immune system for further processing. Langerhans cells are cells that live in the skin where they happily sample materials entering and contacting our skin for immunologic presentation, as described above. A histiocytoma results when Langerhans cells become tumorous and generate visible growth. This growth is ultimately recognized by the immune system as something to destroy. The histiocytoma becomes infiltrated by T-lymphocytes and is ultimately destroyed by them, leaving the skin as it was. This process generates some inflammation, as one might expect, and requires two to three months to complete. Histiocytomas are especially common in Labrador retrievers, Staffordshire terriers, Boxers, and Dachshunds. The histiocytoma is not related to the malignant process called histiocytosis. What Else Might a Growth with this Appearance Be? There are several possibilities for this type of growth, often termed a button growth. The ringworm fungus, for example, can produce some raised round reactions called kerions that can look similar. The mast cell tumor, which is highly inflammatory, sometimes malignant, and must be excised widely so as to prevent a recurrence, can have an identical appearance. Melanoma can also appear as a similar lesion. If the patient is young, the chances are good that a benign process is afoot, but some testing will be needed to be sure. Finding Out for Sure Most of the time, the histiocytoma is small enough for easy removal, and the diagnosis comes up on the biopsy report, confirming that the tumor is benign and will not grow back. If the tumor is in a location where removal is not easy (such as the middle of the ear flap or dangerously close to the eye), there are two other options: a biopsy of a small piece of growth or a cytology exam. A biopsy may require sedation depending on the location of the growth. Sometimes, a local anesthetic is enough. A small piece of tissue is snipped off (or the entire lesion can be removed if it is small enough) and sent to the lab for analysis. In a few days, we will know for sure exactly what the growth is. Less costly but also less accurate, cells can be withdrawn from the lesion by a needle or simply collected from the tumor surface by pressing a microscope slide to the tumor surface. This omits the ability to see the architecture of the tissue, and just the cells are available for examination. This may be enough for the lab to confirm the identity of the growth in question. Treatment of Histiocytomas Histiocytomas heal by themselves within three months and may not need any treatment, depending on the case. The healing process may be itchy or may lead to secondary bacterial or fungal infections, which need to be treated for the area to fully heal. There have been some studies looking at immunomodulating drugs, or drugs that calm down immune responses, for the treatment of these growths. More research is necessary, and there are not any specific immunomodulating drugs recommended by veterinarians for histiocytomas at this time. On average, a histiocytoma undergoes regression by itself within three months. This process may be itchy or may lead to a minor infection. Removal of the histiocytoma is the fastest route to resolution, but since they do go away on their own, leaving the growth alone is reasonable (as long as we know for sure it is a histiocytoma). Any growth believed to be a histiocytoma that is still present after three months should definitely be removed and may very well turn out not to be a histiocytoma after all. Any histiocytoma that is eroded or seems uncomfortable should be removed rather than waiting through the regression process. Anti-inflammatory medications may be tempting, but these can interfere with the regression process. If the growth in question is in an area not readily amenable to surgery (ear flap, toe, tail, or some area where there is not a lot of extra skin for surgical closure, for example, cryotherapy (freezing) might be an option. Special equipment is needed for this, so if you are concerned about a growth, ask your veterinarian about the best approach. Removal of Histiocytomas Surgical removal of the histiocytoma is the fastest route to healing, but since they do go away on their own, leaving the growth alone is reasonable if: 1) your veterinarian has confirmed it is a histiocytoma, and 2) it is not very large, painful, or interfering with your pet’s daily activities. Cryotherapy, where your veterinarian freezes the area and removes the histiocytoma, is another option.  Usually, this method is recommended for tumors that need to be removed in places where surgery would be difficult, such as an eyelid, where the skin is more delicate. The prognosis (outlook) for histiocytomas of the skin is usually excellent as most of them will resolve on their own or be completely cured by removing surgically, with a very small percentage (less than 1%) potentially growing back.  Discuss treatment options and what to look out for with your veterinarian so your pet can hopefully get back to being comfortable as soon as possible.

Category: Interdigital Cysts in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What are Interdigital Cysts in Dogs? Interdigital cysts are large bumps, or nodules, between a dog’s toes.  They can also be called interdigital furuncles, follicular pododermatitis, or podofurunculosis.  Interdigital cysts usually appear as red nodules filled with blood and/or pus. They are most commonly found on the front paws. Dogs may limp from the pain, especially when walking on uneven surfaces or lick or chew at their paws. What Causes Interdigital Cysts? Any irritation or injury to the hairy skin of the paws can cause “plugged,” or dilated, hair follicles. These dilated follicles then develop into nodules that are prone to rupture, thus causing more irritation, and skin infections as well. When a dog develops interdigital cysts, it’s important to work with your veterinarian to determine why they’re occurring. Multiple factors may be involved, including: Hair coatDogs with short and coarse hair coats may be more likely to have inflamed and ruptured follicles.  Breeds with this type of hair coat include English bulldogs, Great Danes, Basset hounds, mastiffs, bull terriers, and boxers. Paw shapeDogs with wider paws can be more likely to bear weight on the haired skin between the pads.  Breeds with this type of paw shape, or conformation, include Labrador retrievers, English bulldogs, German shepherds, and Pekingese. ObesityDogs that are overweight can put more pressure interdigitally, or on the spaces between toes when walking. Difficulty walkingDogs that have arthritis or other joint problems can put more pressure on the interdigital spaces when walking. Licking and other itchy behaviorDogs that lick or chew at their paws can cause hair and skin irritation that leads to interdigital cysts. In these dogs, diagnosing and managing the underlying cause of itching, such asallergies, is part of treating and preventing interdigital cysts. EnvironmentSkin trauma from cages or rough ground can damage hair follicles.  How are they Diagnosed? Your dog’s veterinarian may need to take skin samples to diagnose and treat them because many other skin conditions can cause nodules on a dog’s paws. These skin conditions includedemodicosisor demodectic mange fromDemodexmites, skin cancers, and fungal infections. How are Interdigital Cysts Treated? Many becomeinfectedand need antibiotics. Your veterinarian may take a sample for a skin culture (bacterial culture and sensitivity) to choose the antibiotic. Anti-bacterial shampoos can also help treat the skin infection. If the paw swelling is severe, an anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the swelling and pain may be prescribed. Your veterinarian may also recommend surgical procedures or protective footwear. Your veterinarian will also work with you to determine what’s causing the interdigital cysts. If the underlying causes aren’t diagnosed and treated, they could return and cause scarring and difficulty walking. Diagnosing why your dog is developing them can reduce the need for medications, such as antibiotics, and make your pet more comfortable.

Category: Itching and Allergy in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Coping with an itchy pet can be an extremely frustrating experience for a pet owner and can truly test the limits of the human-animal bond. Persistent scratching and chewing by a dog can also result in open wounds to the skin and pain to your pet. The following information is intended to help provide pet owners with a basic understanding of the most common underlying causes of itching and allergies in small animals. Here’s a summary of the most common underlying causes of itching and allergies in small animals. What are the most common causes of chronic itching? Itching in dogs can involve not only scratching but also chewing, licking, and rubbing. The two most common causes of itching are external parasites and allergies. Examples of itchy external parasites on dogs arefleasand small bugs calledsarcoptic mange mites. What are the major types of allergies in dogs? Allergies are a common cause of skin and ear conditions in dogs. People with allergies usually have “hay fever” (watery eyes, runny nose and sneezing) or asthma. However, dogs with allergies rarely have respiratory signs from their allergies and instead usually have red and itchy skin, hair loss, or recurring skin or ear infections. What are the major types of allergies in dogs? Flea allergyFlea allergic dermatitis is the most common skin disease in dogs. For the flea allergic patient, 100% flea control is essential for remaining symptom-free. “But doctor, I never see fleas on my pet.”You may not see them, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there! Flea allergy is caused by the flea’s saliva, and it only takes a few bites to cause a problem. Also, an itchy dog often scratches so much that adult fleas are hard to find because they are removed from the body. “If fleas are the problem, why is my pet still itchy in the winter?”In warm climates or in our homes, fleas may survive in low numbers year-round. Because flea allergy is so common, many veterinarians recommend instituting complete flea control before proceeding with tests for itching. For most allergic dogs, year-round flea treatment is an important part of reducing itch. Food allergySome pets develop hypersensitivities to foods. Various food proteins, carbohydrates, or even preservatives or dyes can all be potential food allergens.There is currently no accurate blood or skin test to determine if your dog has a food allergy.The only method of diagnosing a food allergy is by placing your dog on a carefully selected prescription or homemade hypoallergenic diet for several weeks, which is called afood trial. The diet only contains ingredients your dog has never eaten before. If the allergy signs resolve, a food challenge is performed by feeding the former diet and watching for a return of the itching. If this occurs, a diagnosis of food allergy is confirmed. Atopic dermatitisAtopic dermatitis is a type of allergy. Skin or ear inflammation occurs in response to a variety of normally harmless substances, such as plant pollens, house dust mites, and other environmental allergens.Allergy testsof the skin or blood help us compile a list of allergens for a “vaccine” (allergen specific immunotherapy) to decrease the pet’s sensitivity. Secondary infectionsAllergies are often the underlying cause of recurring skin and/or ear infections. Bacterial and yeast infections, though secondary to the allergy, can increase your pet’s level of itching. Long-term treatment with antibiotics and anti-yeast medications is commonly required, along with medicated bathing programs. Can allergies be cured? Unfortunately, there is no cure for allergy and it is usually a life-long problem. We seek to control allergies and improve the quality of life for both you and your dog. We will formulate the best program of management that suits all involved with your dog’s care. Can the itching be treated without the expense of diagnostic testing? There are many anti-allergy medications to reduce itching. These medications do not cure allergies but can help decrease the symptoms. However without addressing the underlying cause of the allergy, the itching will return when the medication is stopped. Long-term use of some anti-allergy medications, such as steroids, can result in many health problems. Working with your veterinarian to diagnose the underlying cause of the allergy and itching may reduce the need for medications or enable your veterinarian to use more specific and targeted allergy treatments.

Category: Localized Demodectic Mange in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The Culprit -Demodex Canis Demodectic mange, also called "demodicosis," is caused by one of the microscopic mites of theDemodexgenus. The most common mite of demodectic mange isDemodex canis. All dogs raised normally by their mothers possess this mite as mites are transferred from mother to pup via cuddling during the first few days of life. Most dogs live in harmony with their mites, never suffering any consequences from being parasitized. If, however, conditions change to upset the natural equilibrium (such as some kind of suppression of the dog's immune system), theDemodexmites may "gain the upper hand." The mites proliferate and can cause skin disease. Is Demodicosis Contagious? Unlikesarcoptic mange, demodectic mange is not considered a contagious disease, and isolation of affected dogs is generally not considered necessary. That said, there are some circumstances under which the mites could spread from one dog to another. Classically Demodex mites have been felt to only be transferable from mother to newborn pup. After the pup is a week or so old, it has developed enough immunity so that infection is no longer possible. In other words, after age one week or so, a dog will no longer accept new mites on its body. Recently this idea has been challenged as occasionally multiple unrelated dogs break out with demodicosis in the same household. It is not clear if some species of Demodex are more contagious than others or if some contagion is possible under certain circumstances. Current thinking is that mites can actually be transferred from one dog to another, but as long as the dog is healthy, the mites simply add to the dog's natural mite population, and no skin disease results. In rare circumstances spread of disease is possible if a severe infection is involved. While there are still assorted theories about dog-to-dog transmission of Demodex mites. Mites cannot be transmitted to humans or to cats. What is Localized Demodectic Mange (also called Localized Demodicosis)? Demodicosis has three forms:generalized(large areas of skin),pododermatitis(severe foot infection), and localized (only a few spots). The subject shown here is the localized form which is the mildest form. It is usually addressed readily with an isoxazoline flea product, and a single dose is enough to resolve the problem. Most of the time, it resolves with no treatment at all. Localized demodicosis occurs as isolated, scaly bald patches, usually on the dog's face, creating a polka-dot appearance. Localized demodicosis is considered a common puppyhood ailment and approximately 90% of cases resolve with no treatment of any kind. This is quite a contrast to generalized demodicosis, where large areas of the body surface are involved, so it is important to be able to distinguish localized from generalized disease. It seems like this would be a simple task since localized demodicosis classically involves several round facial bald spots, and generalized demodicosis involves a bald, scaly entire dog; still, reality does not always fit into neat categories in this way. Some guidelines used to distinguish localized demodicosis include: Treatment Treatment is not necessary for localized demodicosis, but there are treatment options for people who simply cannot feel right if they don't do something. For one thing, flea control products of the isoxazoline class (Simparica®, Nexgard®, Credelio®, and Bravecto®) readily kill Demodex mites, and the simplest treatment is to employ one of these as the patient's flea control product. Any Demodex mites will be killed as a bonus. Topical antibiotic ointments are usually not needed and may temporarily redden the skin. Applying a topical can also break off some of the local hairs, causing the spot to appear to be enlarging. Neither of these situations makes the condition worse, but it might appear to be getting worse for the reasons mentioned. As for traditional treatments, Goodwinol ointment, an insecticidal ointment, may be used daily to control localized demodicosis. Antibacterial gels are also used against localized demodicosis and associated skin infections. It is important to note that rubbing a creme or ointment on a demodicosis lesion can cause it to redden, making it appear to get worse. It is also possible that rubbing will break off the weaker hairs at the margin of the lesion, causing the lesion to appear to get bigger. Neither of these situations truly represents an exacerbation of the disease. Resolution of a localized demodicosis lesion should be at least partially apparent after one month though total resolution can take up to three months. Approximately 10% of localized demodicosis cases will progress to generalized demodicosis. Enlarged lymph nodes are a bad sign, often foretelling generalized mange. Should the mange progress to the generalized form, more aggressive treatment will likely be needed. Can the Pup be Bred Later?Sometimes the puppy with localized demodicosis was obtained for breeding purposes. The current recommendation is not to treat these puppies so that we can determine if the condition will stay localized and resolve or if it will generalize. If it stays localized and eventually resolves without treatment, the animal is still a candidate for breeding. If the condition generalizes to cover the entire body, the animal should be sterilized. If the condition receives treatment and resolves, it is not known how the disease would have gone in its natural state and will not know whether the pup is carrying the genetic predisposition for generalized demodectic mange. In this case, it is best to be conservative and not take the chance of passing on genetic predisposition for this disease. Localized demodicosis is almost exclusively a puppyhood disease. When a puppy develops localized demodicosis, the chance of the condition resolving is 90 percent unless there is a family history of demodicosis in related dogs. In this case, the chance of spontaneous resolution drops to 50 percent. Occasionally an adult dog develops localized demodicosis, but localized demodicosis usually represents nothing more than the stresses and strains that are normal in puppyhood.

Category: Muzzle Folliculitis and Furunculosis (Chin Acne, Muzzle Acne) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Muzzle folliculitis and furunculosis (chin acne, muzzle acne) is inflammation of the muzzle and lips in dogs. It occurs most often in young dogs of short-coated breeds. When dogs play or rub the chin area, hairs are broken and pushed beneath the skin surface. This leads to skin irritation, inflammation, and infection. Dogs present with bumps and redness under the chin and on the lips. Your veterinarian may obtainskin samplesfrom your dog and examine them under a microscope to look for a bacterial infection (pyoderma), yeast infection (Malassezia), or parasite (Demodex mitecausing demodicosis. If the bacterial skin infection is severe and needs an antibiotic, your veterinarian may send a sample to a laboratory for a skin culture. Occasionally, your vet may also take samples to look for a fungal infection (ringworm). Treatment may include topical or oral medications to treat skin infection and inflammation. Because some dogs rub the muzzle fromitchingyour veterinarian may also discuss allergies and other causes of itching.

Category: Perianal Fistulae in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called perineal fistulae, anorectal abscesses, perianal fissures, perianal sinuses, and pararectal fistulae.) Most people are not in the habit of inspecting the area under their dog’s tail unless the dog seems to be doing something that indicates a problem. Signs of a problem might include licking under the tail, scooting the rear end on the ground, or seeming to be in pain when sitting or raising the tail. When the tail is lifted and the anus inspected, a dog with perianal fistulae will show deep open crevices and some oozing pus all around the anal sphincter. It may not be possible to get a good look as pain may preclude lifting the tail, but odor may be noted, and the dog might be straining to defecate. There is also an association of perianal fistulae with the mucous diarrhea of colitis so that might be seen as well. Perianal fistulae wax and wane but ultimately over time the condition is progressive, ulcerating the surface of the anus and its surroundings. What Causes this Condition? At this time, no one knows but recent information suggests an immune-mediated basis. There seems to be some genetic basis as the German shepherd dog seems predisposed to this condition, though this phenomenon may be more about conformation than about a specific genetic factor for the disease. Relative to other breeds, the German shepherd dog has an increased number of apocrine sweat glands, the type of sweat glands that produce stinky oily sweat (as opposed to watery sweat) in the anal area relative to other breeds. The average age of onset is 5 years and approximately twice as many males are affected as females. While any breed can be affected, 85% of affected dogs are German shepherd dogs. Theanal glandsmay or may not be involved in the fistulation, but there seems to be a clear association with concurrent colitis (inflammation of the colon), as mentioned. Approximately 85% of affected dogs are German shepherd dogs. What Else Could it Be? Several conditions can produce ulcerative lesions around the anal sphincter. While perianal fistulae have a typical history and appearance, it is important to get the right diagnosis. Some conditions that might look similar include: Treatment This condition is an immune-mediated disease. Treatment centers on suppressing the immune reaction that is causing the problem, and this means immunosuppressive drugs will be the centerpiece of therapy. Realize from the beginning that, while improvement is evident within a couple of weeks, it will take 2 to 5 months to get the lesions fully under control and that maintenance therapy may be needed for the remainder of the animal’s life. The good news is that control can usually be achieved and continued with maintenance levels of medication. Immune Suppression Years ago, an assortment of surgical procedures were used to trim the diseased tissues of the perineal fistulae but immunomodulating drugs have largely supplanted surgery. In particular, two medications have emerged:cyclosporine(an oral drug) and tacrolimus (a topical drug). Many dogs will need both to control their disease at least at first, but often the topical product can be used alone once the pain has been controlled. CyclosporineCyclosporine was originally developed for organ transplant patients to prevent organ rejection by modulating the immune response without necessarily suppressing it. Medication is given twice daily and improvement should be seen within the first two weeks of use. Cyclosporine is an expensive medication and there is tremendous controversy over whether or not generics are bioequivalent. Only microemulsion forms of cyclosporine are effective which usually means a brand-name veterinary product. Higher-dose protocols seem to yield faster, more sustained results. As mentioned, improvement is typically obvious within the first two weeks though several months are needed for the resolution of lesions. After the disease is controlled, cyclosporine may be tapered off over another 3-5 months. Approximately 50% of dogs will not be able to fully discontinue medications and their symptoms will recur within 2-12 months if a maintenance schedule is not implemented. This could involve tacrolimus (see below) or cyclosporine or both. Cyclosporine tissue levels can be boosted (and expense mitigated) with the concurrent use ofketoconazole, an antifungal drug. This trick can be used to cut the dose of cyclosporine and save money. There is controversy regarding whether blood levels of cyclosporine help determine dose and what the relationship is between tissue levels and blood levels. Because of the long-term use needed to control perianal fistulae, it is best to monitor liver enzymes or liver function tests in the patient; cyclosporine blood levels may or may not be recommended by your doctor. TacrolimusTacrolimus is a much stronger immunomodulator than cyclosporine. Because it can be applied directly to the fistulae, high tissue levels can be achieved right in the area they are needed. The potential for side effects and expense is also much more favorable than that of cyclosporine, but only 50 percent of dogs experienced resolution with tacrolimus alone after 16 weeks versus 85 percent with cyclosporine. In a perfect world, both oral cyclosporine and topical tacrolimus are used at the same time but after the condition is controlled, tacrolimus alone can be used to prevent recurrence. It is important to wear gloves when applying tacrolimus as this medication has been linked to an increased risk of cancer in humans but not in dogs. Other OptionsCyclosporine currently dominates treatment for this condition but it is an expensive drug and it may not be feasible to use it for months on end in a large breed dog. In this event, prednisolone has been used but there are undesirable side effects with high-dose steroid use (extreme thirst, increased appetite, weight gain, panting, muscle loss) and approximately 30 percent of dogs will not respond. Azathioprineis a stronger immune-suppressive drug. The above side effects are not associated with its use though bone marrow suppression is possible and some monitoring tests are generally recommended. Because it takes some time to exert its effects, it is commonly combined withprednisoloneat least at first. Approximately 50 percent of dogs were able to achieve remission with azathioprine in combination with a limited-ingredient diet (see below). Supportive Therapy Beyond Immune Suppression AntibioticsSince these lesions are commonly infected at least at the beginning of treatment, antibiotics are typically prescribed. A topical antibiotic may be helpful for long-term infection control. It is important to realize that antibiotics alone will not control this deeply rooted problem; they are merely adjunctive to control complicating infections. Stool SoftenersBecause of the ulcerations, defecation may be painful. To minimize the straining, stool softeners may be prescribed. Novel Protein / Limited Ingredient DietFood allergy seems to be a possible etiology in this condition so using foods that the patient could not possibly be allergic to has been a recommended adjunctive therapy. Such diets are typically made from unusual protein sources such as rabbit, duck, kangaroo, fish, or venison. Most veterinary hospitals stock appropriate food. It is important to note that there is nothing especially hypoallergenic about these unusual proteins; the idea is that the patient has likely never eaten them before. If the patient has never been exposed to these proteins, there should be no possibility of allergy as developing allergy requires multiple exposures to a protein.  In one study, 50 percent of the dogs with perianal fistulae also hadcolitis(colon inflammation and associated mucous diarrhea). If this is not a coincidence, then the fistulae should respond to some of the treatments that help colitis and this would include a hypoallergenic diet. Surgery: If Immune Suppression Fails Before we had cyclosporine, perianal fistulae were treated surgically with mixed results. Presently, surgery is only recommended for patients for whom immunosuppression has failed or where the anal glands are involved. The goal of surgery is to remove the proliferative or dead tissue, prevent or treat any anal or rectal strictures (narrowed areas caused by scarring), and change the “environment” of the perineal region. Tail amputation may be required; in one study, tail amputation alone was 80 percent successful in preventing recurrence. If the anal glands are involved in the fistulae, they will have to be removed. In milder cases, chemical cauterization of fistulae (which destroys abnormal tissue and allows normal tissue to heal in) may be helpful. Cryotherapy, where a freezing agent is used instead of a chemical one, has been less effective (more scarring, less control over the area treated, etc.) Laser therapy, on the other hand, has been 95 percent successful in preventing recurrence and controlling pain (20 percent of patients developed fecal incontinence but most of these cases were controlled with diet). The more extensive the surgery, the more the potential for complications. Stool softeners are typically needed for a month after surgery and the owner should be comfortable cleaning the anal area. Fecal incontinence narrowed anus, and inability to control the fistulation are the chief complications with surgery.

Translating Return to English Ringworm Environmental Decontamination: How to Clean Your Home When Your Pet Has Ringworm Dermatophytosis, commonly calledringworm, is a fungal infection of the fur and skin of dogs and cats. When your pet has ringworm, it is really important to clean and disinfect your home to prevent the spread of ringworm to other pets and to people. How to Clean and Disinfect the Home Thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the home when a pet has ringworm is called environmental decontamination and is a two-step process.STEP 1: Remove pet hairWipe, sweep, and/or vacuum the surface then thoroughly wash the surface until visibly clean of pet hair. Remove any excess water before Step 2.STEP 2: Disinfect the surface.Apply disinfectant and let sit for 5 min.Step 1 is the most important step because many surfaces can be rid of ringworm by removing pet hair. Additionally, many disinfectants do not work in the presence of debris. Below is a guide to cleaning and disinfecting various materials. Information is summarized from publications by veterinary dermatologist Dr. Karen Moriello of the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine.

Category: Sarcoptic Mange in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Sarcoptic mange, also called scabies, is an itchy disease in dogs caused by a mite (Sarcoptes scabiei var canis). Sarcoptic mites are small and not visible to the naked eye. They burrow into the skin and cause itching, redness, and skin crusts at the tips of the ears, elbows, hocks, chest and belly. In a severe infestation, Sarcoptic mites cause problems on the animal's entire body. How is sarcoptic mange (scabies) diagnosed? Your veterinarian will look for the mite by performingseveral skin scrapingson your dog and examining the debris under a microscope. Unfortunately, in many dogs with sarcoptic mange, the skin scrapings do not contain any mites. This is because only a small number of mites on your dog's body can cause severe symptoms. If sarcoptic mange is suspected, your pet's veterinarian will recommend treatment for the mites. How is sarcoptic mange (scabies) treated?Several prescription medicines can be used to kill mites. These medicines come in various forms including: Your pet’s veterinarian may also prescribe other medicines to treat itching while the mite medication takes effect.No matter which treatment is chosen, follow the instructions from your pet’s veterinarian. For some medicines, the amount needed to treat sarcoptic mange is different than the amount needed to treat other health conditions. If you give the medicine less often or in a smaller amount than what your pet’s veterinarian recommends, your pet’s sarcoptic mange will not get better.Can my other pets or my family get sarcoptic mange (scabies)?Yes. Sarcoptic mange is highly contagious and can spread from pet to pet or from pet to human. Treat all other dogs in the household. Although mites can only survive a brief time off the dog, clean your dog’s living quarters and wash or throw away the bedding. If your dog has sarcoptic mange and anyone in your family has red and itchy skin bumps, consult your family physician.Your dog may remain contagious for two to four weeks after starting treatment. Please keep your dog confined and away from other dogs and unexposed persons until your dog’s re-check veterinary appointment.

Category: Schnauzer Comedone Syndrome
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Schnauzer comedone syndrome? In Schnauzer comedone syndrome, dogs develop multiple comedones (blackheads) on the back and neck. These small skin bumps develop when a pore, the skin’s opening for each hair, becomes clogged with skin oils and debris.  Despite the name, Schnauzer comedone syndrome can occur in non-Schnauzer breeds such as Cairn terriers and other rough-coated terriers. It is also called Schnauzer comedo syndrome, Schnauzer back, and Schnauzer back bumps. How is it diagnosed? Your dog’s veterinarian may need to take skin and other samples to diagnose and treat it. This is because many other skin conditions can cause comedones in dogs, includingdemodicosisor demodectic mange fromDemodexmites. What causes Schnauzer comedone syndrome? No one really knows what causes Schnauzer comedone syndrome. However, it may be an inherited condition because it occurs more commonly in certain dog breeds. How is Schnauzer comedone syndrome treated? Schnauzer comedone syndrome cannot be curred but can be treated. To loosen and dissolve the comedones, your pet’s veterinarian may recommend atopical therapy, such as a medicated antiseborrheic shampoo or ointment. If comedones becomeinfected, they may need to be treated with an antibiotic. Your pet’s veterinarian may take a sample for a skin culture (bacterial culture and sensitivity) to choose the antibiotic. Especially if the skin infection is itchy or painful, your pet’s veterinarian may do some tests to determine if your dog has other health conditions that are making the Schnauzer comedone syndrome bumps worse.

Category: Seasonal Flank Alopecia in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Also called canine flank alopecia, cyclic flank alopecia, and recurrent flank alopecia. What is Seasonal Flank Alopecia? Seasonal flank alopecia is exactly what it sounds like, though it helps to know that the word alopecia means hair loss. With seasonal flank alopecia, a dog loses hair in the flank area on a seasonal basis. Different dogs seem to choose different seasons to lose their hair (fall and spring are popular), and when the season changes, the hair generally grows back. Sometimes a dog will skip a season only to lose hair again the next year. Most affected breeds are Boxers, Airedales, and English bulldogs, though numerous other breeds have been affected. The hair loss is generally confined to the flanks (the area just ahead of the rear legs) though sometimes the bridge of the nose is involved. The skin is typically darkly pigmented in the areas of hair loss. Both flanks are generally affected symmetrically, and sometimes, there is a skin infection in the balding areas. Sometimes the hair re-grows in a different color than the original hair. Some dogs never re-grow their hair. Diagnosis is generally made by the classic appearance of the pigmented bald spot and the history of recurrence. Diagnosis can be confirmed with skin biopsy if more confirmation is desired. Why Does this Happen? At the present time, no one knows why this occurs. It is felt to relate to the effects that the daylight cycle and light exposure have on the pineal gland. Shorter days seem to lead to a decrease in melatonin from the pineal gland, leading to skin change. Breed predisposition suggests a genetic factor as well. Dogs of any age can be affected, but the average age is about four years. Are There Treatment Options? Melatonin, a natural biochemical that is important in regulating circadian (daily) rhythms, has been used successfully in many patients. In the U.S., this product is available as an oral dietary supplement or as an implant for use under the skin. Oral Therapy Melatonin is sometimes used as a sleep aid in people, and the only known side effect is drowsiness. Dosing regimens must be obtained from the veterinarian treating your dog, but typically, oral melatonin is given 2-3 times daily. If the seasonal nature of the condition becomes predictable, it may be useful to begin the supplements a month or two before the hair loss is expected. It is important to realize that nutritional supplements are not regulated in the same way that prescription drugs are. This means that the manufacturer of a nutritional supplement is not required to prove that the product actually contains the amount of active ingredient it claims to have. A study on melatonin products from the University of Tennessee found tremendous variability in content among different brands. The most consistent and accurate brand was found to be Nature's Bounty, so this is the brand that most dermatologists recommend. Under Skin (Subcutaneous) Implant A more effective method involves the use of melatonin implants under the skin. These were not available in the U.S. until recently. A small implant the size of a grain of rice is implanted under the skin and between the shoulders much in the same way as a microchip ID. If hair regrows and it seems to work, a new implant can be inserted every 4-6 months. Some drowsiness can be a side effect for the first one to three days, and occasionally a sterile abscess forms at the site, necessitating removal. Seasonal flank alopecia is a cosmetic problem that is not harmful to the dog. It is not unreasonable to leave it untreated. Discuss these options with your veterinarian.

Category: Sebaceous Adenitis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is a Sebaceous Gland? Everyone has heard skin described as dry, oily, or normal, which refers to the amount of natural oil on the skin surface. The oils of the skin are important moisturizers as they hold water inside the skin and prevent its evaporation. The oil also acts as an important part of the skin's protective barrier keeping irritants or even infectious organisms away from the skin cells below. The skin's barrier function is complex and multi-faceted but it is the oil portion that concerns us with sebaceous adenitis. The oils that coat the skin come from “sebaceous glands” which are oil secreting glands that feed into the hair follicles. Hair follicles are small holes from which a hair grows. The oil is secreted into the follicle, eventually making its way out of the follicle and onto the surface of the skin. Sebaceous Adenitis Means Inflammation of the Sebaceous Glands In early stages of sebaceous adenitis, skin biopsies show glands in the throes of the inflammatory process. In later stages, the inflammation has more or less destroyed the glands so they are simply absent from the biopsy sample. Knowing the stage of the disease is important in determining what therapy will help: if the inflammation is still active, there is some chance at saving at least some of the glands. No one knows what causes sebaceous adenitis, but we know that certain breeds are predisposed (which means there is most likely a genetic component). In the Standard Poodle, sebaceous adenitis is likely a recessive genetic trait, though not all dogs who are genetically able to express the disease will actually go on to actually express the disease. We think a similar situation exists for the Akita. Affected dogs should be registered with theOrthopedic Foundation for Animalsso that the heredity of the trait can be tracked. Other breeds that seem to have a genetic predisposition to sebaceous adenitis include the Chow Chow, Samoyed, Viszla, and Havanese (particularly prone to lesions on the ears) but any dog breed can be affected. What Does an Affected Dog Look Like? This depends a great deal on whether the hair is short or more plush/fluffy. The condition is generally not itchy unless there is an accompanying bacterial infection in the skin, which probably happens in about 40% of affected dogs. In other words, sebaceous adenitis may or may not be itchy, depending on whether there is a concurrent infection. For short-haired dogs, a fine white dandruff begins on the head and ears that ultimately progress to the whole body. Scaling areas tend to be round or S-shaped. For long-haired or plush-coated breeds, the scale is most obvious as a clump of dandruff sticking to a group of hairs. The coat is dull and brittle and tends to develop a reddish tint. In time, bald spots develop. Again, usually, the head is where problems start. Biopsy of the skin is required for diagnosis. Treatment Response to therapy largely depends on whether there are still living sebaceous glands in the biopsy sample or not. If there are no glands left and they have all been destroyed, it will be much harder to get a response though it is possible for glands to regenerate with treatment. The inflammation that destroyed (or is destroying) the sebaceous glands must be stopped. Furthermore, new hair growth depends on a coat of sebum (skin oil), so if the patient's skin is not making adequate skin oil, the oil must be replaced. TopicalOil replacement treatments are performed frequently at first and taper down to less frequent applications after the first month. Every dermatologist seems to have their own preferred regimen, so here are some typical recommendations: Mineral oil, mineral bath oil (such as Alpha Keri®), or propylene glycol mixed with water, sprayed onto the coat or affected area of the coat, rubbed in, and shampooed out with a degreasing shampoo after a one-hour soak. This is performed typically once a week for the first month, then as needed. There are topical products that enhance the barrier function of the skin, and these can be used to assist therapy. Omega 6 fatty acid topicals are also becoming more popular as an easy way to replenish skin oil as they are easily applied as a top spot. Oral SupplementsOral omega-3 fatty acids are almost always included in the treatment regimen. Vitamin A has been advocated for sebaceous adenitis but seems to be fading out of popularity with the advent of other oral treatments (see below). Oral MedicationCyclosporine seems to be at the heart of treatment for the more severely affected dogs; further, on cyclosporine, dogs with only two percent of their sebaceous glands left have been able to increase this number to 40 percent. Cyclosporine is an immunomodulator that is able to suppress the inflammation that is destroying the sebaceous glands.Patients may need ongoing low dose therapy. Synthetic retinoids have held a great deal of promise in treating sebaceous adenines, but they are tightly regulated by the government and are not readily available for veterinary patients. Immunomodulation withdoxycyclineis an emerging therapy but is still in the investigational stage. Doxycycline is, first and foremost, an antibiotic but has numerous immunomodulating properties as well and is used widely to treat immune-mediated disease. Managing a dog with this condition can be labor-intensive for the dog's lifespan. The amount of work needed at home depends on the individual dog's response to therapy. Marked improvement is typically realized within 4 months of treatment, but it is important to realize this can be a high-maintenance skin disease.

Category: Seborrhea in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dogs with seborrhea have excessive scaling and flaking of the skin. The seborrhea may be dry or oily and greasy. Additionally, there may be reddened or pigmented areas of skin inflammation and an odor to the skin. Many of the symptoms of seborrhea are worse in the folds of the skin, especially on the neck and underneath the body. The odor associated with seborrhea can be worsened by bacterial skin (Staphylococcal pyoderma) or yeast (Malassezia) skin infections. Many seborrhea patients also have ear problems (otitis). There are two forms of seborrhea, primary and secondary seborrhea. Primary, or idiopathic, seborrhea is most commonly seen in breeds such as Cocker Spaniels, West Highland White Terriers, and Basset Hounds. Secondary seborrhea is more common and occurs when another disease causes excessive scaling and flaking of the skin. Many diseases can trigger secondary seborrhea, including hormonal imbalances, allergies, parasites, or fungal or bacterial skin infections, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity changes. For primary seborrhea, there is no cure. However, synthetic vitamin A derivatives, called retinoids, or other medications often help. For secondary seborrhea, the treatment involves diagnosing and managing the underlying disease that is causing the seborrhea. A key method for controlling the symptoms of either primary or secondary seborrhea is using antiseborrheic shampoos. Several shampoos may need to be tried before the best one for your pet is found. Sometimes, two different shampoos or topical treatments may be needed.

Category: Strangles in Puppies
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Also called juvenile cellulitis or sterile granulomatous dermatitis and lymphadenitis Puppy strangles is a classical disease though fortunately not a common one. It comes up suddenly, manifesting as marked swelling of the muzzle, eyelids, and face in a puppy between the ages of 3 weeks and 6 months of age. The owner may be inclined to think the puppy was bitten by a stinging insect or a spider. Soon the lymph nodes of the throat become spectacularly enlarged, giving the puppy the appearance of having the mumps. It doesn’t take long for the swelling to give way to pimples that rupture, bleed, and crust. The inner surface of the ear flaps are commonly involved as well and occasionally lesions in other body areas occur. Lesions are painful more than they are itchy. Fever, joint swelling, and loss of appetite occur in approximately 25 percent of patients. If treatment is delayed, permanent hair loss can result in the most severely affected areas. If the puppy is sick enough, the condition can be life-threatening. Predisposed breeds include the Golden Retriever, Dachshund, and Gordon Setter. Treatment Despite the extreme inflammation and secondary infections, the heart of treatment for this condition is immune-suppression. High doses of corticosteroids such asprednisoneare needed as this condition is an immune-mediated disease and no specific underlying cause has been identified. In other words, the puppy’s immune system is acting excessively and inappropriately and it must be subdued. Antibiotics may be needed for the secondary infections but antibiotics alone will not treat this condition. Once suppression of the overly active immune system occurs, improvement is usually rapid. Puppies with strangles have a fairly characteristic appearance and are usually diagnosed on that basis. That said, because the treatment involves suppressing the immune system, it is best to rule out conditions that might look similar but for which immune suppression would be inappropriate.Generalized demodectic mange, an infection involving mange mites, also has a facial orientation and can look similar to juvenile cellulitis. Skin scrapes can be performed to check for the presence of mites. A skin biopsy should settle any questions about what condition is present. A severe infection can be ruled out by looking at samples of the pimple contents under the microscope, noting that no bacteria are present despite the dramatic number of inflammatory cells. A secondary infection, though, can be present in which case the doctor must use clinical judgment about the appearance of the lesions and the patient’s history to make the diagnosis. The condition generally resolves in 10 to 14 days and does not recur.

Category: Ticks Are Arthropod Parasites for Mammals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Ticks are skin parasites that feed on the blood of their hosts. Ticks like motion, warm temperatures from body heat, and the carbon dioxide exhaled by mammals, so they are attracted to such hosts as dogs, cats, rodents, rabbits, cattle, small mammals, etc. The bite itself is not usually painful, but the parasite can transmit diseases and causetick paralysis, which is why tick control is so important. (Removing the ticks leads to rapid improvement of the paralysis.) The minimal amount of time it takes for an attached tick to transmit disease is not known. The time it takes to transmit diseases is affected by the type of disease organism, the species of tick, etc. However, in general, if a tick is removed within 16 hours, the risk of disease transmission is considered to be very low. Therefore, owners can usually prevent disease transmission to their pets by following a regular schedule to look for and remove ticks. The Tick Life Cycle Most types of ticks require three hosts during a 2-3 year lifespan.  Each tick stage requires a blood meal before it can reach the next stage. Hard ticks have four life stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Larvae and nymphs must feed before they detach and molt. Adult female ticks can engorge, increasing their weight by more than 100-fold. After detaching, an adult female tick can lay approximately 3,000 eggs. During the egg-laying stage, ticks lay eggs in secluded areas with dense vegetation. The eggs hatch within two weeks. Some species of ticks lay 100 eggs at a time, while others lay 3,000 to 6,000 per batch. Once the eggs hatch, the ticks are in the larval stage, during which time the larvae move into the grass and search for their first blood meal. At this stage, they will attach themselves for several days to their first host, usually a bird or rodent, and then fall onto the ground. The nymph stage begins after the first blood meal is completed. Nymphs remain inactive during winter and start moving again in spring. Nymphs find a host, usually a rodent, pet, or human. Nymphs are generally about the size of a freckle. After this blood meal, ticks fall off the host and move into the adult stage. Throughout the autumn, male and female adults find a host, which is again usually a rodent, pet, or human. The adult female feeds for 8 to 12 days. The female mates while still attached to her host. Both ticks fall off, and the males die. The female remains inactive through the winter and in the spring lays her eggs in a secluded place. If adults cannot find a host animal in the fall, they can survive in leaf litter until the spring. What are the best ways to deal with these blood-sucking parasites? Outdoor Environmental Control Treating the yard and outdoor kennel area with acaricides (tick pesticides) is an important tool in the arsenal against ticks. Some products can be used to spray the outdoor area. However, you should not rely on spraying to reduce your risk of infection. If you have health concerns about applying acaricides, check with local health or agricultural officials about the best time toapply acaricides in your area, identify rules and regulations related to pesticide application on residential properties, and consider using a professional pesticide company to apply pesticides at your home. You can also create a tick-safe zone in your yard by using some simple landscaping techniques that can help reduce tick populations: Indoor Environmental ControlIf ticks are indoors, flea and tick foggers, sprays, or powders can be used. Inside, ticks typically crawl (they don't jump) and may be in cracks around windows and doors. A one-foot barrier of insecticide, where the carpeting and wall meet, can help with tick control. Preventing Ticks from Attaching If your pet goes outside regularly, you can use some type of residual insecticide on your pet. Talk to your veterinarian about what works best in your geographic area. If you use a liquid spray treatment, cats and skittish dogs typically prefer a pump bottle because of the noise from aerosol cans. Doubling the amount of anti-tick product, or using two at once, may cause toxicity problems.Any spray insecticide labeled for use on clothing should not be sprayed directly on pets. Powders are fairly easy to apply, but they can be messy. (Avoid topical powders if your pet has a respiratory condition.) Shampoos are useful only for ticks that are already on your pet. A tick collar might be somewhat more water-resistant than a residual insecticide, so if your dog likes to swim, the collar might be a better choice. Flea combs can be used to help remove ticks and wash your pet's bedding frequently. Finding and Removing Ticks The best way to find ticks on your pet is to run your hands over the whole body. Check for ticks every time your pet comes back from an area you know is inhabited by ticks. Ticks attach most frequently around the pet's head, ears, neck, and feet, but they are not restricted to those areas. There are several tick removal devices on the market, but a plain set of fine-tipped tweezers will remove a tick quite effectively. How To Remove A Tick With Tweezers Risk of disease transmission to you, while removing ticks, is low but you should wear gloves if you wish to be perfectly safe. Do not apply hot matches, petroleum jelly, turpentine, nail polish, or just rubbing alcohol alone. These methods do not remove the ticks and they are not safe for your pet. Rubbing alcohol could be used to disinfect the area before or after removing the tick. Watch for Infection and Diseases After you pull a tick off, there will be a local area of inflammation that could look red, crusty, or scabby. The tick’s attachment causes irritation. The site can get infected; if the pet is scratching at it, it is more apt to get infected. A mild topical antibiotic, such as over-the-counter triple antibiotic ointment, can help but usually is not necessary. The inflammation should go down within a week. If it stays crusty and inflamed longer than a week, it might have become infected. Various diseases can be transmitted by ticks includinganaplasmosis,babesiosis,ehrlichiosis,Lyme disease,tick paralysis(or tick toxicosis), and others. Not all species of animals (pets or not) are affected similarly by every tick-borne illness. Although ticks can transmit diseasescontracted from a previous hostto pets and humans, they are usually nothing more than a nuisance. The best approach is to prevent them from embedding and once embedded, to remove them quickly. If you notice your pet experiencing signs of illness or acting differently after a tick bite, it is always best to see your veterinarian. If you stay on top of the situation, your pets should cruise right through the tick season with no problems.

Category: Viral Papillomas of Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Does my Dog Have Warts? Certain viruses are able to cause the growth of small round skin tumors commonly referred to as warts. Everyone who has ever seen a drawing of a fairy tale witch knows what warts look like, so when the family dog develops small round skin growths, many people assume these, too, are harmless warts. It is important to realize that viral warts are a specific condition and that a growth on the dog’s skin may or may not be a viral wart. Very few skin growths can be identified visually and many types of skin growths look similar.  Before assuming a growth is "just a wart," it is a good idea to learn about warts (viral papillomas) in case what you are seeing doesn't really fit and needs further evaluation. Human warts are round, somewhat flat, and relatively smooth. Viral warts in dogs tend to possess frond-like structures (called fimbriae), creating more of a sea anemone or cauliflower-like appearance, though they can be smooth as well. The classical viral wart patient is a young dog with warts in or around the mouth or eyes. In cases where warts have a typical appearance in a classic patient, diagnosis may be obvious, but in older patients with warts in locations other than the face, other types of growths become more likely. Because many types of growths can appear harmless but behave malignantly, removal and biopsy are often recommended, especially if the appearance of the growth and/or patient does not fit into what is considered typical. It is usually not possible to identify a growth visually though there are some exceptions. Do not be surprised if what you are assuming is a wart is reallysomething else. In dogs, we do not call these growths warts; we use the more formal term: viral papilloma. As in people, viral papillomas are caused by a papillomavirus, although dogs and people have different papillomaviruses and cannot transmit their viruses across species lines. What Do These Papillomas Look Like? By far, the most common type of viral papilloma in dogs is near the mouth, caused by CPV1 (canine papillomavirus-1). Viral papillomas are classically fimbriated, meaning they are round but often have a rough, almost jagged surface reminiscent of a sea anemone or a cauliflower. They occur usually on the lips and muzzle of a young dog (usually less than 2 years of age). Less commonly, papillomas can occur on the eyelids and even the surface of the eye or between the toes. Usually, they occur in groups rather than as solitary growths so if one growth is noted, check inside the mouth and lips for more. When the viral papilloma has a classic appearance like the ones shown above, a biopsy is usually not needed to identify the growth. In cases where there is uncertainty, however, a biopsy will settle any questions. The good news is that most oral viral papilloma cases are mild and resolve on their own within 2 months. How is this Virus Transmitted? The infection is transmitted through direct contact with the papillomas on an infected dog or with the virus in the pet’s environment (on toys, bedding, food bowls, etc.). The virus requires injured skin to establish infection; healthy skin will not be infected. The incubation period is 1 to 2 months. This virus can only be spread among dogs. It is not contagious to other pet species or to humans, and it appears not to be contagious after the lesion has regressed. Recovered dogs cannot be infected with the same strain of virus but there are several viral strains. To become infected, the dog generally needs an immature immune system or a suppressed immune system, thus this infection is primarily one of young dogs and puppies.  Dogs taking cyclosporine orally to treat immune-mediated disease may also have an outbreak of papilloma lesions. The canine papillomavirus has been shown to be able to survive at least two months at temperatures of 40º F but only six hours at 98º F. Are Viral Papillomas Dangerous? Not really. They should go away on their own as the dog’s immune system matures and generates a response against the papillomavirus. The process of regression usually takes 1 to 2 months. If lesions are still there after 3 months, treatment is recommended (see below) and a biopsy may be needed to confirm that the growth really is a viral papilloma. Severe cases can actually interfere with chewing and swallowing, but such heavy involvement is unusual. Sometimes oral papillomas can become infected with bacteria from the mouth. Antibiotics will be needed in such cases to control the pain, swelling, and bad breath. Treatment In most cases, treatment is unnecessary; they simply go away on their own. Occasionally an unfortunate dog will have a huge number of papillomas, so many that consuming food becomes a problem. Papillomas can be surgically removed or frozen off cryogenically. Sometimes crushing several growths seems to stimulate the host’s immune system to assist in the tumor regression process. In humans, anti-viral doses of interferon have been used to treat severe cases of warts, and this treatment is also available for severely infected dogs though it is costly and yields inconsistent results. More recently, a topical medication called imiquimod has been used in both canine and human infections to help boost immune-mediated inflammation and thus facilitate the destruction of the virus by the body. Imiquimod is being prescribed increasingly for dogs with viral papillomas on their skin. Skin irritation is frequently noted adjacent to the growth when imiquimod is in use, but this is generally regarded as a sign that the growth is regressing and the medication is working. A research group in Turkey in 2008 reported excellent success using a 10-day course of azithromycin. Treatment was able to remove all lesions within 15 days, with no recurrences reported in the subsequent 8 months of the study. Subsequent results have been mixed; however, this therapy is frequently used in more stubborn cases as the medication is reasonably priced and readily available. Sometimes some of the warts can be removed and made into a vaccine of sorts. The vaccine helps stimulate the patient's immune system so that the virus and tumors can be made to regress naturally. Making the vaccine requires DNA from the patient's virus and can be used as either treatment or prevention. Special biologic companies use their technology to custom-make tumor vaccines in this way. For more information, visit Torigen.com Other Types of Papillomas The oral papilloma is by far the most common canine viral papilloma, but it is certainly not the only kind. There are other papillomaviruses besides CPV-1. Here are other types of viral papillomas: Cutaneous Inverted Papillomas (Also Called Endophytic Warts)These are caused by the CPV-2 papillomavirus as well as other papillomaviruses. They can appear as single nodules on the belly (1/2- 1 inch across) with a small central pore or they can be disseminated like a lumpy rash. They can also form between the dog's toes. Papillomavirus Pigmented PlaquesThese are caused by several of the "Chi canine papillomaviruses" and usually affect pugs and miniature schnauzers. They are dark, scaly, and of variable size and are usually found on the belly. Unlike other papillomas, these do not regress on their own except in pugs. They are capable of transforming into malignancy. Digital PapillomasThese are caused by the CPV-2 papillomavirus as well as other papillomaviruses and grow on the foot pads and between the toes. They tend to be painful and have the potential to transform into malignancy. These non-oral papillomas do not possess the classic fimbriated appearance of the oral papilloma and are likely to require biopsy for identification. As with oral papillomas, though, they can be expected to regress in most cases within a 2-month time frame. If they do not, the same treatments noted above can be applied.

Category: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-Like Syndrome in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called Uveodermatologic Syndrome) True VKH syndrome is a human disease, well described for nearly a century. A similar disease in dogs has been described but since we do not know the relationship between the canine and human disease, we are hesitant to call the canine version VKH syndrome as well. Until we know what is really going on in dogs, we will leave it at VKH-LIKE syndrome or, more accurately, uveodermatologic syndrome. A syndrome is a collection of symptoms. In humans, VKH syndrome consists of the following: Affected people are typically of Mediterranean, Hispanic or Asian descent. There are numerous links for more information regardingthis condition in humans. The syndrome in dogs includes: Unlike the human disease, deafness or meningitis is not a feature. The most detrimental part of the syndrome is blindness. What Causes this Syndrome? Uveodermatologic syndrome is an immune-mediated disease where the body inappropriately attacks its own melanocytes (the pigment-producing cells). These cells seem most prevalent in the skin, retina, and uveal tract of the eye. It is speculated that the immune reaction is initially triggered by a virus though research is ongoing. How is the Diagnosis Made? The best way to confirm this diagnosis is by a skin biopsy (the lip is said to be the best location). Treatment, however, is focused on the eye disease as this has the most serious outcome ‒ blindness ‒ while skin disease is generally cosmetic. Uveitis is most literally inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye. The uveal tract consists of the iris (the colored portion), the ciliary body (the area inside from which the lens is suspended), and the choroid (the vascular coating of the inside). The treatment for uveitis due to a VKH-like syndrome is the same as for other causes of uveitis. Thanks to the Animal Ophthalmology Clinic, Ltd. for these pictures. See the completecase studyof Sheila. Treatment Uveitis, whether it is caused by VKH-like immune-mediated inflammation or something else, is treated by suppressing the inflammation. This means corticosteroids (such asprednisone) are taken orally as well as topically. VKH-like syndrome will require ongoing immune suppression to prevent blindness and sincelong-term steroid useis undesirable therapy often switches toazathioprine,cyclosporine, or some other stronger immunomodulating agent. Topical therapy is also necessary; steroid-containing eye drops or injections of steroids into the conjunctival membranes are commonly used.With aggressive treatment, some dogs are able to regain some vision but in general, vision cannot be preserved and a more realistic goal is to control the eye pain. Blind dogs still have a good quality of life as long as the pain is controlled. A 2018 study published in the JAVMA by Zarfoss et. al., reviewed 50 dogs with uveodermatologic syndrome. At the initial evaluation, 36% of dogs had glaucoma (increased eye pressure) and 57% were blind in both eyes. Some dogs were able to regain vision and 50% of subjects could see in at least one eye at the end of the study. Of the dogs that ultimately became blind in both eyes, blindness came on over 13.5 months (median). At least 10 eyes had to be removed in order to provide long-term comfort.

Category: What To Do When Your Dog’s Toenail Trims Don’t Go as  Planned
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  When your dog’s nails get too long, it can affect their health and overall comfort. Overgrown nails are more prone to nail breakage and injury. Over time, too-long nails can keep your dog from placing their feet correctly as they walk or run, and broken nails can get snagged in carpet. You’ve watched the staff at your veterinarian's office trim your dog’s (or cat’s) nails many times. Your well-trained dog has no problem with nail clippers and is always cooperative with the technicians, so how hard can this be? If you aren’t planning to visit the veterinarian for any other reason, you think, why go in just for a quick nail trim? So, you have corralled the needed tools for the job, which in your mind are: 1.  your dog; and2.  the nail clippers. As expected, your always-calm dog sniffs the clippers and holds their paw up for you to begin. Clearly, this is not a big deal. You grasp the paw in your hand and gently expose the first toenail by squeezing a bit. You put the trimmer around the nail and squeeze the handles. With a satisfying click, you see the nail trimming pop away, and at the very same moment, your sweet dog lets out a sharp yelp, frightening you both. And there is blood. Blood? Why is there blood? That never happens when the veterinarian technician does the nail trimming. Your very good dog is still sitting there, looking at you with what you think is betrayed reproach. What now? Panic? No. Nail Trim Essentials Let’s back up. Let’s return to the last time the veterinary technician trimmed your dog’s nails. This time, really watch the process and ask questions, such as, how short should you trim the nails? If you aren’t familiar with the term “quick”, it refers to the blood and nerve-filled nail bed. If nails are clipped too short, the quick is nicked, and the nail will bleed. If your dog has fairly clear nails, you can see the quick. If there is an assortment of clear and dark nails, you can judge where the quick might be on the dark ones by looking at a clear nail. There is a theory that when nails are trimmed or broken, the quick recedes further up the nail. Therefore the“quick line” may not be the same on every nail. If your dog or cat has a nail that seems ragged or shorter than the rest or has a bit of dried blood on it, this nail may have been torn previously. Keep in mind that this nail may not need as much trimming as the longer ones. However, it’s a good idea to clean it up to avoid further tearing. So, you feel more confident trimming your dog or cat’s nails, right? Handling “Quicked” Nails: But now you know that things can happen, and you have revised your list of tools. You gather: Over-the-counter coagulants to stop nail bleeding are readily available. Styptic powder is the most common substance used for this type of first aid. Made from natural ingredients, including potassium aluminum sulfate (alum) and diatomaceous earth, styptic powder can be used on minor cuts and toenails. It’s safe for use on pets. You can find styptic powder at any pet supply store. Your veterinarian probably carries it if the clinic sells over-the-counter products. Corn starch will also stop bleeding effectively, and baking powder or flour can be used as a second choice. Keep styptic powder or one of these products on hand with your nail-clipping supplies. If a toenail does start to bleed, press the clean towel against the nail and hold it firmly for a few moments. Remove the towel and press the bleeding nail into some coagulant powder you’ve already prepared by pouring it onto the paper towel or dish. Use your fingers to pinch some powder to pack into the nail. Continue to hold the towel firmly around the toe. You could also use a cotton-tipped applicator with styptic powder on the end and hold that firmly to the toenail. A few minutes of this will likely stop the bleeding, but if it doesn’t, continue the pressure with the towel and reapply the styptic powder. If your pet isn’t exactly the quiet dog described here, have someone help you by holding your dog or cat. A trusted pet holder can help calm an upset animal and keep the affected foot still, helping to avoid a mess if your pet flings their paw around. Make sure you have trained your pet prior to beginning nail trims.Food distractionsmay also be helpful. While uncomfortable for your pet, a toenail trimmed too short and bleeding is not necessarily an emergency. You will become more confident trimming your pet’s nails and less likely to nip the quick the more times you do it. If the bleeding continues for longer than 10 minutes or is very heavy, call your veterinarian. On rare occasions, your dog may need to be seen by a veterinarian to assess why a nail is bleeding excessively, and sometimes an injured or broken toenail must be removed in order to heal properly.

Category: AAFCO Pet Food Labeling
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pet food marketing can get confusing. The labeling does not provide detailed nutritional information and it’s easily misunderstood by consumers. Try as you might, sometimes reading the label doesn’t give you enough answers. However, the more you know about what pet food labels indicate – and don’t – the better off your pet will be. What is AAFCO? AAFCOis the go-to organization for understanding animal feed, including food for pets. It does not regulate or inspect anything, nor is it a government agency. It is a group whose members are government agencies representing the 50 states, Canada, and the federal government. It is not a regulatory body and has no ability to monitor or enforce specific food manufacturing procedures. Animal feed specialists indicate to them what is appropriate for a specific species, and AAFCO provides model feed laws. AAFCO does not approve or certify any pet food, treat, or supplement products. The FDA, not AAFCO, regulates pet food, and FDA is a member of AAFCO. State feed control officials can choose to adopt these model feed laws – if they do, then monitoring and enforcement duties are the responsibility of the individual state. Pet food manufacturers that sell food must comply with all relevant federal or state laws. Most pet foods sold in multiple states will comply with the AAFCO guidelines. AAFCO relies on current scientific knowledge to provide guidelines for pet food composition which, if followed,minimize the risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, the FDA enforces food safety through the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, which demands that pet foods, like human foods, be “pure and wholesome, safe to eat, produced under sanitary conditions, contain no harmful substances, and be truthfully labeled.” Therefore, pet food manufacturers are legally responsible for providing nutritionally adequate, safe, and wholesome products that conform to local, state, and federal law. AAFCO requires nine components to be printed on a pet food label:  What are the different AAFCO nutritional adequacy designations for pet foods? There are four possible AAFCO nutritional adequacy statements that can appear on pet food labels. These must be printed verbatim as one of the following: How are AAFCO feeding trials conducted? The guidelines for an AAFCO feeding trial vary depending on the diet type being evaluated. There are four protocols: maintenance, growth, gestation/lactation, and all life stages. Although the minimum standards for each type of trial must be met, companies may add on other components to a feeding trial, such as plasma amino acid measurement, digestibility studies, full blood chemistry panels, and complete blood counts to gain additional information about the suitability of their diets for the life stage being tested. Foods can be put through AAFCO feeding trials even if they do not qualify for a “formulated to meet AAFCO” feeding statement due to deficient or excessive levels of nutrients. One example is veterinary therapeutic diets formulated for chronic kidney disease, which are intentionally formulated to contain phosphorus (+/- protein) at concentrations below the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles for adult maintenance; many of these have passed maintenance feeding trials and thus have a “feeding trial” nutritional adequacy statement on the bag. If they have not undergone feeding trials, they must carry the statement: “This product is intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.” Such diets are not allowed to reference the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles on the label. Theoretically, the flip side is that diets that fail feeding trials but contain nutrient levels within the specified minimum and maximum concentrations per AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles can be marketed with a “formulated to meet” adequacy statement. Ideally, diets are formulated to comply with the concentrations specified by the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles and then pass appropriate feeding trials. Foradult maintenance canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Forgrowth canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Forreproduction canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Do AAFCO feeding trials accomplish what they claim to accomplish? Many pet owners and clinicians have raised the concern that AAFCO feeding trials do not represent what really happens in a pet’s life, i.e., that feeding a diet for six months is not the same as feeding a diet for 10 years. That is true. However, although AAFCO trials are imperfect, they do identify most serious acute and semi-acute nutritional deficiencies or excesses, and some minor ones. Furthermore, manufacturers are free to supplement the minimum protocol requirements with additional measures of nutritional adequacy. Also, consider that diets for growth, gestation/lactation, or all life stages get tested more rigorously compared to maintenance since the nutritional demands of those animals are greater. Evaluation of diets under AAFCO guidelines also includes an examination of the nutrient content of the diet being tested. The nutrient content can be determined either by testing a sample of the finished diet or by using the nutrient content of the individual ingredients in the food to calculate the diet composition. The latter is less desirable, since ingredients are naturally variable in nutrient content and because processing and nutrient interactions could alter bioavailability (how much can actually be absorbed and used by your pet's body) in the final diet. There is no requirement for either in vivo or laboratory testing of pet food products if the formulation method of substantiating nutritional adequacy is used. Some companies have performed other in vivo testing (in-vivo meaning taking place within a living thing) and even lifelong feeding trials to demonstrate that their diets provide complete and balanced nutrition for the expected feeding duration (i.e., “for life”). How can you identify the pet foods that have undergone “more rigorous” testing of their pet food, rather than just the AAFCO statement on the bag? Unfortunately, you can't. Even veterinarians can’t. The pet food label is really a legal document and is not designed to convey significant nutritional information. As much as some sources (such as internet ranking lists) would like it to be possible, you cannot evaluate 'quality' from the label, especially from ingredient lists. You need to consider the manufacturer (reputation, experience, investment in AAFCO trials and research, etc.), cost, availability, and how your pets are doing on various diets. Board-certified veterinary nutritionists in clinical practice are alerted to dietary issues with specific diets because of extensive interaction with clients, practitioners, and each other. Therefore, these specialists are often a reliable resource for determining which diets are causing disease problems. In addition, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Nutrition Toolkit developed by the WSAVA Global Nutrition Committee provides many useful nutrition resources includingRecommendations on Selecting Pet Foods. This document lists eight questions to help owners assess pet foods: Factors to consider about a brand: Things to look for on a pet food label: It is ideal for a manufacturer to have a qualified nutritionist as a full-time employee rather than just as a consultant. Dr. Cailin Heinze, a board-certified nutritionist, additionally prefers companies that perform testing above and beyond AAFCO trials, especially with veterinary therapeutic diets. Furthermore, Dr. Heinze looks for company longevity as a sign of a successful track record and is critical of “guerrilla marketing” in pet supply stores (aggressive, emotion-based strategies directly to consumers). Finally, she looks for companies willing to share full nutritional profiles (e.g. full or typical analysis) of their diets rather than just a guaranteed analysis, and provide updated information with regular batch testing. Understanding what’s best for your pet isn’t always easy. Oftentimes the only way to get a clear answer to your question is to telephone (not email) the manufacturer. However, the best chance for your pet’s good health is to begin with food bearing an AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement on its label.

Category: Acute Hemorrhagic Diarrhea Syndrome (AHDS or HGE)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The term hemorrhagic gastroenteritis basically means stomach and intestine inflammation with bleeding. This kind of bleeding inflammation might be seen in patients withparvovirusinfection,pancreatitis,inflammatory bowel disease,or any number of other conditions but when the term HGE is used, it usually refers to a more specific canine syndrome and is an entity in and of itself. To clarify terminology, HGE has been renamed AHDS, which stands for acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome. Because this change in nomenclature is recent, you may hear veterinary personnel using either term, but regardless they are referring to the specific syndrome that we will now describe. Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome is a potentially life-threatening intestinal condition of an otherwise healthy dog, which manifests as sudden onset bloody, watery diarrhea. The symptoms are extremely dehydrating, often much more than expected from the amount of diarrhea, and if it is not promptly treated, the dog can go into shock and die. Vomiting is often part of the syndrome. In fact, 80% of patients experience vomiting approximately 10 hours before the dramatic bloody diarrhea, and about half the time, vomiting contains obvious blood. The good news is that with hospitalization and treatment, most dogs recover rapidly. It is crucial to identify AHDS and rule out other serious conditions promptly so that the dog can get the correct treatment and the pet's family can have proper expectations. Smaller dog breeds seem to have a predisposition towards AHDS though any dog can be affected.  Stress and hyperactivity seem to be predisposing factors. How is this Condition Diagnosed? There are no specific tests for AHDS, but a test called a packed cell volume (also called PCV or hematocrit) helps make the diagnosis. This test can be performed in most veterinary hospitals using a few drops of blood. The percentage of the blood volume made up of red blood cells is measured. A normal PCV for a healthy dog would be 37-55%, meaning 37-55% of the blood volume should be red blood cells; the rest is fluid and white blood cells. When the patient becomes really dehydrated, there is less fluid in the bloodstream, and the percentage of blood fluid drops (and consequently, the percentage of red blood cells rises). In other words, the seriously dehydrated patient has a very high PCV. The average AHDS patient will have a PCV of at least 57%. (It will even be greater than 60% in approximately 30% of patients.) The measurement of the PCV also usually includes some sort of measurement of total protein (sometimes called total solids). In AHDS, the total protein measurement from the blood sample is paradoxically normal or low. There are several aspects to the AHDS syndrome, and they do not all have to be there to make the diagnosis. The syndrome elements your veterinarian will be looking for are: As noted, there are many causes of bloody diarrhea like this, including an intestinal foreign body that requires surgery. Expect your veterinarian to need other tests to rule out other potentially more serious conditions. What Causes AHDS? There are still many unknown factors, but the cause appears to begin with infection from an intestinal bacterium calledClostridium perfringensType A. A PCR test forClostridium perfringensType Acan be used to determine for sure. This organism produces two toxins called NET E and NET F, which are different from the usual Clostridial enterotoxin that is well known to cause diarrhea. The toxin ulcerates the intestinal lining, and the intestinal blood vessels become permeable to fluid. In this way, fluid is lost into the intestine, dehydrating the patient, and the PCV rises while the ulcers are responsible for the bleeding. Treating AHDS The heart of therapy is aggressive fluid replacement. The idea is to get the PCV back to the normal range and keep the patient out of shock. Medication for nausea and pain control are included as is a low-fat diet as soon as the patient is willing to eat. As dramatic as the diarrhea is, most patients have an equally dramatic improvement in the first 24 hours of hospitalization and the average dog is out of the hospital after three days total. Antibiotics are surprisingly controversial in this syndrome, and their use depends on many patient factors (such as whether or not there is a fever, white blood cell count, whether or not the expected improvement is achieved, etc). The stool can be expected to gradually return to normal over about one week. Probiotics (cultures of healthy bacteria) have been recommended to help repopulate the bowel, with "good" bacteria which improves the function of the intestines. They may be recommended for 2-4 weeks, and your veterinarian will let you know how long to give probiotics.

Category: Anal Sac Tumors in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   If your dog has ever scooted their rear end across your carpet, they were probably trying toempty their anal sacs. Humans don’t have anal sacs that are similar to our pets, but dogs and cats, along with many other animals do.  A few pets may develop issues with these sacs, so, what are they? Anal sacs, also called anal glands, are small balloon-like structures filled with a brown liquid known for its repulsively metallic, fishy smell. Dogs have two anal glands that sit just inside their anus at the 4 and 8 o’clock positions. When the dog defecates, some of the stinky fluid in these sacs is squeezed out with the feces. This liquid may play a role in territorial marking and communication among dogs. What Are Anal Sac Tumors? Many problems can affect a dog’s anal sacs, including tumors. Some cancerous anal sac tumors, known as anal sac adenocarcinomas or apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinomas are abnormal, malignant growths of the anal sac. They are uncommon but serious and can affect any dog but older dogs. Certain breeds such as Spaniels, German Shepherds, and dachshunds are at higher risk. There are also benign forms of anal sac tumors (not malignant) called perianal gland adenomas. Overall, anal sac tumors can bring illness, discomfort, and a decreased quality of life to your dog. Thus, it is essential to catch these tumors early, determine what type of tumor they are, and treat them as soon as possible. What Causes Anal Sac Tumors? As with most cancers, a cause has not been identified. However, genetics and environmental factors likely play important roles. Although we can’t pinpoint a cause, we do have some understanding of what’s happening at a microscopic level. Cells in the anal sac start dividing and multiplying in an uncontrolled manner. This cell division creates a mass that makes the anal sac larger, but this alone usually doesn’t cause issues, at least until the mass gets quite large. The larger concern (with adenocarcinomas) is when cancer cells break away and travel to other parts of the body to make new tumors.  These malignant cells often spread to lymph nodes, which are small lumps of immune tissue scattered throughout the body. They can also spread to essential organs, such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Another problem with anal sac tumors is that they sometimes increase the amount of calcium in the blood.High calcium levelscan damage the kidneys, which are the organs that filter blood and make urine. High calcium levels can also disrupt the function of the nervous system, intestines, and heart. As you might imagine, this disruption can cause a range of symptoms and issues for your dog. What Are The Signs of Anal Sac Tumors? It depends on the behavior of the tumor and if and to where it has spread. Many dogs won’t show any signs. However, when the tumor spreads to nearby lymph nodes or the mass gets large, your dog may strain and struggle to defecate or not even defecate at all. They can also have ribbon-like stools and some swelling in the back legs. If the tumor increases blood calcium levels, your dog may drink and pee more, eat less, vomit, and seem weak and tired. Other possible signs include: Dogs with anal sac tumors may also scoot, meaning they sit and drag their rear end against the ground. However, scooting much more commonly indicates full or inflamed anal glands that need to be expressed (squeezed) by your veterinarian, rather than cancer. How Are Anal Sac Tumors Diagnosed? Your veterinarian will talk to you about the history of your dog’s problem as well as perform a physical exam. As part of this, they may conduct a rectal exam to feel for the tumor. During this procedure, they will stick a gloved finger through your dog’s anus into the rectum. If they feel or see a growth, they might do a fine needle aspiration of the mass. This means they will poke the mass with a needle, suck out some of the cells, put them on a glass slide, and send it to a lab for evaluation. This information will help narrow down what the mass is. If these results are suspicious of cancer, your veterinarian will likely surgically remove the mass and send it to a lab to confirm it is cancer. Your veterinarian will also do additional tests to see if and where the tumor has spread and if it has affected the body in other ways. For example, your veterinarian may do blood and urine tests, to check for high blood calcium and kidney damage, as well as chest X-rays and abdominal ultrasound to see if the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes and organs, such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys. How Are Anal Sac Tumors Treated? Until more serious treatment can be pursued, your veterinarian may recommend stool softeners to make it easier for your dog to defecate and give fluids and medications. They may also refer you to a veterinary surgeon more well-versed in treating these serious tumors. Surgery If it is possible, surgical removal of the mass and any enlarged lymph nodes in the area is the main way to treat anal gland adenocarcinomas (malignant). Surgery has been shown to lengthen the survival time of dogs with anal sac adenocarcinomas. However, tumors may eventually reappear if cancer cells are left behind and the cancer cells may have already spread to other sites at the time of removal. With perianal gland adenomas (benign), surgery usually cures the disease, but regrowth can occur in some dogs over time. After surgery, some dogs won’t be able to control their bowel movements for a while and there is an infection risk at the surgical site, especially if it is near the route feces take out of the body. Chemotherapy and Radiation - Malignant Tumors Because malignant anal sac tumors have such a high risk of spread, chemotherapy is often recommended after surgery. It involves giving medications, often via the mouth or blood, to kill or inhibit cancer cells throughout the body. Radiation therapy may also be recommended after or instead of surgery if surgery isn’t possible. It involves using radiation to destroy cancer cells. It is only offered at certain facilities, such as veterinary schools and some specialty practices, due to the expense of the equipment. Some people travel significant distances to get radiation services. Both chemotherapy and radiation therapy can have serious side effects that your veterinarian will discuss with you. What is the Prognosis (Outlook) for Malignant Anal Sac Tumors? Survival times for dogs with anal sac tumors are variable but on average range from about 1-2 years. However, every dog’s situation is different because the prognosis depends on many factors such as: Dogs who receive surgery or any type of treatment generally have a better prognosis whereas the outlook is often less promising for dogs with larger tumors, high blood calcium levels, and extensive spread of the tumor. How Can I Prevent Anal Sac Tumors? There’s no proven way to prevent anal sac tumors from developing. Early detection is important and may be achieved through routine rectal exams performed by your veterinarian. Sometimes anal sac tumors are an incidental finding during a seemingly healthy pet’s physical exam. Maintaining a regular exam schedule as recommended by your veterinarian can help screen for anal sac and other abnormalities, hopefully keeping your dog as healthy and happy as possible.

Category: Bacterial Diarrheas in Puppies & Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bacterial diarrheas are generally a nuisance for the adult animal but can be lethal to a small puppy, kitten, or even a human baby. Most of these problems stem from contaminated food or fecal contaminated environment.Feeding raw food dietsto pets dramatically increases the exposure to infectious organisms to the humans in the family. Since these conditions are also human diseases, it is helpful to have some understanding of what they are, even if there are no young pets or immune-suppressed individuals (human or otherwise) at home. Campylobacter Campylobacterspecies are a group of bacteria capable of causing diarrhea in dogs, cats, humans, and other animals. They have a unique curved appearance under the microscope and are said to be sea gull-shaped.  They are difficult to isolate as they grow in conditions of low oxygen (making them microaerophilic as opposed to being aerobic or anaerobic bacteria). With regard to pets,Campylobacterare generally a problem for the very young. Puppies and kittens have not yet matured immunologically. Plus, because they are small, fluid loss from diarrhea hits them much harder. Furthermore, puppies and kittens are more likely to be housed in groups where fecal cross-contamination is common so they may be more likely to become infected than adult animals. Adult animals commonly haveCampylobacterorganisms living in their intestines, but they do not experience any sickness due to it. In humans,Campylobacterinfection is a leading cause of gastrointestinal (GI) disease; infected dogs and cats can carry the organism and spread it even if they do not have symptoms themselves.  For this reason, pets used for therapy in assisted living communities and similar situations should be screened forCampylobacterby fecal culture before exposure to people with suppressed immunity. Humans are also infected by consumption of contaminated food, water, or raw milk; only 6% of humanCampylobacterinfections are attributed to dog exposure.  That said, exposure to a dog with diarrhea triples a person’s risk for developing enteritis fromCampylobacterjejuniorCampylobacter coli. Studies screening pet animals for inapparentCampylobacterinfections have found surprisingly high incidences of inapparent infection. In one study in the Midwest, 24% of 152 healthy cats were positive, for example. After consuming Campylobacter organisms, they travel to the lower small intestine, attach, and multiply. They produce a toxin that destroys the lining of the intestine with the result being a bloody, mucous diarrhea (though occasionally a more watery diarrhea is described).  Sometimes a fever results, appetite becomes poor, and vomiting can occur.  Incubation is 2 to 5 days.  The organism can survive as long as a month in environmental feces. Diagnosis is made by seeing the sea gull-shaped organisms under the microscope; however, there are so many bacterial organisms on a fecal sample that finding the culprit can be tricky. For this reason, a culture is often performed as a more accurate test. Because the organism is microaerophilic, specific culture requirements must be met; the facilities of a reference laboratory are needed. Treatment is with appropriate antibiotics, such aserythromycin,chloramphenicolortylosin. Salmonella Most people are somewhat familiar withSalmonella.They know it represents a type of food poisoning, probably know it is associated with diarrhea that can be severe, and may even know thatSalmonellaspecies are bacteria. Most human cases ofSalmonellainfection cause fever, diarrhea, and cramping that go away on their own, but in children, it can produce more severe disease. As withCampylobacter, the young are more susceptible to more severe illness because they are smaller and do not have mature immunity.  The same is true with puppies and kittens; adult animals are almost never affected bySalmonellainfection. An important exception to the "Salmonella is rare in adult dogs" rule is the case of dogs fed a raw food diet. It has become popular to feed raw foods to pets with the idea that a raw food diet more closely approximates the natural diet that the feline or canine body evolved to consume, and thus, such a diet should be healthier than commercially prepared foods. In fact, cooking food is central to removing parasites, bacteria, and bacterial toxins from food. A recent study evaluating raw food diets found that 80% of food samples containedSalmonellabacteria and that 30% of the dogs in the study were sheddingSalmonellabacteria in their stool. Adult dogs are often asymptomatic, but any infected animal or person will shed the organism for at least six weeks, thus acting as a source of exposure to other animals or people.Salmonellaorganisms are difficult to remove from the environment and easily survive three months in soil. Again, dogs used for therapy around the elderly or children should be cultured forSalmonella. There are two syndromes associated withSalmonella:diarrhea and sepsis.Salmonellabacteria, once consumed, attach to the intestine and secrete toxins. The toxins produce diarrhea that can be severe and even life-threatening in the young. If this were not bad enough, someSalmonellacan produce an even more serious “part two" (sepsis) should these bacteria invade the body through the damaged intestine, causing a more widespread and much more serious infection. In young animals, the syndrome resulting is similar to that of canineparvovirusthus similar treatment is expected. E. Coli Escherichia colimay be the most common bacterial organism in the world. It lives in our intestines naturally and covers the world we live in. Unfortunately, some strains ofE. coliare not so neighborly and are capable of producing diarrhea via toxin production. Like the other organisms we have discussed, this is a serious problem for the very young and more of a nuisance for adults.  There are three main types of unfriendlyE. coli:EnterotoxicE. coli, enterohemorrhagicE. coli,andenteropathogenicE. coli. EnterotoxigenicE. coliis a common cause of diarrhea in young animals as well as human infants and is responsible for the famous traveler’s diarrhea. These bacteria produce what is called an enterotoxin in the upper small intestine. This toxin, similar to the toxin of cholera, causes the intestine cells to secrete the body's fluid into the intestine, creating spectacular watery diarrhea and what can be life-threatening dehydration for smaller living creatures.  Young pigs, cattle, and other livestock are commonly lost to this kind of dehydration. Again, the younger and smaller the patient is, the more serious this infection is. EnteropathogenicE. colialso produce diarrhea in humans and animals. Rather than a secretory diarrhea as above, they simply destroy the intestinal cells where they attach. Diarrhea still results, but it creates more damage to the intestinal lining. EnterohemorrhagicE. coliis similar to enteropathogenicE. colibut with more associated inflammation. This type does not seem to be a problem for small animals though they can carry it asymptomatically. It would seem that antibiotics would be the obvious treatment for a bacterial disease, yet forE. coliit is surprisingly controversial. It seems that the use of antibiotics can enhance the synthesis of toxins by these bacteria; plus, oftentimes, antibiotic use only serves to makeE. colimore resistant in the GI tract. Antibiotics are generally reserved for those animals (or people) who seem the most sick or who have evidence of bacterial invasion in the bloodstream. Basically, treatment is supportive care until the patient's immune system regains the upper hand. In Conclusion Bacterial diarrheas are an especially serious consideration in the very young and in the weak or compromised, be they human or non-human. It is not unusual for apparently healthy animals to carry these organisms and shed them into the environment and feeding raw foods greatly increases the risk of this kind of latent infection. If you are considering raw food diets, especially if someone in the home is very young or has a compromised immunity, discuss prevention of these infections with your veterinarian.

Category: Bloat - The Mother of All Emergencies
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many injuries and physical disorders represent life-threatening emergencies, but there is only one condition so drastic that it overshadows them all in terms of rapidity of consequences and effort in emergency treatment: the gastric dilatation and volvulus – the bloat. What is it, and Why Is It So Serious? The normal stomach sits high in the abdomen and contains a small amount of gas, some mucus, and any food being digested. It undergoes a normal rhythm of contraction, receiving food from the esophagus above, grinding the food, and moving the ground food out to the small intestine at its other end. Normally, this proceeds uneventfully except for the occasional burp. In the bloated stomach, gas and/or food stretches the stomach many times its normal size, causing tremendous abdominal pain. For reasons we do not fully understand, this grossly distended stomach tends to rotate, thus twisting off not only its own blood supply but the only exit routes for the gas inside. The spleen, which normally nestles along the greater curvature of the stomach, can twist as well, cutting off its circulation. The distended stomach becomes so large that it compresses the large veins that run along the back, returning the body's blood to the heart, creating a circulatory shock. Not only is this collection of disasters extremely painful, but it is also rapidly life-threatening. A dog with a bloated, twisted stomach (more scientifically called gastric dilatation and volvulus) will die in pain in a matter of hours unless drastic steps are taken. What Are the Risk Factors for Developing Bloat? Dogs weighing more than 99 pounds have an approximate 20 percent risk of bloat.The risk of bloating increases with age. Classically, this condition affects dog breeds that are said to be deep-chested, meaning the length of their chest from backbone to sternum is relatively long while the chest width from right to left is narrow. Examples of deep-chested breeds would be the Great Dane, Greyhound, and the setter breeds. Still, any dog can bloat, even dachshunds and chihuahuas. Classically, the bloated dog has recently eaten a large meal and exercised heavily shortly thereafter. Still, we usually do not know why a given dog bloats on an individual basis. No specific diet or dietary ingredient has been proven to be associated with bloat. Some factors found to increase and decrease the risk of bloat are listed below: Summary of Factors Increasing the Risk of Bloat Factors that May Decrease the Risk of Bloat Contrary to popular belief, cereal ingredients such as soy, wheat, or corn in the first four ingredients of the ingredient list do not increase the risk of bloat. In a study done by the Purdue University Research Group, headed by Dr. Lawrence T. Glickman: In the 1993 study from Germany (see below), the German shepherd dog and the boxer had the highest risk for bloat. How to Tell if Your Dog Has Bloated Classically, the dog is distressed and makes multiple attempts to vomit, and the upper abdomen is hard and distended from the gas within, though in a well-muscled or overweight dog, the distention may not be obvious. There are other potential emergencies (sudden abdominal bleeding from a ruptured tumor, for example) that might have a similar presentation, so radiographs may be needed to determine what has happened. The hallmark presentation of bloat is a sudden onset of abdominal distention, distress, anxiety, and pain (panting, guarding the belly, anguished facial expression), and multiple attempts at vomiting that are frequently unproductive. Not every dog will have a classic appearance, and some dogs will not have obvious abdominal distention because of their body configuration. If you are not sure, it is best to err on the side of caution and rush your dog to the veterinarianimmediately. What Has To Be Done There are several steps to saving a bloated dog’s life. Part of the problem is that all steps should be done at the same time and as quickly as possible. First: The Stomach Must be DecompressedThe huge stomach is by now pressing on the major blood vessels, carrying blood back to the heart. This stops normal circulation and sends the dog into shock. Making matters worse, the stomach tissue is dying because it is stretched too tightly to allow blood circulation through it. There can be no recovery until the stomach is untwisted and the gas is released. A stomach tube and stomach pump are generally used for this, but sometime surgery is needed to achieve stomach decompression. Also First: Rapid IV Fluids Must be Given to Reverse the ShockIntravenous catheters are placed, and life-giving fluid solutions are rushed in to replace the blood that cannot get past the bloated stomach to return to the heart. The intense pain associated with this disease causes the heart rate to race at such a high rate that heart failure will result. Medication to resolve the pain is needed if the patient’s heart rate is to slow down. Medication for shock, antibiotics, and electrolytes are all vital in stabilizing the patient. Also First: The Heart Rhythm is Assessed and StabilizedA special and very dangerous rhythm problem called a premature ventricular contraction, or "PVC," is associated with bloat and it must be ruled out. If this is the case, intravenous medications are needed to stabilize the rhythm. Since this rhythm problem may not be evident until even the next day, continual EKG monitoring may be necessary. If the disturbed heart rhythm is noted at the very beginning of treatment, this is associated with a 38% mortality rate. Getting the bloated dog's stomach decompressed and reversing the shock is an adventure in itself, but the work is not yet half finished. Surgery All bloated dogs, once stable, should have surgery. Without surgery, the damage done inside cannot be assessed or repaired, plus bloat may recur at any point, even within the next few hours, and the above adventure must be repeated. If the stomach has not untwisted with decompression, the surgeon untwists it and determines what tissue is viable and what is not. If there is a section of dying tissue on the stomach wall, this must be discovered and removed, or the dog will die despite the heroics described above. Also, the spleen, which is located adjacent to the stomach, may twist with the stomach, necessitating removal of the spleen or part of the spleen as well. After the nonviable tissue is removed, a surgery called a gastropexy is done to tack the stomach into its normal position to prevent future twisting. If the tissue damage is so bad that part of the stomach must be removed, the mortality rate jumps to 28 - 38 percent. If the tissue damage is so bad that the spleen must be removed, the mortality rate is 32 - 38 percent. After the expense and effort of the stomach decompression, it is tempting to forgo the further expense of surgery. However, consider that the next time your dog bloats, you may not be there to catch it in time and, according the study described below, without surgery, there is a 24 percent mortality rate and a 76 percent chance of re-bloating at some point. The best choice is to finish the treatment that has been started and have the abdomen explored. If the stomach can be surgically tacked into place, the recurrence rate drops to 6 percent. Surgery will prevent the stomach from twisting in the future, but the stomach is still able to periodically distend with gas. This is uncomfortable but not life-threatening. Results of a Statistical Study In 1993, a study involving 134 dogs with gastric dilatation and volvulus was conducted by the School of Veterinary Medicine in Hanover, Germany. Out of 134 dogs that came into the hospital with this condition: (Meyer-Lindenberg A., Harder A., Fehr M., Luerssen D., Brunnberg L. Treatment of gastric dilatation-volvulus and a rapid method for prevention of relapse in dogs: 134 cases (1988-1991) Journal of the AVMA, Vol 23, No 9, Nov 1, 1993, 1301-1307.) Another study published in December of 2006 looked at 166 dogs that received surgery for gastric dilatation and volvulus. The point of the study was to identify factors that led to poor prognosis. (Beck, J.J., Staatz, A.J., Pelsue, D.H., Kudnig, S.T., MacPhail, C.M., Seim H.B, and Monnet, E. Risk factors associated with short-term outcome and development of perioperative complications in dogs undergoing surgery because of gastric dilatation-volvulus: 166 cases (1992-2003). Journal of the AVMA, Vol 229, No 12, December 15, 2006, p 1934-1939.) It is crucially important that the owners of big dogs be aware of this condition and prepared for it. Know where to take your dog during overnight or Sunday hours for emergency care. Avoid exercising your dog after a large meal. Know what to watch for. Enjoy the special friendship a large dog provides, but at the same time, be aware of the large dog's special needs and concerns. Prevention: Gastropexy Surgery Preventive gastropexyis an elective surgery usually done at the time of spaying or neuter in a breed considered at risk. The gastropexy, as mentioned, tacks the stomach to the body wall, which drastically reduces the stomach's ability to twist. The stomach may distend with gas in an attempt to bloat, but since twisting is not possible, this becomes a painful and uncomfortable situation but nothing more serious than that. That said, gastropexy is not an absolute guarantee against twisting but we are talking about a recurrence rate of 76% without gastropexy versus 6% recurrence with gastropexy.  A study by Ward, Patonek, and Glickman reviewed the benefit of prophylactic surgery for bloat. The lifetime risk of death from bloat was calculated, along with estimated treatment for bloat versus the cost of prophylactic gastropexy. Prophylactic gastropexy was found to make sense for at-risk breeds, especially the Great Dane, which is at the highest risk for bloat.

Category: Clostridium perfringens Causes Diarrhea in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When pets get chronic diarrhea, one of the tests that sooner or later comes up is forClostridium perfringens.This bacterium produces an unpleasant toxin. The situation sounds simple: a pet gets infected with toxin-forming bacteria, gets diarrhea, and the diarrhea should at least improve when toxin-forming bacteria are removed. As with most things, the situation turns out to be more complicated. What isClostridium perfringens? Clostridial diseases are classic in medicine, both veterinary and human. It is aClostridiumthat causes tetanus and botulism, and clostridia are responsible for gangrene, “black leg,” lamb dysentery, and other famous maladies. Clostridia have several features in common that make them especially nefarious but most importantly: Clostridium perfringensis one of the brothers of the evilClostridiumfamily but is further classified into five biotypes (A, B, C, D and E) depending on what combination of four toxins it produces. Dogs are almost exclusively infected with biotype A. The toxins of significance that it can produce are called enterotoxins. We are particularly concerned about the alpha, epsilon, and net E/F toxins. These toxins can be seen in normal dogs, but if they are in high enough amounts, they are associated with diarrhea. How WouldClostridium perfringensInfection Happen? In order to produce toxin(s), the organism must form a spore (sporulate). Before it can do that, it must make its way into the host's intestine from the outside world. The organism enters the body orally: in food, grooming of fur, chewing up rotten dead things, etc. When the organism arrives in the small intestine, it forms a spore and begins to produce its toxin(s). Alternatively, the organism may have been happily and innocuously living in the intestine for who knows how long when something causes it to sporulate and produce toxin. The trigger may be dietary, may be related to infection with another organism, or may even be related to medications, especially antibiotics. The type of diarrhea produced is generally a colitis, meaning the large intestine is affected. Such types of diarrhea are mucousy, possibly bloody, and associated with straining. More watery diarrhea, as comes from the small intestine, is also possible. The severity of the diarrhea can range from mild to life-threatening, depending on how much toxin is produced. The important concept is thatC. perfringenstoxin can be the cause of chronic diarrhea, or it can be a complicating factor in diarrhea caused by something else. Can we Test for Toxin-Producing Strains OfClostridium perfringens? The culture will not tell us if the strain present can produce the enterotoxin. Clearly, we need to know more than whether there are anyC. perfringens.How aboutculturing forClostridium perfringens? Again, cultures are not very helpful.Clostridium perfringenscan be cultured from the feces of 80% of dogs, whether they have diarrhea or not. Some dogs seem to be unaffected. This is where PCR testing comes in; it is a form of DNA testing whereby theC. perfringensare tested for the DNA needed to make the different enterotoxins. In this way, we can detect the genes that are capable of producing enterotoxin. Furthermore, the number of gene copies can be measured so that we can tell if there are large or small amounts of toxin genes. Large amounts of toxin genes are associated with disease, so in this way, we can tell if one of theClostridium perfringensenterotoxins is likely to be contributing to the patient's diarrhea. There is also a test for the toxin, but it is an ELISA format, which means it is either negative or positive and does not say how much or how little toxin is present. In a perfect world, this test is combined with the test for the toxin-producing genes so as to confirm that not only are there large amounts of toxin genes, but they are confirmed to be producing toxin. The severity of the diarrhea can be mild all the way to life-threatening. When Should We Treat forClostridium perfringens? Let's begin with the obvious: a pet does not need to be treated forC. perfringensunless he has diarrhea. Since 80% of dogs harborClostridium perfringenswhether they have diarrhea or not, culturingClostridium perfringensfrom a fecal sample will not be adequate for diagnosis; we have to find the toxin or, at the very least, verify the presence of significant amounts of Clostridial genes capable of producing toxin. And all this must be found in a patient that actually has diarrhea. The chances are that a fecal check for worms has been done, and a trial course of an anti-diarrheal medication has been tried. A possible next step would be a PCR panel that detects the DNA from an assortment of viruses and bacteria associated with diarrhea. Often this type of panel includes a test for Clostridial enterotoxin DNA. The laboratory will report a quantification of gene copies for CPA (the gene for the alpha toxin), CPE (the gene for the epsilon toxin), and CP net E/F (the gene for the net E/F toxin). If the number of toxin genes for any of these toxins is significant, treating with antibiotics againstClostridiumis indicated. Keep in mind that Clostridial diarrhea might be the entire problem and curative with the right antibiotic or it might be secondary to a bigger problem yet to be discovered. Treatment for significant Clostridial diarrhea thus might yield only partial results. Treating the Toxin-Positive Dog with Diarrhea Any number of antibiotics can be used to remove it. Some choices include ampicillin,amoxicillin,metronidazole,erythromycin, andtylosin. Tetracycline was formerly on the list, but it has developed too much resistance.  IfC. perfringensis responsible for the diarrhea, a response to antibiotics is generally seen in a couple of days, but the full course of medication your veterinarian prescribed should still be completed.

Category: Destructive Chewing by Puppies and Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Destructive chewing is a common problem in puppies and adult dogs. Chewing by puppies is a natural, normal behavior. Puppies chew because they’re teething, they're playing, they're learning about their environment, they’re trying to escape from their kennel, etc. One of the main ways puppies learn about their world is to put things in their mouths and chew on them. It is unlikely that you will be able to stop normal chewing behavior completely in puppies. Trying to stop a normal but unwanted behavior can cause stress and anxiety, and lead to more serious behavior problems. Teething occurs in puppies up to eight months of age. That means chewing problems can be worse in younger animals than in older ones. Adult dogs may be destructive chewers because they have separation anxiety, they're playing, they’re hungry, they don’t get enough exercise, they weren’t properly trained as puppies, etc. How can you minimize the damage to your home and household? The basic methods are to keep your puppy/dog busy, prevent access to things that you don't want damaged, and provide your pet with acceptable things to chew. Destructive behaviors (chewing, barking, digging, etc.) are not only damaging to your home and possessions, but they can also lead to injury to your dog. Plus, they are a major reason dogs are taken to animal shelters and humane societies. With a little time and work, you and your dog should be able to have a good life together and could avoid being part of those statistics.

Category: Elevated Liver Enzymes in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English My veterinarian ran some blood tests and said my dog's liver enzymes were elevated. What does that mean? Your veterinarian may recommend doing blood tests for a variety of reasons, such as an annual wellness screening, prior to scheduling anesthesia or starting certain medications, or because your dog is acting sick. How the liver enzymes are interpreted depends upon the age and breed of your dog, history of certain medications, what (if any) clinical signs your dog has, as well as the specific lab results. A lot of times, the increase in liver enzymes is mild and self-limiting; rarely, it can indicate a serious underlying liver disease. Which of the lab values are the liver enzymes? The main liver enzymes that your veterinarian may look at include the ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase). Liver enzymes can be elevated from liver disease or can be secondarily affected by other diseases or processes outside the liver, e.g.,pancreatitis(inflammation of the pancreas), intestinal disease, or certain hormonal diseases such asdiabetesorCushing'sdisease (overactive adrenal gland(s) producing too much cortisol). Certain medications, such assteroids(even in eye or ear medications) orphenobarbital(an antiseizure drug), can also cause elevations in liver enzymes. Why are age and breed important? Puppies will normally have anelevated ALPbecause ALP also comes from growing bones, not just liver cells. Some older dogs will have a benign accumulation of water, carbohydrates, or fat in the liver cells (so-called vacuolar hepatopathy). Others can develop nodules as an aging change. These diseases typically primarily cause an elevated ALP and do not really affect liver function or require treatment. Elevations in ALT and ALP do not necessarily mean the liver is failing or not working properly. However, your veterinarian may recommend another blood test, called bile acids, to assess liver function. Another test that can be used to assess how the liver is working is bilirubin. This is the yellow pigment that builds up in the body when an animal is jaundiced. If the bilirubin is increased, this already indicates decreased liver function (unless the patient is also severely anemic), so bile acid testing in this situation is not indicated as it will not provide additional information. Certain breeds are prone to particular diseases. For instance, an older Dachshund withelevated liver enzymesmay have Cushing's syndrome. Labradors, Bedlington terriers, Westies, and Dobermans are predisposed to chronic hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). Shelties and Cocker Spaniels are prone to gallbladder problems. The fact that we see certain diseases in specific breeds suggests that there is a genetic/familial component to some of them, although other factors also play a role. My dog isn't having any symptoms. Should I be worried about the elevated liver enzymes? Dogs with severe liver disease can have a variety of clinical signs – decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, neurologic signs, abdominal distention from fluid, and jaundice (yellow discoloration of gums, eyes, skin, etc). However, some dogs with significant liver disease may not show any clinical signs in the early stages. It is much better to diagnose and treat patients before they get sick. As a result, further workup may still be recommended, even if the dog is not having any clinical signs. An example of this is if your dog has a persistentlyincreased ALT– this can be the first sign of chronic hepatitis, which can progress to liver failure. Some cases of chronic hepatitis are due to a toxic build up ofcopper in the liverthat will continue unless you intervene medically. If your dog isn't acting sick, your veterinarian may recommend a therapeutic trial of antibiotics (to rule out a possible infection), antioxidants (such as vitamin E,Denamarin®, orursodiol(a drug that increases bile flow and decreases inflammation). After a few weeks of therapy, the liver values would be rechecked. Further diagnostics would be warranted if the liver enzymes did not improve. Besides blood tests, what else can be done to diagnose liver problems? An abdominal ultrasound may be recommended by your veterinarian. Some diseases, such as a gallbladder obstruction or liver mass, can be readily identified on ultrasound. Ultrasound may also be useful to check for other diseases (besides a primary liver problem) in the abdomen that can affect the liver enzymes, such as pancreatitis. Some, but not all, dogs with elevated liver enzymes need a liver biopsy to get a diagnosis. Liver biopsies can be obtained with a needle biopsy instrument using ultrasound guidance via a scope (laparoscope) or surgery. Oftentimes, the ultrasound is useful to determine if liver biopsies are needed and which biopsy method is most appropriate. Samples are taken forhistopathology, culture (to rule out infections) and often for measuring copper levels. Your veterinarian may refer you to a specialist for further workup. The treatment and prognosis depend on what is causing the elevated liver enzymes. An optimal treatment plan can be made with your veterinarian once the diagnosis is known.

Category: Flatulence in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Imagine everyone is gathered together for a relaxing evening of snacks and television when gradually there is no way to avoid or ignore the odors being emitted by the otherwise happy family dog. Jokes abound but really a solution to this problem is wanted, especially if it is ongoing. The Science of Flatulence Flatulence comes from an excess of gases in the intestinal tract. These gases may represent air that has been swallowed (especially in short-faced/brachycephalic breeds), gas produced in the biochemical process of digestion, gas diffusion from the bloodstream, or gases produced by the bacteria that populate the intestinal tract. Over 99% of the gases that pass from the intestinal tract are odorless; the gases with objectionable odors are typically those containing hydrogen sulfide. Flatulence is a normal biological function. A surprising amount of air is swallowed with the simple act of eating and if this is not burped out, it must exit through the other end. The amount of air swallowed tends to be increased when dogs feel they must eat quickly or in the brachycephalic breeds who tend to breathe more by mouth rather than by nose. Swallowed air tends not to have objectionable odor. The really stinky gases are produced by colon (large intestine) bacteria. Dietary fiber in pet food is not readily digestible by the pet’s own enzyme systems but is readily digested by the gas-producing bacteria of the colon. As these fibers are broken down, gases are produced. A diet heavy in fibers tends to favor these gas-producing organisms. The more supportive the intestinal environment, the more bacteria there will be and ultimately more gas will be produced. WhatToDoAboutIt The following are easy changes that can be made in your management of the pet: Changing to a low residue diet means that most of the nutrients of the food are digested and absorbed by the pet before they reach the colon where the gas-forming bacteria are. This means there will be less food for the gas-forming organisms, which will ultimately mean fewer gas-forming organisms and less gas formed. Sometimes just going through a case and/or bag of a low residue diet solves the problem and the pet can return to a regular food afterwards. If necessary, the therapeutic diet can become the pet's regular food. Low-residue diets are available through your veterinarian. Prescription Low Residue Diets Changing to a low residue diet means that most of the nutrients of the food are digested and absorbed by the pet before they reach the colon where the gas-forming bacteria are. This means there will be less food for the gas-forming organisms, which will ultimately mean fewer gas-forming organisms and less gas formed. Sometimes just going through a case and/or bag of such a low residue diet solves the problem and the pet can return to a regular food afterwards. If necessary, the therapeutic diet can become the pet’s regular food. Sometimes Medication is Needed A carminative is a medication that reduces flatulence. There is an assortment of available products, but unfortunately most are not helpful or even labeled for animal use. Changing the diet and ruling out actual intestinal disease are of primary importance in addressing flatulence. If further therapy is needed, the following products have some basis to suspect they might work: Yucca shidigera supplementationCurrently this extract is labeled as a flavoring agent for pet food but it is also available as an oral supplement. Several studies have shown that it helps decrease the odor in flatulence. Zinc acetate supplementationZinc binds to sulfhydryl compounds in flatulence ultimately serving to deodorize the gas. Non-absorbable antibiotic Such antibiotics serve to kill the gas-forming bacteria of the colon and may be helpful as long as their use is not ongoing. This is not an ideal method, however, as beneficial bacteria may also be killed off. ProbioticsThere are many ineffective probiotics being marketed so it is important to use one that has been shown to actually contain live cultures and that its cultures actually withstand stomach digestion so as to populate the small intestine with beneficial bacteria. It is unknown if this type of product would really help in flatulence as it is asking a great deal for such bacteria to travel all the way to the colon and attempt to displace the gas-forming resident bacteria. That said, there are several veterinary products that are felt to be reputable: Prostora®  Proviable®, Visbiome®,  and Fortiflora®. Fortiflora has been shown to be effective in reducing flatulence. Prebiotics Prebiotics are special nutrients included in the diet to support and nourish beneficial bacteria and promote a healthy microflora in the colon. Special fibers are usually involved. Use of prebiotics allows the patient to essentially grow their own probiotics right there in their own colon. There are many intestinal diets that include prebiotic mixtures for this purpose. Questionable Products Activated charcoal tabletsCharcoal works by binding material in the intestinal tract so the material in question is not absorbed into the body, or in this case, so that the material is sequestered away from gas-forming bacteria. The idea is to make nutrients unavailable to gas-forming bacteria. Unfortunately, activated charcoal tablets are not likely to be effective as the charcoal binding sites are filled on the journey from mouth to colon and by the time the tablet sees the gas-forming large bowel bacteria, it has essentially been used up and cannot adsorb any more material. SimethiconeSimethicone may control the volume of gas produced but not the odor. It is an antifoaming agent that reduces gas bubbles. Pancreatic enzyme supplementationIn the absence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, it is unlikely that a patient would be helped by extra digestive enzymes. Furthermore, this treatment is relatively expensive for something that only might be helpful.

Category: Giardia in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English See the article summary below. What areGiardia? Giardiaare single-celled organisms, infectious to many types of animals (including humans) all over the world. As you can see in the above image,Giardiaorganisms have little whip-like tentacles called flagella that classify them as flagellates. They use their flagella to move around from place to place, but when they find a spot where they wish to stay (like a cozy nook in the host's intestine), they use a suction cup-like structure (visible in the image) to attach. Their presence in the host intestine can cause diarrhea, though some hosts are symptom-free carriers. Different types ofGiardiainfect different types of animals; it is rare forGiardiafrom apet to transmit to a human; furthermore, dog and catGiardiaspecies are separate and are unlikely to cross from dog to cat or vice versa. Giardia have two forms: the trophozoite and the cyst. The trophozoite is the form that lives within the host, swimming around and attaching with its suction cup. The cyst, however, is the form that lives out in the environment. Trophozoites round up to cysts as they approach the colon and then are passed in feces. Trophozoites that don't round up into cysts and form a shell prior to passing into the cold, cruel world cannot withstand the temperature/moisture variability of the outside world. Cysts are the contagious stage. Trophozoites are in the parasitic stage. Life as aGiardiaOrganism As mentioned, trophozoites and cysts may be passed in fresh feces, but only the hard-shelled little cysts can withstand the conditions of the outside world. The cysts live in the environment (outside the host's body) potentially for months until they are consumed by a host. Inside the host, the cyst's shell is digested away, releasing two trophozoites into the intestine, and the cycle begins again. Contaminated water is the classical source of aGiardiainfection. When a fecal sample is analyzed, the appearance of theGiardiaorganism depends on whether the sample is freshly obtained or if it has been outside of the host's body for a while.Giardiaorganisms begin to round up into cysts in a matter of hours. The active trophozoites rather look like funny faces with the two nuclei forming the eyes and median bodies forming the mouth. Cysts look a bit more generic. In the environment, cysts survive in water and soil as long as it is relatively cool and wet. A host animal will accidentally swallow a cyst when drinking from a puddle, or toilet, or when licking fur. After the cyst has been swallowed, the cyst's shell is digested away, freeing the two trophozoites that go forth and attach to the intestinal lining. As mentioned, the trophozoitewill swim to a spot using its flagella and attach with its suction cup (more correctly called its "ventral disc").Trophozoitestend to live in different intestinal areas in different host species but will move to other areas depending on the diet the host is eating. Thetrophozoitemay round itself up and form a cyst while still inside the host's body. If the host has diarrhea, bothtrophozoitesand cysts may be shed in diarrhea; either form can be found in fresh stool. After infection, it takes 5 to 12 days in dogs or 5 to 16 days in cats forGiardiato be found in the host’s stool. Diarrhea can precede the shedding of theGiardia. Infection is more common in kennel situations where animals are housed in groups. How DoesGiardiaCause Diarrhea? No one is completely sure, but infection seems to cause problems with normal intestinal absorption of vitamins and other nutrients. Diarrhea is generally not bloody with aGiardiainfection. Immune-suppressive medications, such as corticosteroids, can re-activate an oldGiardiainfection. We do not know why some infected hosts get diarrhea while others never do. Diagnosis In the past, diagnosis was difficult. The stool sample being examined needed to be fresh, plusGiardiararely show up on the usual fecal testing methods used to detect other parasites. Several tricks have been developed to makeGiardiaeasier to find (special stains, using special processing solutions, etc.), but what has made the biggest difference in the diagnosis ofGiardiais the ELISA test kit, which is similar in format to a home pregnancy test. This method has dramatically improved the ability to detectGiardiainfections and the test can be completed in just a few minutes while you wait. Giardiashed organisms intermittently and may be difficult to detect. Sometimes pets must be retested in order to find an infection, and asymptomatic carrier animals are common. It should also be mentioned that the ELISA test can remain positive for some time after the infection has been eradicated so if re-testing is desired after a positive test, another test format may be more helpful than the ELISA test kit. Treatment A broad-spectrum dewormer calledfenbendazole(Panacur®) seems to be the most reliable treatment at this time.Metronidazole(Flagyl®) has been a classical treatment forGiardiabut studies show it to only be effective in 67% of cases. For some resistant cases, both medications are used concurrently. Febantel is also commonly used forGiardiaas it is converted to fenbendazole in the body. Because cysts can stick to the fur of the infected patient and be a source for re-infection, the positive animal should receive a bath at least once in the course of treatment. At the least, the patient should have a bath at the end of treatment, plus it is especially important to promptly remove infected fecal matter to minimize environmental contamination. Can Humans Be Infected? The short answer is only rarely, so the concern is pretty low in general. However, maintain good hygiene practices such as regular hand-washing and removing fresh pet fecal matter promptly, as mentioned. That said, here is a more detailed answer:Giardia duodenalisis classified into several subcategories called assemblages and designated A through G. Some assemblages are specific as to which host animals they can infect, and other assemblages are not so picky. Assemblage F, for example, only infects cats, and assemblages C and D only infect dogs but assemblage A will infect dogs, cats, people, rodents, wild mammals, and cattle. Common testing methods do not indicate what assemblage has been detected, so there is always a possibility of human transmission as long as the assemblage is unknown. Environmental Decontamination Giardiacysts are killed in the environment by freezing temperatures and by direct sunlight. If neither of these is practical for the area to be disinfected, a chemical disinfectant will be needed. Organic matter such as dirt or stool is protective of the cyst, so on a concrete surface, do basic cleaning before disinfecting. Quaternary ammonia compounds can be used to killGiardiacysts. Animals should be thoroughly bathed before being reintroduced into a clean area. A properly chlorinated swimming pool should not be able to become contaminated. As for areas with lawns or plants, decontamination will not be possible without killing the plants and allowing the area to dry out in direct sunlight. A Footnote on Vaccination A vaccine againstGiardiawas previously available, not to prevent infection in a vaccinated pet but to reduce the shedding of cysts by the vaccinated patient. In other words, the vaccine was designed to reduce the contamination of a kennel whereGiardiawas expected to be a problem. This would be helpful during an outbreak in a shelter or rescue situation but is not particularly helpful to the average dog whose owner wants to simply prevent infection. Because of the limited usefulness of the vaccine, manufacturing was discontinued in 2009. In Summary: Additional information from the Companion Animal Parasite Counsel (CAPC): DrontalPlus® is effective in treating Giardia in dogs when administered per label directions. CAPC Board majority opinion is that asymptomatic dogs may not require treatment.

Category: Hepatitis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Hepatitis? Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. It is a syndrome - a group of clinical signs or symptoms - rather than a specific disease, and it has many causes. Your dog can have immediate inflammation in their liver called acute hepatitis or long-term inflammation called chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis (CH), also called chronic active hepatitis, can lead to scar tissue formation and cirrhosis in the liver. Cirrhosis is extensive, end-stage scar tissue. Some dogs with acute hepatitis progress to the chronic form. Infectious Canine Hepatitis One disease that causes chronic hepatitis is infectious canine hepatitis (ICH). ICH is caused by a virus but not the same as the Hepatitis A, B or C viruses that cause disease in humans; you and your family won’t get sick if your dog is infected. Similarly, The hepatitis viruses that cause human hepatitis do not affect dogs. ICH is spread through animal feces, urine, saliva and objects. Since most dogs are vaccinated as puppies against ICH, it is considered a rare infection.If you have a young puppy or an unvaccinated dog in your household, they can get ill with this virus.However, outbreaks sometimes occur, mostly in dogs less than 1-year-old or unvaccinated dogs. An infected dog may show signs of depression, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Treatment involves supportive care such as fluids and medications to boost liver function; the latter may includeSAMe,milk thistle,ursodiol, and vitamin E. Causes Aside from ICH, there are many other causes of hepatitis. Causes of acute hepatitis include toxins, drugs, viruses, bacteria (particularlyleptospirosis), and fungi. On the other hand, chronic hepatitis is caused by bacteria, viruses, excess copper in the liver, drugs, and immune system issues. If a cause cannot be determined, this is referred to as idiopathic hepatitis and is the most common cause. Idiopathic means no cause can be found. Age and Breed Predispositions Any dog can have an acute episode of hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis, on the other hand, is most common in middle-aged to older dogs; most dogs diagnosed with chronic hepatitis are 4-10 years old. Some breeds are suspected to have a genetic predisposition to CH, making them more likely to develop it. These include the Bedlington Terrier, Doberman pinscher, West Highland white terrier, Dalmatian, English springer spaniel, American and English cocker spaniels, Jack Russell terrier, and standard poodle, Great Dane, Labrador retriever, and others. CH is also more common in females than males. Signs Dogs with acute hepatitis often have more severe signs than those with CH. Symptoms may include anorexia (lack of appetite), vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, depression, fever, and jaundice (yellow discoloration of the eyes, gums, and skin), enlarged abdomen and weight loss. How serious your dog’s symptoms depend on how much liver damage they have and this may vary from mild to severe. In severe cases, there are signs of bleeding and bruising. Bleeding can occur inside the body or through any opening of the body, such as the nose and mouth. Dogs with chronic hepatitis often appear normal early on. It is often surprising how normal the dog appears, even with significant progressing disease. This is why it is a good idea to pay attention to elevations in the liver enzymes (particularly ALT), as there is a better chance of slowing down the disease the sooner it is detected and appropriate management begins. As the disease gets worse, common signs are poor appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, increased thirst and urination, weakness, jaundice, and weight loss. A small number of dogs have severe signs such as bleeding, incoordination, and behavior changes. Similar to acute hepatitis, bleeding can occur through any opening in the body. Diagnosis Similar to many illnesses, a thorough history and physical examination from your veterinarian are crucial to making a diagnosis. Drug history and potential exposure to toxins are particularly important as these can cause significant liver damage. Some dogs with hepatitis have increased levels of liver enzymes that can be seen on lab work. These increases do not have to be large to be important; they may indicate liver damage but can also be caused by many different diseases. Elevated liver values are a common abnormality, but they are often non-specific and can be confusing to pet owners. Not all cases of elevated liver enzymes indicate specific liver disease. The liver performs many functions and, in some cases, the liver enzymes may elevate due to problems elsewhere in the body, or simply due to age. It is a good idea to look into these sooner rather than later, especially if your dog is one of the breeds predisposed to hepatitis. They may be the only abnormality a dog with chronic hepatitis has at that time. To add to the confusion, some dogs with hepatitis can have normal liver enzymes. This normalcy does not rule out chronic hepatitis: CH can be so severe in some dogs that there is little functioning liver tissue left to release enzymes, making test results look ‘normal.' If hepatitis is suspected, your veterinarian may recommend a serum bile acids test specifically to evaluate liver function. Another diagnostic test is an abdominal ultrasound. Abnormalities on these tests may strongly suggest hepatitis, but often do not pinpoint a cause. A liver biopsy is the most accurate way to make a diagnosis. Treatment Treating a dog with acute hepatitis involves supportive therapy such as fluids, medications and antioxidants. Treating chronic hepatitis has several goals: treat the underlying cause, reduce inflammation and scarring/cirrhosis, provide supportive care, and treat complications. This support may involve changing current medications, use of antibiotics, and medication meant to reduce excess copper. Steroids, and/or other immunosuppressive drugs, may be used to reduce inflammation if infection is not suspected. Supportive care works to boost liver function, while treating complications depends on the specific problems. Your dog may benefit from specific dietary changes depending on their individual condition and the cause of their chronic hepatitis. Dogs whose chronic hepatitis is associated with excess copper in the liver should be fed diets reduced in copper. They can also have a zinc gluconate supplement added to their food which acts to reduce copper levels as well. Regardless of cause, dogs with chronic hepatitis may benefit from diets with restricted protein levels. Restricted protein diets are not always necessary however and are only considered if your dog has evidence of protein intolerance. Your veterinarian will work with you to determine if your dog needs to be on a protein restricted diet. Another important dietary factor to consider for a dog with CH is how tasty and nutritious the food is. Dogs with CH often do not want to or are reluctant to eat. It's important your pet's food is appetizing to them and has high levels of carbohydrates and moderate levels of fat to provide them with their necessary calories. There is evidence that fiber may benefit dogs with liver disease and is another factor to consider increasing in your dog's diet. Prognosis Your pet’s prognosis depends on the underlying cause of their hepatitis. In general, acute hepatitis has a better prognosis than the chronic form. If the liver is not too damaged, most dogs recover. Some, however, progress to chronic hepatitis. According to one study, the average survival time with chronic hepatitis was two to three years, although individual results depend on the condition and response to treatment. Identification of the liver disease (via biopsies) is the best way to ensure the proper treatment. The prognosis is much worse if scarring and/or cirrhosis is extensive or blood clotting test results are abnormal. To ensure the health of your pet, it is important to not only treat hepatitis as soon as it is diagnosed, but also to look into abnormal test results such as elevated liver enzymes; these may be early signs of liver issues.

Category: Hepatozoonosis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hepatozoonosis is a parasitic infection of dogs primarily caused by eitherHepatozoon canisorHepatozoon americanum. The illness is difficult to treat and can be fatal in dogs showing symptoms. Both forms are transmitted from ticks and are debilitating. Without treatment, chronic wasting begins in either form, which usually ends with death within 12 months. Species ofHepatozoonare protozoans, which are a different kind of infectious organism than bacteria or viruses. Like ameba, protozoans are single-celled parasites that live in the environment. Although both species cause hepatozoonosis, the disease and recommended treatment are different. People cannot be infected by these protozoa. Transmission and Infection Ticks get infected by feeding from a host, and then transmit Hepatozoon protozoans to dogs when the dog ingests them. This is not a disease in which ticks biting the dog make it sick. The tick becomes infected with protozoans after it has a blood meal from an infected animal. This can occur by eating birds or rodents with infected ticks attached, or eating a tick on themselves. Infection does not occur because of a tick bite, and dogs are not infectious to each other. Hepatozoonprotozoans develop to a certain life stage in the tick to allow for infection of another animal. Dogs must eat the infected tick in order to become infected. Concurrent infection, debilitating disease, immunosuppressant drugs, and young age increase a dog’s chances of becoming infected and having symptoms. Symptoms of Infection H. canisandH. americanumhave different symptoms, ticks, life cycles, and prevalence.H. americanumcomes from dogs eating Gulf Coast ticks, and the brown dog tick conveysH. canis.Many dogs have mild symptoms, or none. When a dog is infected withH. canis, the protozoans reproduce and develop primarily in organs associated with blood storage (e.g. spleen) or the immune system (e.g. bone marrow, lymph nodes). You may see your dog not wanting to move around, and he may have fever, pale gums and skin, and enlarged lymph nodes. Many infected dogs do not have symptoms. Disease tends to be less severe than withH. americanum. Young dogs less than 18 months of age are most frequently affected byH. canis. H. americanumprotozoans tend to be a far more severe disease that reproduces and develops in muscles, including the heart. Cysts — thick, protective capsules — can form around the organisms, resulting in life-long infections. A dog’s immune system tends to respond more strongly to these protozoans compared to H. canis, leading to severe reactions. The infection can result in symptoms such as pain in the muscle, bone, and/or joints. Infected dogs may limp or be unable to walk, seem painful when touched, run a fever, and lose weight. Diagnosis A veterinarian will need to examine the dog to note all the physical abnormalities. Blood can be drawn to check immune cells, blood cells, and to make sure the internal organs are working properly. X-rays may help determine the extent of damage and rule out other diseases. Hepatozoonosis can sometimes be diagnosed by blood tests. Examining blood under the microscope can also be helpful for diagnosis. In many cases, a biopsy needs to be taken from infected muscle and examined by a pathologist to determine which protozoan is responsible for the infection. Treatment Treatment is difficult in dogs showing symptoms. Sadly, many dogs cannot be cured. Dogs infected withHepatozoonorganisms can be treated with medications that will decrease the severity of the symptoms, but return of symptoms is common. It’s more difficult to control symptoms inH. americanumthanH. canis. Pain medications, blood transfusions, and nutritional or fluid support such as intravenous fluids, syringe feeding, and high calorie diets may be needed for dogs with severe symptoms. Remember, treatment will not cure your dog, but can make him more comfortable and give him a higher quality of life. Prevention No vaccines are available for hepatozoonosis. The best method for prevention is aggressive, year round tick prevention, as well as keeping your dog from hunting and eating wild rodents or birds (often easier said than done). Treat the yard for ticks if it does not freeze in your climate. Remove ticks quickly from your dog to keep him from eating them.

Category: Intestinal Lymphangiectasia (Protein-losing Enteropathy) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is a Protein-Losing Enteropathy? If the intestine is leaking nutrients out instead of absorbing them in, clearly the result is a nutritional disaster. In protein-losing enteropathy, that is exactly what is happening: the intestine and/or stomach is actually leaking out protein. This is obviously a serious problem as without protein coming in, the body's only choice for making the proteins it needs is breaking down existing proteins and reassembling their amino acids into new proteins.  Muscle is broken down to make way for higher priority blood proteins. The immune system's ability to make antibody proteins may be compromised.  Debilitation results from protein break-down and the intestinal disease that started it all facilitates this by creating diarrhea. Lymphangiectasia is one of several protein-losing enteropathies. Albumin Loss in Protein-Losing Enteropathy The main protein that one cannot afford to lose is called albumin. This protein normally is produced by the liver and it circulates in the bloodstream acting as a carrier for biochemicals that require transport but cannot actually dissolve in blood by themselves. Albumin can be considered sort of a mass transit system in the bloodstream, a bus or subway, if you will, carrying important biochemicals from one place to another. Albumin, by being the most prevalent blood protein, is also responsible (by virtue of the complicated concept of oncotic pressure) for actually keeping fluid in the bloodstream. When fluid cannot be held within the vasculature, it leaks out into body cavities (effusion) or into tissue in general as edema (swelling). Of course, in a protein-losing enteropathy other proteins are lost, too. Antibodies, proteins of blood clotting, enzymes, etc. all leak out the intestine and are forever lost in the feces that exits the body. The body tries hard to maintain its albumin level by extracting protein from other sources (like muscle), and having the liver make albumin from the components of these other proteins. This may help maintain a workable amount of albumin in the bloodstream but it comes at the expense of muscle tissue and other working proteins. There are several described causes of protein-losing enteropathy: We will limit our discussion to lymphangiectasia. What is Intestinal Lymphangiectasia? Lymph is a fluid that circulates through the body similar to the way blood does; however, the heart actively pumps blood through the body while lymph is pumped passively via the normal muscle activity of the body. Lymph consists of cells called lymphocytes. They are cells of the immune system as well as the fluid that collects from the tissues and shunts into lymphatic vessels, which are similar to veins.The word lymphangiectasia means dilated lymph vessels. In the intestinal tract, lymphangiectasia is usually caused by some kind of inflammation that puts pressure back on the lymph vessels, leading them to dilate. Lymph flow may be blocked by the inflammatory events in the intestine or local structures. Lacteals are a specific type of lymph vessels in the intestinal tract designed to absorb nutritional fats. The intestine is able to absorb our nutrients through small finger-like structures called microvilli. Lacteals run though the center of the microvilli happily imbibing fats from the food we have eaten. When there is high pressure within the lymph vessels, the tender lacteals burst and instead of absorbing fats, the lymph inside them, including cells, fats, and precious proteins are lost into the intestinal tract. The intestine may be able to reabsorb some of these valuable substances at other sites but if the inflammatory intestinal disease that started the problem in the first place is widespread, the balance may have shifted to nutritional loss rather than gain. Small terrier breeds, particularly the Yorkshire terrier, appear predisposed to the development of lymphangiectasia. Lymphangiectasia is extremely rare in cats. What Does One See at Home? Weight loss is the most consistent sign along with chronic diarrhea, vomiting, and, in more advanced cases, fluid accumulation in the abdomen creating a bloated appearance. How do we Make a Diagnosis? In most cases, an obviously sick, skinny dog is brought to the veterinarian. Sometimes the above classical signs are seen but sometimes there is no specific hint of this condition until blood test results are in. Low Lymphocyte CountAnimals with lymphangiectasia have lymphocytes rolling out their lacteals and into their intestine to be lost forever. The low blood lymphocyte count is so consistent with lymphangiectasia that it is difficult to make this diagnosis if this finding is not present. Low CholesterolCholesterol is part of the lymph fluid that gets lost. Low Albumin LevelLow blood albumin level is the most consistent finding in lymphangiectasia, though it is possible to have lymphangiectasia in only a small portion of the intestine and still maintain a normal albumin level. There are a limited number of conditions that can lead to a low albumin level: a protein-losing enteropathy; a protein-losing nephropathy where the albumin is lost via leaking kidney membranes; reduced albumin production by a diseased liver; hypoadrenocorticism, a deficiency in cortisone; or serum leakage through extreme skin damage such as third-degree burns. These conditions can be easily ruled out one by one. It is obvious if there are third-degree burns. If there are none, a routine urinalysis will indicate if there is significant protein loss in the urine and if glomerular disease should be pursued. A liver function test such as a bile acids test will indicate whether or not there is latent liver failure. Blood testing can be easily done to rule outhypoadrenocorticism(also called Addison's disease). If there aren't any of these conditions, then there must be a protein-losing enteropathy by exclusion. Biopsy will be needed to determine the nature of the intestinal disease causing the protein-losing enteropathy. Biopsy Tissue sampling is necessary to distinguish the intestinal diseases that cause protein-losing enteropathy. With most PLE patients being deficient in albumin, this means they are not in a good position to heal from a surgical biopsy so endoscopy is generally recommended as it is less invasive. With endoscopy, a small camera on a long flexible scope travels down the mouth, through the stomach and into the intestine (or up the anus past the large intestine and into the lower small intestine) where biopsy samples can be pinched off with a grabber. The procedure requires general anesthesia but is otherwise low risk and most patients can go home the same day. Often the areas of intestinal disease are patchy and surrounded by large areas of normal intestine so it is important to biopsy the right area. Ultrasound of the abdomen prior to endoscopy is helpful in determining where to sample, plus often a few spoons of corn oil or other fat are often fed a few hours prior to biopsy so that dilated lacteals with plump and leaking fat visibly in the best areas for biopsy. Because PLE patients often lose important vitamins and blood clotting factors, blood clotting tests are generally done just prior to endoscopy. Treatment The first step in treatment is to address the underlying cause. In many cases of lymphangiectasia, there is an association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Whether or not the IBD is actually causing the lymphangiectasia remains a matter of speculation but anti-inflammatories are often used aggressively in lymphangiectasia patients.Prednisolonehas been the traditional immune suppressive medication in this situation but as it causes an increase in water consumption that can contribute to edema, other medications - particularlycyclosporine- have become more popular as it does not have steroid side effects. Intestinal loss of a body protein called anti-thrombin III tends to form abnormal blood clots that can lodge in inappropriate places (embolization). As prevention, anti-clotting medications are often used.Aspirinhas been traditional butclopidogrelis gaining popularity. Approximately 10% of dogs with a protein-losing enteropathy will experience clotting abnormalities if prevention is not begun. Nutritional management of PLE is a bit tricky. The diet must be especially digestible and high in protein (20-25% protein on a dry matter basis) so as to replace all the protein being lost through the leaky GI tract. Further, the diet should be no more than 15% fat on a dry matter basis (lower for more severely affected patients). Reading a diet label shows percentages on an "as fed" basis, so to compare diets, it is necessary to convert values to a dry matter basis through knowing the moisture content. To see how this is done read How to Convert Food Values below. There are therapeutic diets available for diseases like this one where fat restriction is crucial. Non-prescription diets are unlikely to meet the above criteria but if you know how to read the food label properly you may be able to find one. Injectable vitamin supplements are likely to be needed. Severely affected dogs will find even the fat content of the prescription diets too high and may need to begin with what is called an "elemental diet." These are typically made for humans and are powders that can be mixed with water. They are not nutritionally balanced for dogs and can only be used for a few weeks. Alternatively, home cooked diets can be used but aprofessional veterinary nutritionistshould be consulted to get a proper recipe. Again, because of intestinal absorption issues injectable vitamin supplements are likely to be needed. Vitamin D3 deficiency is common in protein-losing enteropathies so expect supplementation to be recommended. The goal is to eventually return to a standard commercial dog food. If the underlying condition is treatable then prognosis for lymphangiectasia is good, but if it it proves resistant, the prognosis is not so positive. Reported survival rates are highly variable. Understand that lymphangiectasia is unlikely to be cured and at best can be managed. How to Convert Food Values from "As Fed" to "Dry Matter" First, find the "Guaranteed Analysis" on the label of the food. It should look something like this: Crude Protein (min) 7.5%Crude Fat (min) 4%Crude Fiber (max) 2%Moisture (max) 76% In this case the moisture content is 76%. Subtracting from 100%, that means that there is 24% dry matter (the actual food). In other words, this can of puppy food is 76% water and 24% actual nutrients. To convert the guaranteed analysis numbers to dry matter basis, simply divide them by the percentage of the diet that is dry matter: Crude protein: 7.5 divided by 24 = 0.31 or 31%Crude fat: 4 divided by 24 = 0.166 or 16.6%Crude fiber: 2 divided by 24 =0.08 or 8% Foods can only truly be compared by converting to dry matter basis.

Category: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The signs of inflammation in the colon (also called the large intestine) are the same regardless of the cause: gooey, mucous diarrhea, straining to pass stool, cramping, and sometimes a surprising urgency to "go." These symptoms can be acute, as is common with short-term stress like boarding, returning from boarding, or diet change, or they can be chronic, as withwhipworm infectionorinflammatory bowel disease. Many people get confused betweeninflammatorybowel disease (IBD) andirritablebowel syndrome (IBS). IBD is a physical disease where the intestinal lining is infiltrated by inflammatory cells. The delicate intestinal lining becomes thickened, and it alters the absorption of nutrients. The infiltration can be seen under the microscope, which is how the diagnosis is confirmed. Inflammatory Bowel Disease is a completely different disease from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, so if you are looking for information on Inflammatory Bowel Disease, please click the link above. IBS is a psychosomatic disease. It is the activity of the mind that causes the symptoms. Most people have had some kind of experience where stress has produced intestinal distress, be it cramping, nausea, diarrhea or all of the above. Chronic anxiety can similarly result in chronic diarrhea. This is basically what IBS is all about. Intestinal biopsy results are normal because there is nothing directly wrong with the large intestine. The process is the same whether the patient is human or non-human. Large intestinal diarrhea in veterinary patients can have many causes and IBS is afoot in about 10-15% of cases. It is important to rule out physical causes before blaming psychological reasons, but if all tests are normal and treatment for physical problems is not yielding results, this is when a biopsy is helpful. If after medication trials, diet trials, and diagnostic tests, including biopsy, are all normal, then it is time to consider IBS. It should be noted that fresh blood in the diarrhea is common with large intestinal diarrheas but not so much with the large intestinal diarrhea of IBS.  Fresh blood in the diarrhea is a sign that there is a physical cause and not a psychosomatic cause. Knowing this can help direct the medical approach. Treatment of IBS Most commonly, IBS is addressed via the GI tract rather than via the psyche. Increasing dietary fiber is helpful to many IBS patients as fiber has been found to help normalize the spasms of the large intestinal muscles and many therapeutic high-fiber diets are sold through veterinary hospitals. If your pet finds these unpalatable, ask your veterinarian about how to add wheat bran or a commercial fiber supplement to a diet your pet prefers. There are presently several commercial dog foods that contain calming supplements. Using one of these plus a fiber supplement might cover both the fiber angle as well as the anxiety. For many patients, cage rest or tranquilizers allows for enough rest to control symptoms. Antispasmodics or general anti-diarrhea medications such asloperamide,azulfidine, ormetronidazolecan be used on an "as needed" basis to control signs. A number of supplements (not to mention pheromone products) have recently been marketed to address anxiety. These are not as strong as prescription drugs but are available without a prescription for those who wish to try them: Alpha Casozepine:This is a milk protein with natural calming properties. It is available as an oral supplement (Zylkene®) for pets or in special calming pet foods (Royal Canin Calm Diet®, Hills Urinary Stress C/d for cats®). L-Theanine:This is a derivative of green tea and is available in capsules as well as flavored chews (Anxitane®, Solliquin®, Composure®). Adaptil Defuser and Collars:Dog Appeasement Pheromone or D.A.P. is naturally secreted by mother dogs to communicate safety and security to her litter of puppies. This pheromone has been synthesized and is available as a room spray, plug-in wall defuser, and an impregnated collar that the dog can wear. This gives the anxious dog a message in his or her own language that there is nothing to be anxious about. Cannabinoids:These are obviously controversial and are not presently legal except as hemp products which may be appropriate. CBD is commonly marketed for pets, but at the present time, none of the recent legalization efforts have included pet products, and quality control is lacking. A more aggressive approach might be addressing the anxiety with medications. The source of emotional stress may not be obvious, but general anti-anxiety medications such asamitriptyline,clomipramine, orfluoxetinemay be of use, particularly if the anxiety source is not clear or cannot be removed. Some patients will respond to supplements as listed above. It is important to imagine the pet’s world from his/her own perspective. The pet does not speak English and must infer what is going on from events he or she witnesses directly. Inconsistent scheduling, moving to a new home, noisy construction nearby, or even weather changes can confuse an animal. Consult your veterinarian if you wish to pursue one of these therapies. However, keep in mind that IBS is not diagnosed until a medical workup for physical causes of large bowel diarrhea has not shown any reason for illness.

Category: Pancreatitis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English See article summary below. The Normal Pancreas and What it Does  The pancreas is a pale pink glandular organ that nestles cozily just under the stomach and along the first portion of the small intestine. As a glandular organ, the pancreas is all about the secretion of biochemicals, and it has two main jobs: the first job is the secretion of digestive enzymes to help us break down the nutrients we eat. The second job is the secretions of insulin and glucagon (hormones that regulate how we actually use the nutrients we have eaten). It is the first job (the digestive enzyme part) that concerns us in pancreatitis. So, let's go back to the beginning of digestion. We eat food, chew it up into a slurry, and swallow it. It travels down the esophagus to the stomach, where it is ground up further, and enzymes are added to begin the breakdown of nutrients into pieces (basically into molecules) small enough for us to absorb. Digestion continues as the food moves down into the small intestine, where stomach acid is neutralized, and further digestive enzymes are added (thanks to the pancreas).  Food moves down the small intestine further, and the focus shifts from nutrient digestion to nutrient absorption. By the time the food has reached the large intestine, it is just undigestible waste and water. The large intestine absorbs the water, and its bacteria may be able to break down some of the waste. After that, food comes out the other end into the toilet or litter box. So, the normal pancreas makes and stores digestive enzymes for use when you need your meal digested. Keep in mind these enzymes are powerful and made to break down food. Imagine if they escaped and tried to break down the pancreas itself! Unfortunately, that is what happens in pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is Inflammation of the Pancreas In pancreatitis, inflammation disrupts the normal integrity of the pancreas. Digestive enzymes are normally stored safely as inactive forms within pancreatic granules so that they are harmless but in pancreatitis, they are prematurely activated and released internally, digesting the body itself. The result can be a metabolic catastrophe. The living tissue becomes further inflamed, and the tissue damage quickly involves the adjacent liver. Toxins released from this rampage of tissue destruction are liberated into the circulation and can cause a body-wide inflammatory response.  If the pancreas is affected so as to disrupt its ability to produce insulin,diabetes mellituscan result; this can be either temporary or permanent. Specific Pancreatitis Disasters The good news is that most commonly, the inflammation is confined to the area of the liver and pancreas but even with this limitation, pancreatitis can be painful and life-threatening. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic, mild or severe. What Causes Pancreatitis In most cases, we never find out what causes it, but we do know some events that can cause pancreatitis. The area of the small intestine where the pancreas secretes its enzymes is called the "duodenum." A small tube called the "pancreatic duct" transports pancreatic enzymes into the duodenum. Backwash (reflux) of duodenal contents backward up into the pancreatic duct can create inflammation in the pancreas. The pancreas has numerous safety mechanisms to prevent self-digestion. One of these mechanisms is the fact that the enzymes it creates are stored in an inactive form. They are harmless until they are mixed with activating enzymes made by the duodenum. If duodenal fluids backwash up the pancreatic duct and into the pancreas, enzymes are prematurely activated, and pancreatitis results. This is apparently the most common pancreatitis mechanism in humans, though it is not very common in veterinary patients. Signs of Pancreatitis The classical signs in the dog are appetite loss, vomiting, diarrhea, a painful abdomen, and fever or any combination thereof. Pancreatitis can come on suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere or it can be a smoldering on-going condition that waxes and wanes. Making the Diagnosis Lipase and Amylase Levels (no longer considered reliable) A reliable blood test has been lacking for this disease until recently. Traditionally, blood levels of amylase and lipase (two pancreatic digestive enzymes) have been used. When their levels are especially high, it's reasonable sign that these enzymes have leaked out of the pancreas, and the patient has pancreatitis, but these tests are not as sensitive or specific as we would prefer. Amylase and lipase can elevate dramatically with corticosteroid use, with intestinal perforation, kidney disease, or even dehydration. Some experts advocate measuring lipase and amylase on fluid from the belly rather than on blood but this has not been fully investigated and is somewhat invasive. Pancreatic Lipase Immunoreactivity A newer test called the PLI, or pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity, test has come to be important. As mentioned, lipase is one of the pancreatic digestive enzymes and only small traces are normally in the circulation. These levels jump dramatically in pancreatitis, which allows for the diagnosis to be confirmed with a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive test. The PLI test is different from the regular lipase level because the PLI test measures only lipase of pancreatic origin and thus is more specific. The problem is that technology needed to run this test is unique and the test can only been run in certain facilities on certain days. Results are not necessarily available rapidly enough to help a sick patient. Spec CPL and DGGR Lipase Assay More recently a new test called the SPEC cPL (specific canine pancreatic lipase) test has become available. This test is a newer generation immunological test for canine pancreatic lipase and can be run overnight by a reference lab. This test is able to detect 83 percent of pancreatitis cases (the test is 83 percent sensitive) and excludes other possible diseases in 98 percent of cases (i.e. the test is 98 percent specific for pancreatitis). The CPL test has been adapted into an in-house test kit and can be run in approximately 30 minutes. Some kits provide a numeric value while others are simply positive or negative depending on whether the CPL level surpasses the normal level. These kits have made diagnosis of pancreatitis much more rapid and convenient. A similar lipase assay called the DGGR Lipase Assay (Precision PSL® test). This test can be run at a reference laboratory with results obtained usually overnight; there is no in-hospital test kit. The diagnosis of pancreatitis is not made solely on the basis of a lab test. These tests are not used to screen patients that are not sick; the entire clinical picture of a given patient is considered in making this or any other diagnosis. Imaging Radiographs can show a widening of the angle of the duodenum against the stomach, which indicates a swelling of the pancreas. Most veterinary hospitals have the ability to take radiographs but this type of imaging is not very sensitive in detecting pancreatitis and only is able to find 24 percent of cases. Ultrasound, on the other hand, detects 68% of cases and provides the opportunity to image other organs and even easily collect fluid from the belly. Since pancreatitis can be accompanied by a tumor near the pancreas, ultrasound provides the opportunity to catch such complicating factors. In some cases, surgical exploration is the only way to make the correct diagnosis. Treatment The most important feature of treatment is aggressively rehydrating the patient with intravenous fluids as this restores the circulation to the pancreas and supports the natural healing mechanisms of the body.  This means that the best route to recovery involves hospitalization. Fluids are continued until the patient is able to reliably drink and hold down adequate fluid intake, a process that commonly takes the better part of a week. Pain and nausea medication is needed to keep the patient comfortable, restore interest in food, and prevent further dehydration. Plasma transfusion is somewhat controversial in treating pancreatitis. On one hand, plasma replenishes some of the natural blood proteins that are consumed by circulating digestive enzymes and would seem to make sense. In humans with pancreatitis, however, no benefit has been shown with plasma transfusion. Whether or not the protection afforded by plasma is real or theoretical is still being worked out. Higher mortality has been associated with patients receiving plasma, but this may be because they were sicker than patients who did not receive plasma to begin with. In the past, nutritional support was delayed in pancreatitis patients as it was felt that stimulating the pancreas to secrete enzymes would encourage on-going inflammation, but this theory has been rethought. Currently, an earlier return to feeding has been found to be beneficial to the GI tract's ability to resume function. If nausea controls through medication does not give the patient a reasonable appetite, assisted feeding is started using a fat-restricted diet. Return of food interest and resolution of vomiting/diarrhea generally means the patient is ready to return to the home setting. Low-fat diets are crucial to managing pancreatitis, and their use should be continued for several weeks before attempting to return to regular dog food. Some dogs can never return to regular dog food and require prescription low-fat foods indefinitely. Pancreatitis is a highly inflammatory disease. Fever, elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, and other signs of inflammation occur frequently in patients with pancreatitis. Infection is rare in pancreatitis, but when it does happen, it can lead to serious complications. Your veterinarian can help decide if antibiotics are needed, but in most uncomplicated cases, they are not part of the treatment regimen. Supportive care includes more than just intravenous fluids. Nausea medication, pain relief, and possibly protecting the stomach from ulceration are all commonly included in the treatment plan. The specifics will be individually tailored for each situation. Panoquell-CA1®(fuzapladib sodium) is a new productreleased in 2023for the treatment of acute pancreatitis. It is given by IV injection for the first 3 days of hospitalization. Heretofore, treatment has been "supportive," which means we make the patient comfortable with symptomatic relief and support the circulation through the pancreas with IV fluids until the pancreas can heal on its own. This new medication represents actual treatment in that it prevents harmful white blood cells from entering the pancreas where they would release their own inflammatory biochemicals. This treatment is meant to actually stop the inflammation in the pancreas. It is used for acute/sudden severe cases and not for ongoing milder cases. How Much Fat is Okay? There are several ultra-low fat diets made for pancreatitis patients, and your veterinarian will likely be sending your dog home with one of them. Remember that pancreatitis is a diet-sensitive disease so it is important not to feed unsanctioned foods, or you risk a recurrence. If your dog will not eat one of the commercial therapeutic diets, you will either need to home-cook or find another diet that is appropriately low in fat (less than 7 percent fat on a dry matter basis). In order to determine the fat content of a pet food, some calculation is needed to take into consideration how much moisture is in the food. The Guaranteed Analysis on the bag or can of food will have two values that we are interested in: the % moisture and the % crude fat. To determine the % fat in the food, you must first determine the % dry matter of the food. This is done by subtracting the moisture content from 100. For example, if the moisture content is 15%, the dry matter is 85%. If the moisture content is 75%, the dry matter is 25%, and so on. Next, take the % crude fat from the label and divide the % crude fat by the % dry matter. For example, if the moisture content is 76%, this means the dry matter is 24%. If the crude fat content is 4%, the true fat content is 4 divided by 24 which =0.16 (16%). Such a food would be way too high in fat for a dog with pancreatitis. You want the number to be 0.07 (7%) or less. Simply reading the fat content off the label does not take into account the moisture content of the food and will not tell you what you need to know. If this is too much math, the staff at your vet's hospital can help you out. When in doubt, canned chicken, fat-free cottage cheese and/or boiled white rice will work in a pinch. Eventually, there will be a point where the tests will be repeated. At that point, it will be determined if the patient has chronic pancreatitis and will need long-term dietary modification or if the episode has concluded. The safest diet going forward will be therapeutic low-fat diets used during the acute episode, but if you want to transition to a conventional diet, this can be done. If you restart a regular diet, it is best to recheck pancreatitis testing in a few weeks to be sure that there is no recurrence on the horizon. Alternatively, a diet with a moderate fat restriction (15% by dry matter, as calculated above) might make for a happy medium. Beware of Diabetes Mellitus When the inflammation subsides in the pancreas, some scarring is inevitable. When 80% of the pancreas is damaged to the extent that insulin cannot be produced,diabetes mellitusresults. This may or may not be permanent, depending on the capacity of the pancreas’ tissue to recover.

Category: Perianal Fistulae in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called perineal fistulae, anorectal abscesses, perianal fissures, perianal sinuses, and pararectal fistulae.) Most people are not in the habit of inspecting the area under their dog’s tail unless the dog seems to be doing something that indicates a problem. Signs of a problem might include licking under the tail, scooting the rear end on the ground, or seeming to be in pain when sitting or raising the tail. When the tail is lifted and the anus inspected, a dog with perianal fistulae will show deep open crevices and some oozing pus all around the anal sphincter. It may not be possible to get a good look as pain may preclude lifting the tail, but odor may be noted, and the dog might be straining to defecate. There is also an association of perianal fistulae with the mucous diarrhea of colitis so that might be seen as well. Perianal fistulae wax and wane but ultimately over time the condition is progressive, ulcerating the surface of the anus and its surroundings. What Causes this Condition? At this time, no one knows but recent information suggests an immune-mediated basis. There seems to be some genetic basis as the German shepherd dog seems predisposed to this condition, though this phenomenon may be more about conformation than about a specific genetic factor for the disease. Relative to other breeds, the German shepherd dog has an increased number of apocrine sweat glands, the type of sweat glands that produce stinky oily sweat (as opposed to watery sweat) in the anal area relative to other breeds. The average age of onset is 5 years and approximately twice as many males are affected as females. While any breed can be affected, 85% of affected dogs are German shepherd dogs. Theanal glandsmay or may not be involved in the fistulation, but there seems to be a clear association with concurrent colitis (inflammation of the colon), as mentioned. Approximately 85% of affected dogs are German shepherd dogs. What Else Could it Be? Several conditions can produce ulcerative lesions around the anal sphincter. While perianal fistulae have a typical history and appearance, it is important to get the right diagnosis. Some conditions that might look similar include: Treatment This condition is an immune-mediated disease. Treatment centers on suppressing the immune reaction that is causing the problem, and this means immunosuppressive drugs will be the centerpiece of therapy. Realize from the beginning that, while improvement is evident within a couple of weeks, it will take 2 to 5 months to get the lesions fully under control and that maintenance therapy may be needed for the remainder of the animal’s life. The good news is that control can usually be achieved and continued with maintenance levels of medication. Immune Suppression Years ago, an assortment of surgical procedures were used to trim the diseased tissues of the perineal fistulae but immunomodulating drugs have largely supplanted surgery. In particular, two medications have emerged:cyclosporine(an oral drug) and tacrolimus (a topical drug). Many dogs will need both to control their disease at least at first, but often the topical product can be used alone once the pain has been controlled. CyclosporineCyclosporine was originally developed for organ transplant patients to prevent organ rejection by modulating the immune response without necessarily suppressing it. Medication is given twice daily and improvement should be seen within the first two weeks of use. Cyclosporine is an expensive medication and there is tremendous controversy over whether or not generics are bioequivalent. Only microemulsion forms of cyclosporine are effective which usually means a brand-name veterinary product. Higher-dose protocols seem to yield faster, more sustained results. As mentioned, improvement is typically obvious within the first two weeks though several months are needed for the resolution of lesions. After the disease is controlled, cyclosporine may be tapered off over another 3-5 months. Approximately 50% of dogs will not be able to fully discontinue medications and their symptoms will recur within 2-12 months if a maintenance schedule is not implemented. This could involve tacrolimus (see below) or cyclosporine or both. Cyclosporine tissue levels can be boosted (and expense mitigated) with the concurrent use ofketoconazole, an antifungal drug. This trick can be used to cut the dose of cyclosporine and save money. There is controversy regarding whether blood levels of cyclosporine help determine dose and what the relationship is between tissue levels and blood levels. Because of the long-term use needed to control perianal fistulae, it is best to monitor liver enzymes or liver function tests in the patient; cyclosporine blood levels may or may not be recommended by your doctor. TacrolimusTacrolimus is a much stronger immunomodulator than cyclosporine. Because it can be applied directly to the fistulae, high tissue levels can be achieved right in the area they are needed. The potential for side effects and expense is also much more favorable than that of cyclosporine, but only 50 percent of dogs experienced resolution with tacrolimus alone after 16 weeks versus 85 percent with cyclosporine. In a perfect world, both oral cyclosporine and topical tacrolimus are used at the same time but after the condition is controlled, tacrolimus alone can be used to prevent recurrence. It is important to wear gloves when applying tacrolimus as this medication has been linked to an increased risk of cancer in humans but not in dogs. Other OptionsCyclosporine currently dominates treatment for this condition but it is an expensive drug and it may not be feasible to use it for months on end in a large breed dog. In this event, prednisolone has been used but there are undesirable side effects with high-dose steroid use (extreme thirst, increased appetite, weight gain, panting, muscle loss) and approximately 30 percent of dogs will not respond. Azathioprineis a stronger immune-suppressive drug. The above side effects are not associated with its use though bone marrow suppression is possible and some monitoring tests are generally recommended. Because it takes some time to exert its effects, it is commonly combined withprednisoloneat least at first. Approximately 50 percent of dogs were able to achieve remission with azathioprine in combination with a limited-ingredient diet (see below). Supportive Therapy Beyond Immune Suppression AntibioticsSince these lesions are commonly infected at least at the beginning of treatment, antibiotics are typically prescribed. A topical antibiotic may be helpful for long-term infection control. It is important to realize that antibiotics alone will not control this deeply rooted problem; they are merely adjunctive to control complicating infections. Stool SoftenersBecause of the ulcerations, defecation may be painful. To minimize the straining, stool softeners may be prescribed. Novel Protein / Limited Ingredient DietFood allergy seems to be a possible etiology in this condition so using foods that the patient could not possibly be allergic to has been a recommended adjunctive therapy. Such diets are typically made from unusual protein sources such as rabbit, duck, kangaroo, fish, or venison. Most veterinary hospitals stock appropriate food. It is important to note that there is nothing especially hypoallergenic about these unusual proteins; the idea is that the patient has likely never eaten them before. If the patient has never been exposed to these proteins, there should be no possibility of allergy as developing allergy requires multiple exposures to a protein.  In one study, 50 percent of the dogs with perianal fistulae also hadcolitis(colon inflammation and associated mucous diarrhea). If this is not a coincidence, then the fistulae should respond to some of the treatments that help colitis and this would include a hypoallergenic diet. Surgery: If Immune Suppression Fails Before we had cyclosporine, perianal fistulae were treated surgically with mixed results. Presently, surgery is only recommended for patients for whom immunosuppression has failed or where the anal glands are involved. The goal of surgery is to remove the proliferative or dead tissue, prevent or treat any anal or rectal strictures (narrowed areas caused by scarring), and change the “environment” of the perineal region. Tail amputation may be required; in one study, tail amputation alone was 80 percent successful in preventing recurrence. If the anal glands are involved in the fistulae, they will have to be removed. In milder cases, chemical cauterization of fistulae (which destroys abnormal tissue and allows normal tissue to heal in) may be helpful. Cryotherapy, where a freezing agent is used instead of a chemical one, has been less effective (more scarring, less control over the area treated, etc.) Laser therapy, on the other hand, has been 95 percent successful in preventing recurrence and controlling pain (20 percent of patients developed fecal incontinence but most of these cases were controlled with diet). The more extensive the surgery, the more the potential for complications. Stool softeners are typically needed for a month after surgery and the owner should be comfortable cleaning the anal area. Fecal incontinence narrowed anus, and inability to control the fistulation are the chief complications with surgery.

Category: Prophylactic Gastropexy in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  Commonly referred to asvolvulus,bloat, gastric dilatation, or gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV), is an often fatal emergency that causes the dog’s stomach to distend and twist. Two main risk factors for GDV areanxiety anda dog's body shape. GDV can happen to any breed of dog but tends to occur in deep, barrel-chested dogs such as Great Danes, St. Bernards, greyhounds, German Shepherds, Weimaraners, boxers, etc. Great Danes have the highest lifetime risk at about 40%. When gas and food distend (stretch) the dog’s stomach to several times its normal size, the dilated (distended) stomach usually rotates. We don’t know why it twists, but it can rotate anywhere from 90° to 360° degrees (essentially from one-quarter of a circle to all the way around). When it is twisted shut, it is like a balloon tied off with a knot: unless the balloon pops, nothing is getting out. Whatever is in the stomach(food, water, gas)cannot move into the intestines. The distended stomach crushes major blood vessels in the abdomen. Without treatment, a dog with GDV will experience significant pain and diewithin hours(it’s not the same time frame for every dog). For those owners who choose not to go with surgery to correct the GDV, the decision to euthanize must be made quickly because of the pain the dog is experiencing.   Gastric dilatation and volvulus(GDV)is an emergency that requires surgery and hospitalization or euthanasia. What is Prophylactic Gastropexy? An elective surgical procedure called prophylactic (or preventative) gastropexy (tacking) prevents GDV. In deep-chested dogs or those whose adult weight is expected to reach over 99 pounds (45 kg) this preventive surgery that permanently attaches (tacks) their stomachs to the body wall is often done when a dog is being spayed or neutered, or another surgery is taking place where the abdomen is being explored already. Gastropexy can be done when the dog is six months or older. It also can be an elective procedure on its own, or it can be done as part of treatment at the emergency room during an episode of GDV. Types of Prophylactic Gastropexy Prophylactic gastropexy is performed by a veterinary surgeon. Two incisions are made in the body wall, where the stomach is to be tacked, at the same spot from both the outside and inside. Sutures attach the stomach to the body wall at this spot. The scar tissue created from the two incisions will hold the stomach in place. Laparoscopic and endoscopic gastropexies are also possible and tend to heal faster than the method described above, but they require specialized equipment that may be available only at specialty hospitals. Laparoscopic gastropexy involves inserting instruments and a camera through two small incisions in the body wall. The endoscopic approach inserts the instruments and a camera through the mouth and esophagus into the stomach and needs only one incision. The laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures are less invasive and take less time to heal (around two weeks), so they are often used on working dogs such as police or military dogs that need to be back in action as quickly as possible. These procedures also shorten the time the dog is under anesthesia.  What Happens After Gastropexy Surgery? Excess gas can still be a problem, but tacking significantly reduces the stomach’s ability to twist. If the stomach becomes distended, it’s unpleasant and painful but not fatal. Unfortunately, the preventive procedure is not a complete guarantee that the dog will never have a twisted stomach, but with gastropexy surgery, the possibility of twisting drops to approximately 6%.   Elective vs. Emergency Prophylactic Gastropexy - Aftercare and Outlook Aftercare for preventive surgery is relatively simple. Post-operative care is essentially the same as an ovariohysterectomy (spay), and instructions will be to keep the dog calm and leashed for seven days. Do not let the dog jump or run, and keep the incision dry. A prophylactic gastropexy can be done in dogs whose owners plan on doing competitive agility. Some agility handlers have worried that the strenuous activity of agility will break down the tacking, but there have been no studies or patient case reports that indicate that. Activity or breeding will not make the tacked stomach any less effective. Surgery in an emergency setting requires more aftercare but depends on the dog’s case. Most patients will stay in the hospital for a few days. Their diet might need to be changed along with the usual post-operative care. In dogs with GDV, gastropexy reduces recurrence to less than 5%, while not doing one results in recurrence rates as high as 80%. A risk vs. benefit study calculated the lifetime risk of bloat and its medical treatment. The study found preventive surgery made sense for at-risk breeds, especially Great Danes. If your dog is not a predisposed breed or mixed breed and does not have other risk factors for GDV, you can discuss with your veterinarian if a prophylactic gastropexy is advised/necessary. If you do have a large breed dog and/or other risk factors and have concerns about bloat, talk with your veterinarian about the potential benefits and risks of gastropexy to see if it is a good option for your dog.

Category: Umbilical Hernias in Puppies and Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An umbilical hernia is a condition in which abdominal contents (fat, intestines, etc.) protrude past the abdominal wall at the location where the umbilical cord was attached to the fetus. Congenital umbilical hernias are more common in puppies than in kittens. The umbilicus, or belly button, is where the umbilical cord attaches when the puppy or kitten is in the womb. The umbilical cord carries nutrition and oxygen from the mother to the fetus, and waste products and carbon dioxide from the fetus to the mother. Normally, after the puppy or kitten is born, the cord breaks, and the connection at the umbilicus closes up. An umbilical hernia occurs when the hole doesn’t close correctly. When this happens, skin is the only barrier between the abdominal organs and the environment. Umbilical hernias are diagnosed on physical examination. Small hernias do not usually cause any problems, and are often left untreated. Large hernias should be repaired surgically, because there is a risk that the abdominal contents inside the hernia sac could become damaged or strangulated. Strangulation of intestinal loops can cause blood flow restriction to the intestine, intestinal blockage, etc. Strangulated hernias can become life-threatening; signs can include a large, warm hernia sac; vomiting; abdominal pain; lack of appetite; and depression. Radiography or ultrasonography may be necessary to help diagnose a strangulated hernia. As long as the hernia isn’t causing problems for the puppy/kitten, the herniorrhaphy (hernioplasty, hernia repair surgery) can be delayed until the scheduled ovariohysterectomy or neuter. However, if strangulation occurs, the surgery becomes an emergency procedure. The exact cause of congenital umbilical hernias is unknown, but it is generally thought to be a hereditary condition.

Category: Ear Infections (Gram Negative Otitis) In Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English You do not have permission to view this document: [8621382]! The Gram negative ear infection is a special situation because Gram negative bacteria (so named because they do not take up Gram stain when viewed under the microscope), tend to have unpredictable antibiotic profiles. This means we cannot simply pick a general ear product off the shelf; we will need to culture what is in the ear in order to get the right antibiotic. Worse still, Gram negative bacteria are especially talented at changing their antibiotic sensitivity so every time we guess wrong on the antibiotic, Gram negative bacteria become resistant to multiple additional antibiotics. This is how the superbugs we periodically read about in the news come to be. It isn’t long before the pet is seen scratching at his ears, shaking his head or holding one ear slightly dropped. Discharge and odor may be noticeable to the owner.More on onPseudomonasInfection Gram negative rods appear pink after Gram staining and, as mentioned, they tend to be more resistant to antibiotics than Gram positive (blue-staining) bacteria. A particularly heinous bacterial species is almost always resistant to most conventional antibiotics from the beginning, and it deserves special mention:Pseudomonas aeruginosa.When ear cytology samples reveal a Gram negative infection, culture is recommended as treatment forPseudomonasbut must be definitive.Pseudomonasshould be identified as soon as possible. You might wonder how such a difficult bacterium comes to be in a given ear. Sometimes a dog is just unlucky but oftenPseudomonasinfection happens in ears that have been treated repeatedly for ear infections in the past. The unfortunate tendency is for normal ear bacteria to be killed off with each treatment course leaving only the most resistant bacteria to colonize the ear canal. Pseudomonas readily grows and prospers where less resistant bacteria have been cleared. If you are lucky, a culture of the discharge will reveal that thePseudomonasis still sensitive to a quinolone antibiotics such asenrofloxacin,marbofloxacin, ororbifloxacin. It should be noted that especially high doses of this type of antibiotic are needed to treatPseudomonasin the ear and that inadequate dosing will just makePseudomonaseven more resistant. Therapy must be decisive. If you are not as lucky, the culture may show there are no effective oral antibiotics or possibly no antibiotics at all that will be effective. In this situation, disinfectant rinses may be the only choice. Oral therapy (pills), if culture indicates it is likely to work, is generally combined with some kind of topical treatment. This may involve a commercial product, combination of products, or even a concoction your veterinarian mixes up. Complications of Gram Negative Ear Infection Aural HematomaWhen a dog with uncomfortable ears shakes and scratches vigorously, a blood vessel in the earflap may rupture. This leads to bleeding into the tissues of the pinna (see above illustration). The usual recommendation is to have the blood clots removed and the ear bandaged and cleaned under anesthesia. If the hematoma is not so big as to occlude the ear canal (thus preventing medication of the ear canal), the option to forgo surgery exists; but without surgery, the ear may scar down into an abnormal appearance. Middle Ear InfectionA routine ear infection is uncomfortable enough but if the infection persists, it can become an even bigger problem. The infection can lead to proliferation and scarring in the canal which makes the infection especially difficult (and potentially impossible) to clear up. The ear canal may mineralize and the middle ear may come to be involved, leading to nerve damage. Affected animals may have a head tilt, a lack of balance, and unusual back-and-forth eye movements (called nystagmus.) These symptoms are called vestibular signs and are a complication of middle ear infection. Middle ear infections can also cause paralysis of the facial nerve, leading to a slack-jawed appearance on that side of the face. Severe cases may require surgical intervention to remove the vertical portion of the ear canal (lateral ear resection) or even remove and seal the ear canal (ear canal ablation). It is important to control ear infections before they reach this stage if at all possible. Treatment Level One: The Simple Ear InfectionsMost ear infections are cleared up simply with professional cleaning followed by medication at home. If only mild debris is present in the ear canals, simple disinfection and washing of the ear is adequate; however, in many cases, a full ear flush is needed to even examine the eardrum. For patient comfort, we recommend sedation for this procedure as the ears are sore and the instruments can be damaging if the pet jumps at the wrong time. A sample of ear discharge is commonly examined under the microscope so as to assist in selecting medications for home use. After a couple of weeks of home treatment, the ear canals are rechecked to be sure the infection is gone. In most cases this completes treatment but for stubborn cases, we must proceed to the next step. Level Two: On-Going Ear InfectionsSome dogs have chronic ear problems (the infection is not controlled by general medication or returns when general medication is discontinued). In these cases, the ear discharge should be cultured so that the precise organism can be pinpointed and treated specifically. Regular treatment at home with disinfecting ear washes should become part of the pet's grooming routine. Further testing may be in order to determine why the infection continues to recur. Allergy is the most common reason for recurrent ear problems but hormone imbalances can also be underlying causes. Level Three: The End-Stage EarSome ear infections simply cannot be controlled with the above steps. These cases have transcended medical management and must proceed to surgical management. What this entails will depend on the state of the ear canal. Your veterinarian will make recommendations accordingly. Ear infections are common and can be challenging. Fortunately, most cases are simple and easily cleared up. Be sure to recheck the ears as your veterinarian recommends as premature discontinuance of treatment can lead to a continuing infection. Gram negative ear infections do not have the same kind of leeway that other ear infections do. It is crucial that recheck appointments are not skipped because Gram negatives will simply get harder to clear if treatment is incomplete. Your veterinarian will need to confirm that the infection is resolved fully before medication can be withdrawn.

Category: Ear Infections (Otitis) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dogs seem to get ear infections with a surprising frequency, and some dogs have to deal with ear infections nearly constantly. When one considers that human ear infections seem few and far between, one wonders how man's best friend came to be so unlucky. It turns out there are a couple of factors at work: the shape of the ear canal and the common frequency of conditions leading to excess ear wax. The first problem for the dog's ear is structural. As demonstrated by the above illustration, the dog's ear canal has a vertical and a horizontal component, unlike the human ear canal, which goes straight in. This "J" shape of the dog's ear creates a predisposition to ear infections as debris must work its way upward rather than straight out. If ear wax cannot get out, it accumulates. Accumulation of ear wax, skin oil, and other debris feeds the bacteria and fungi that live in the normal ear canal, allowing their numbers to grow quickly. Soon, an infection results. Anything that facilitates ear wax accumulation sets the stage for ear infection. It might be the narrowed ear opening of the Shar pei further hampering ear drainage, irritation from water in the ear canal after a bath, or actual disease-causing over-production of ear wax. Allergic skin disease affecting the ears is the most common cause for recurring increased ear wax production/ear infection; other causes of ear infections includeear mites, foreign bodies in the ear (such asgrass awns or foxtails), or hair growth deep in the canal (common in poodles and schnauzers especially). The moisture of the wax promotes bacterial growth, rapid growth of yeast, and perhaps even pus development. It isn’t long before the pet is seen scratching at his ears, shaking his head, or holding one ear slightly dropped. Discharge and odor may be noticeable to you.

Severe cases may require surgical intervention to remove the vertical portion of the ear canal (lateral ear resection) or even remove and seal the ear canal (ear canal ablation). It is important to control ear infections before they reach this stage if at all possible. Aural Hematoma When a dog with uncomfortable ears shakes and scratches vigorously, a blood vessel in the earflap may rupture. This leads to bleeding into the tissues of the pinna (ear flap). The usual recommendation is to have theblood clots removedand the ear bandaged and cleaned under anesthesia. If the hematoma is not so big as to occlude the ear canal (thus preventing medication of the ear canal), the option to forgo surgery exists, but without surgery, the ear may scar down into an abnormal appearance. Ear infections are common and can be challenging. Fortunately, most cases are simple and easily cleared up. Be sure to recheck the ears as your veterinarian recommends, as premature discontinuance of treatment can lead to continuing infection.

Category: Ear Infections (Yeast Otitis) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Yeast infection is the most common type of ear infection in dogs. The yeast organisms are fungi calledMalasseziapachydermatisand they are normal on the skin and in the ears. When the ear becomes inflamed and the canal environment changes, the yeast overgrow and create a brown or gray, greasy ear discharge. It is especially itchy and somewhat smelly. It isn’t long before the pet is seen scratching at his ears, shaking his head, or holding one ear slightly dropped. Discharge and odor may be noticeable to the owner. Yeast overgrowth can have many underlying causes but allergy is particularly common. If the ear infection involves the ear flap or entrance to the ear canal rather than the canal itself, this is a hint that allergy is at the root of the problem. In these patients, ear infections are often recurrent and accompanied by other skin disease. Regular ear washes at home are frequently needed to disinfect the ear and control the recurrent inflammation. Some primary, or underlying, causes of ear infection include allergies (atopic dermatitis or food hypersensitivity) and narrowed ear canals. Studies have shown that bacteria can be found in combination with a Malassezia otitis. Treatment Level One: The Simple Ear InfectionsMost ear infections are cleared up simply with professional cleaning followed by medication at home. If only mild debris is present in the ear canals, simple disinfection and washing of the ear is adequate; however, in many cases, a full ear flush is needed to even examine the eardrum. For patient comfort, we recommend sedation for this procedure as the ears are sore and the instruments can be damaging if the pet jumps at the wrong time. A sample of ear discharge is commonly examined under the microscope so as to assist in selecting medications for home use. After a couple of weeks of home treatment, the ear canals are rechecked to be sure the infection is gone. In most cases this completes treatment but for stubborn cases, we must proceed to the next step. Level Two: On-Going Ear InfectionsSome dogs have chronic ear problems (the infection is not controlled by general medication or returns when general medication is discontinued). In these cases, the ear discharge should be cultured so that the precise organism can be pinpointed and treated specifically. Regular treatment at home with disinfecting ear washes should become part of the pet's grooming routine. Further testing may be in order to determine why the infection continues to recur. Allergy is the most common reason for recurrent ear problems but hormone imbalances can also be underlying causes. Level Three: The End-Stage EarSome ear infections simply cannot be controlled with the above steps. These cases have transcended medical management and must proceed to surgical management. What this entails will depend on the state of the ear canal. Your veterinarian will make recommendations accordingly. Ear infections are common and can be challenging. Fortunately, most cases are simple and easily cleared up. Be sure to recheck the ears as your veterinarian recommends because ending treatment early can lead to a continuing infection. Complications of Yeast Ear Infection Aural HematomaWhen a dog with uncomfortable ears shakes and scratches vigorously, a blood vessel in the earflap may rupture. This leads to bleeding into the tissues of the pinna (ear flap). The usual recommendation is to have the blood clots removed and the ear bandaged and cleaned under anesthesia. If the hematoma is not so big as to occlude the ear canal (thus preventing medication of the ear canal), the option toforgo surgeryexists; but without surgery, the ear may scar down into an abnormal appearance. Proliferative Ear Canal Change and Middle Ear InfectionA routine ear infection is uncomfortable enough but if the infection persists, it can become an even bigger problem. The infection can lead to proliferation and scarring in the canal which makes the infection especially difficult (and potentially impossible) to clear up. Yeast organisms are joined by resistant bacteria and the infection becomes even more difficult to address. The ear canal may mineralize and the middle ear may come to be involved, leading to nerve damage. Affected animals may have a head tilt, a lack of balance, and unusual back-and-forth eye movements (called “nystagmus.”) These symptoms are called vestibular signs”and are a complication of middle ear infection. Middle ear infections can also cause paralysis of the facial nerve, leading to a slack-jawed appearance on that side of the face. Severe cases may require surgical intervention to remove the vertical portion of the ear canal (lateral ear resection)  or even remove and seal the ear canal (ear canalablation).

Category: Lateral Ear Resection in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Zepp and Lacroix Procedures The occasional ear infection is a nuisance but at least it can be expected to resolve in two to four weeks, leaving the patient to resume a normal life. Chronic ear infection can be recurring or on-going. It can lead to dizzying middle ear infections, unending headaches and pain, as well as permeating foul odor. There comes a point when simply managing the infection with cleaning solutions and oral medications is not enough and surgery must be considered. There are two techniques commonly used to benefit the patient with chronic otitis: the lateral ear resection and thetotal ear canal ablation. The lateral ear resection is the more conservative approach meant for ears not yet at their end-stage where it is thought that more efficient cleaning and better canal ventilation will help. How the Surgery Works The ear canal of dogs and cats consists of both a vertical portion and a horizontal portion, making a J-shaped ear canal (darker line in above diagram). This configuration is different from the human horizontal-only canal, which goes straight into the head. Because of the vertical portion that dogs and cats have, it is thought that infectious debris and wax have a harder time draining and that this is an important factor in why dogs and cats have so many ear infections relative to humans. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could get rid of the vertical ear canal and only contend with a horizontal ear canal? Well, it turns out that we can. The lateral ear resection cuts the vertical canal in half lengthwise down to where the canal turns horizontal. In the Zepp procedure, one version of the lateral ear resection, skin is removed from the area on the outside of (or lateral to) the ear so that the dissected half of the ear canal can be folded down to form a drain board. In the LaCroix procedure, the outer (lateral) part of the vertical canal is simply removed and the new ear opening is formed from the tissue in the area. The result either way creates an ear opening that is more like the human ear opening: straight in. The ear can be more easily cleaned and since ventilation is now better, the canal is less suited to incubate bacteria. This procedure is relatively simple. Post-operative care after lateral ear resection includes the use of an Elizabethan collar to protect the delicate incisions from scratching. This is worn for 10 to 14 days at which time any external sutures can be removed. Aftercare The ear will still require treatment of its infection so topical and oral medication will continue to be used. The Caveats Before calling up your veterinarian’s office to schedule this procedure, there are a few facts to be aware of.  The last thing you want to do is put your pet through an ear surgery only to find you should have done a different surgery. The Lateral Ear Resection is right for selected cases as described and would be totally useless for other patients. Be sure to discuss all the ear surgery options with your veterinarian and what diagnostics would be useful in helping with this selection. The goal is for your pet to finally gain relief from long-standing ear discomfort.

Category: Swimmer's Ear in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Summer has officially hit the northern hemisphere. People are slathering on sunscreen and squeezing into their swimsuits. Sometimes they hit the beach with their dogs. After a long day of swimming, most people recognize the all too familiar symptoms of the dreaded swimmer's ear. Pain, itchiness or even burning may be the first signs that our ears will be protesting the water tomorrow. If a few drying ear drops and ibuprofen don’t kick this pain in the butt (or ear), then it’s poolside fun only tomorrow.Dogs can also suffer from swimmer’s ear. They can’t tell us that their ears feel like a 10-ton weight is inside their ear canal, but they will display clinical signs consistent with swimmer’s ear such as head shaking, pawing at the head/ears, rubbing ears on objects, and twitching of the ears. Sometimes they may whine or be restless.So what causes some people and dogs to develop swimmer’s ears while other water lovers go unscathed?Swimmer’s ear is another term to describe inflammation in the outer ear canal (otitis externa) which is the part of the ear canal extending from the ear drum to the outside of the ear. The condition develops when water contaminated with bacteria is trapped in the ear canal for a long period of time. If the body’s immune system, its natural defense system, does not attack and kill the bacteria, then they will invade and cause inflammation. The trapped water combined with the warm, dark environment of the ear canal is the perfect brewing pot for bacteria. Swimmer's ear can be mild or severe, and it may require professional medical intervention to cure.Swimmer’s ear is commonly misdiagnosed in dogs that frequently develop ear infections after swimming or being bathed. Because most dogs that swim do not go on to develop ear infections, there usually is something unique about the dogs that do. Take one of my favorite allergic Labrador retrievers, Remy, for example. Helovesto swim in his owner’s pool during the hot summer months. I can guarantee that at least once each summer the combination of high pollen counts and daily dips in the pool will land him a lovely ear infection requiring medical intervention. But why doesn’t every Labrador retriever develop an ear infection after a single day of swimming? Man if they did, I would never go out of business!So what is different about Remy and dogs like him? Usually they have some underlying condition that causes them to develop ear infections after swimming. The most common reason for this is an underlying allergy (environmental allergy/atopy andfood allergy). Remy is allergic to grasses, trees and weeds. He suffers from increased itchiness and redness of the skin, paws and ears starting every spring extending well into the fall months. Other conditions that can cause ear infections include parasites, endocrine disorders, systemic immune-suppressive disorders, and tumors in the ear canal. These primary conditions cause underlying inflammation and/or bacterial overgrowth in the ear canals. When water enters the ear canal during swimming, the moisture level increases and these normal doggie bacteria and inflammation worsen leading to signs of an ear infection. In other words, the increased water in the ear canal predisposes your dog’s infection-primed ear to do what it does best – get stanky!The best way to know if your dog has swimmer’s ear (bacteria-contaminated water causing inflammation) versus an ear infection due to some other cause (such as allergies) is to monitor for trends. Does your dog have ear infections at times when not swimming? Does your dog have an increased itch level compared to normal dogs? Has your dog suffered from bacterial skin infections too? If you answeredyes, then your dog is not suffering from swimmer’s ear. If you are not sure, chat with your veterinarian to see if they can help to identify trends.Worst case scenario:stop swimming!If the inflammation goes away, then presto! But I'd be greatly surprised if you can keep your water-loving dog from diving head first off the dock. You might consider wearing a life jacket and pair of water skis because you’ll be getting al  wet!As for Remy, we have found a good management protocol for his environmental allergies usingallergen-specific immunotherapy injectionscombined with routine ear flushes to keep those bacteria and yeast from over-growing during his Olympic swim team training seasons. He is happy and healthy, swimming his summers away.Speak with your veterinarian about ways to help prevent swimmer’s ear flare-ups. Just as in people, we can use ear flushes and drying ear drops to help keep this pesky condition from inhibiting your summer fun!P.S. – don’t forget that dogs can getsunburnedtoo!

Category: Addison's Disease (Hypoadrenocorticism)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Adrenal Hormones The adrenal gland is so named because it is located just forward of the kidney (renal means kidney). The center of the gland is called the medulla and the outer area is the cortex. While both areas produce hormones, Addison's disease concerns the hormones produced by the cortex; these hormones are called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are the hormones that enable us to adapt physiologically to stress. The glucocorticoids (such as cortisol and related synthetics,prednisone,dexamethasone,and numerous others) act on the mechanics of sugar, fat, and protein metabolism. They gear the metabolism towards the preparation of burning, rather than storing, fuels so as to be ready for a fight or flight situation. The mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone and related synthetics,fludrocortisone acetate, and desoxycorticosterone pivalate) influence the electrolytes sodium and potassium. You may wonder what electrolytes have to do with fight or flight but it is important to remember that where there is sodium (salt), water soon follows. Conserving sodium will pull water from other tissues and bring it into circulation ready to support blood pressure should a life-threatening bleed occur. The mineralocorticoid hormones instruct the kidney to retain sodium so that the circulatory changes of stress can be handled smoothly. As sodium is retained, potassium is lost in the exchange. Corticosteroid hormones are needed to adapt to stressful situations and without these hormones, even small stresses could lead to physiologic disaster. Hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's Disease) is a Deficiency in Corticosteroid Hormones In animals with Addison's disease, there is a deficiency of corticosteroid hormones. There are several reasons why this might happen: the adrenal gland might be damaged or drugs may be involved. We usually never find out what caused an individual patient's Addison's disease but the good news is that we don't need to know why it happened. Treatment is straightforward: we simply provide the hormones that the body is not making on its own. Clinical Signs Patients are usually young (age four to five years) but any age dog can be affected. (This disease can occur in cats but is very rare.) There is a genetic predisposition for Addison's disease in the standard poodle and bearded collie, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, and Portuguese water dog. Female dogs are affected twice as often as males. At first, signs may be vague: listlessness, possibly some vomiting, or diarrhea. The dog just does not seem to feel right but not in an obvious way and may seem more or less normal most of the time as symptoms wax and wane with stress. This vague waxing and waning go on and on with the dog never really getting fully sick but never staying well either. Eventually, if the disease is not diagnosed, it can come to a head in a phenomenon known as an Addisonian crisis. The animal collapses in shock due to an inability to adapt to the caloric and circulatory requirements of stress. Blood sugar may drop dangerously low. Potassium levels can soar and disrupt the heart. Heart rate slows and arrhythmias result. The patient may not survive this episode. About 30% of dogs with Addison's diseaseare diagnosed at the time of an Addisonian crisis.Approximately 90% of the adrenal cortex must benon-functional before clinical signs are observed. Making the Diagnosis Because of the numerous symptoms Addison’s disease can present with, Addison’s disease has earned the medical nickname “The Great Imitator.” One would think that one could simply look for an increase in potassium and/or a drop in sodium on a basic laboratory blood panel, but it turns out spot checks of electrolyte values like this are not reliable enough for a diagnosis of Addison's disease. Shock Veterinarians can be presented with a young animal in shock. There is usually no history of trauma or toxic exposure so general treatment for shock is initiated. This consists of rapid administration of fluids (usually Lactated Ringers solution which has little potassium and a moderate amount of sodium) plus some glucocorticoids. By coincidence, this also happens to be similar to the specific treatment for Addison's disease so often the patient simply recovers without the veterinarian really knowing why. Imitating Kidney Disease The blood panel often comes back showing elevations in the renal parameters (BUN and creatinine), and, thus the elevated potassium is suggestive of acute renal failure, a condition with an extremely poor prognosis. The veterinarian may become suspicious of another diagnosis as the patient will respond well to fluid administration and most renal failure patients do not respond as well. Low Blood Sugar Addison’s disease may present in more unusual ways. The inability to maintain normal sugar levels (ultimately manifesting as aseizure disorder) may be strongly suggestive of aninsulin-secreting pancreatic tumorbut before major abdominal surgery is planned, it is important to test for Addison’s disease. Megaesophagus or Recurring GI Disease In a similarly unexpected way, regurgitation of undigested food due to abnormal nerve function in the esophagus (a condition calledmegaesophagus) can be caused ultimately by Addison’s disease. Megaesophagus has many causes but it is important not to forget Addison's disease. Of course, Addison's disease can also manifest with chronic waxing/waning diarrhea and/or poor appetite which would suggest a gastrointestinal problem such asinflammatory bowel disease. Before investing in the expense and potential anesthetic risk for endoscopy and intestinal biopsy, a screening test to rule out Addison's disease is prudent. Sorting it out with the ACTH Stimulation Test Your veterinarian may use a resting cortisol test to rule out Addison's but the only definitive test for Addison's disease is the ACTH stimulation test. The patient receives a dose of ACTH, the pituitary hormone responsible for the release of corticosteroids in times of stress. A normal animal will show an elevation in cortisol in response to ACTH while an Addisonian has no corticosteroids to respond with. This lack of response is diagnostic for Addison's disease; however, a false positive may be obtained if corticosteroids have been used in the treatment of the crisis prior to the test. Of all the commonly used corticosteroids, only dexamethasone does not interfere with the assay for cortisol; if any other steroid has been used, the test will not be valid for at least 24 hours. Treatment The most important aspect of treatment for hypoadrenocorticism is replacing the missing mineralocorticoid hormones. One way to do this is with oralfludrocortisone (brand name Florinef®).Fludrocortisone is given twice a day at a dose determined by the patient's sodium and potassium blood tests. At first, these electrolytes are monitored weekly. When levels seem stable, these blood tests are repeated two to four times per year. Often with time, it will be found that the fludrocortisone dose needed will increase. This increase is unfortunate as the medication is relatively expensive. Since fludrocortisone has glucocorticoid activity as well as mineralocorticoid activity, only 50% of patients need to receive additional glucocorticoids. Using acompounding pharmacyor looking into the cost of generic fludrocortisone may be helpful in managing the costs of this particular medication, especially in a larger dog. Another way to treat this condition is with an injectable medication called DOCP desoxycorticosterone pivalate, (brand names Percorten-V or Zycortal®). This treatment is given approximately every 25 days. Electrolytes are measured prior to injections at first but testing can usually eventually be tapered to once or twice a year. There is some feeling among experts that DOCP produces better regulation of electrolytes than oral Florinef. Dogs on DOCP, however, do require glucocorticoid supplementation (such as a low dose ofprednisone). What is Atypical Addison's Disease? Most dogs become Addisonian when they lose the ability to produce both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. They need both types of hormones replaced. It turns out that there is a subset of Addisonian dogs that are able to control their sodium/potassium imbalance and only the glucocorticoids need to be supplemented. These patients have what is called atypical Addison's disease. They can have all of the symptoms of typical Addison's as described above (chronic relapsing diarrhea/appetite loss, low blood sugar crisis etc.) but not the electrolyte abnormalities. Treatment is supplementing with glucocorticoid hormones, such as prednisone. Atypical Addison's patients can progress to the typical form, which means they will eventually need more aggressive treatment with fludrocortisone tablets or DOCP injections. The current recommendation is to monitor sodium and potassium levels every couple of months in atypical patients for up to one year, to watch for the switch to the typical (and more serious) form of Addison's disease. Becoming atypical Addison’s can still occur after one year. If an atypical Addisonian patient becomes ill, sodium and potassium should be checked to see if they have progressed to the typical form. What is Secondary Addison's Disease? Addison’s disease is most often caused by the destruction of the adrenal glands.  In some cases, the problem is a failure of the pituitary gland.  ACTH is a hormone made by the pituitary that tells the adrenal glands to produce and release more glucocorticoids.  Without ACTH, the adrenal glands atrophy and stop producing glucocorticoids.  Measuring the hormone ACTH in the blood can distinguish adrenal and pituitary failure.  This is not simply of academic interest.  A patient with secondary Addison’s disease (i.e., pituitary failure) will never progress to typical Addison’s disease and does not require long-term, periodic monitoring of electrolytes. What is Pacific Rimism? Dog breeds originating in the Pacific Rim, such as the Akita and Shiba Inu, commonly have elevated potassium levels on blood tests. This can be confusing when a patient has symptoms that suggest Addison's. These patients will have normal ACTH stimulation test results if they do not have Addison's disease. Whipworm Infection? Whipworminfection has been known to create a syndrome nearly identical to Addisonian crisis, complete with abnormal sodium and potassium values. These patients will have normal ACTH stimulation tests but because whipworms only periodically shed eggs, fecal testing may not detect whipworm infection. If there is any question about whipworm infection, treatment should be instituted.

Category: Adrenal Tumor Treatment in Cushing's Syndrome
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Let's assume an adrenal tumor has been confirmed with either blood testing, imaging, or both. Two questions must be answered next: Benign vs. Malignant While only approximately 15% of canine Cushing’s syndrome patients have adrenal tumors, half of them will have benign tumors and half will have malignant ones. The choice of therapy may well depend on which one the patient has. If imaging has not yet been performed, this is the time to do so. Chest radiographs will be important as malignant adrenal tumors tend to spread to the chest. If such spread is seen, the tumor can be assumed to be malignant. Absence of such findings, however, does not mean the tumor is benign. Ultrasound of the abdomen, if this has not already been done, (or even CT scanning, MRI imaging, or nuclear medicine scanning) will be needed to determine the size of the tumor, and to check for invasion of local abdominal tissues (especially in the liver). Between evaluation of the chest and the abdomen, it may be possible to non-invasively determine if the tumor is malignant. It should be noted that the absence of tumor spread does not mean that the tumor is benign. If there is obvious spread to other organs, medical management is the only meaningful hope for the patient. Discuss with your veterinarian whether a referral to an oncologist for the most current medication plan is in your pet's best interest. What if Imaging Fails to Confirm That the Tumor Is Malignant? As mentioned, it is not possible to say that the tumor is benign simply because tumor spread has not been detected. Still, no evidence of spread is about as close to determining that the tumor is benign as we can get without actually obtaining tissue samples. If the adrenal tumor is benign, there is an excellent chance for complete recovery if the tumor is surgically removed. The smaller the tumor, the easier the surgery, though the surgery involves delicate tissue in a difficult area. What if Imaging Indicates the Tumor Is Malignant? If there is obvious tumor spread, surgery may be too risky. The decision to proceed with medical therapy will depend on how debilitated the patient is, and the degree of tumor spread versus the severity of the clinical signs of Cushing's disease. Relief, but not cure, of the clinical signs may be achieved by removing part of the tumor. Medical management with trilostane or with high doses of lysodren would be fair alternatives. What You Should Know About Surgery Medical Therapy for the Adrenal Tumor As can be seen from the above discussion, adrenalectomy is a high-risk surgery. It may not be a good choice for an elderly debilitated patient, especially if the tumor is large or has evidence of spread. Further, a 24-hour specialty center is usually needed for this sophisticated procedure and these centers may not be accessible, plus there is a great deal of expense involved in a surgical adventure of this magnitude. For these reasons, medical management may be selected as an alternative. Lysodren is a chemotherapy drugthat is able to erode the cortisol-producing layers of the adrenal gland. This ability has made lysodren, for decades the traditional medication for treating pituitary Cushing’s disease, helpful in treating adrenal tumors as well. It turns out the adrenal tumors will respond to higher doses, The higher doses needed to control adrenal tumors tend to produce more lysodren reactions than are seen when treating pituitary tumors. The average survival time for this type of therapy is 16 months. Trilostane can also be used for functioning adrenal tumors though it will not actually diminish adrenal tissue (which could potentially diminish the tumor). Trilostane acts by inactivating excess steroid hormones and thereby managing the symptoms of Cushing's disease. You would think that this would not be effective since it does not directly affect the tumor, but at least one study showed a comparable survival time to that of patients on lysodren. As with lysodren, a protocol is needed that is different from those using the same drugs to treat pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease. Something Different: Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy A study presented in 2014 by a group of Italian researchers treated 12 dogs with adrenal tumors with this special type of radiotherapy and all 12 of them responded. After 12 months, 11 patients were not only still alive but their Cushing's syndromes were controlled as well (the 12th patient had died of unrelated causes). This type of therapy was considered to be far less risky than surgery and the researchers recommended further investigation. Stereotactic radiotherapy involves highly specialized equipment and is not readily available but might be worth travel depending on where it might be located. An oncologist should be consulted for more information.

Category: Cataracts in Diabetic Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Most diabetic dogs will develop cataracts and go blind. This FAQ is designed to assist the owners of diabetic dogs in knowing what to expect and to make decisions regarding cataract surgery. What Is a Cataract? A cataract is an opacity in the lens of the eye. The entire lens may be involved or just a part of it. The patient will not be able to see through the opacity. Why Do Diabetic Dogs Get Cataracts? The lens of the eye is round, hard, and normally as clear as glass. Looking at the lens, it is hard to believe it is a piece of living tissue. The lens is suspended by fibers that can adjust its position so that one can focus vision. The lens is encased in a capsule and depends on the fluids of the eye for nutrients. The lens does not receive a direct blood supply. Normally, the lens absorbs glucose from the eye fluids, using most of this for its own energy needs. Some of the excess is converted to another sugar called sorbitol. When there is excess sugar in the eye fluids, as in diabetes mellitus, there is excess sorbitol produced. Sorbitol pulls water into the lens, which in turn disrupts lens clarity and causes the cataract. Fructose is also produced from the excess glucose and also contributes to this water absorption. Cataracts do not necessarily imply poor diabetic control. Even well-controlled dogs can still get cataracts. How Long Does It Take To Go Blind? Generally, the cataract has matured, and the dog is blind in a matter of weeks. Until recently, blindness in a diabetic dog was basically a foregone conclusion, but there is a new product calledKinostat®that has changed that outlook. To review, the lens absorbs glucose from the fluids of the eye and uses this glucose as nutrition. Any extra glucose that is absorbed into the lens is converted to sorbitol by an enzyme called aldose reductase. Sorbitol pulls water into the lens to prevent the lens from becoming dehydrated. This is all well and good, but in the diabetic state, there is lots of excess glucose, and the excess glucose gets converted to excess sorbitol, which, in turn, pulls so much water into the lens that clarity and function are disrupted, and a cataract is formed. Kinostat is an aldose reductase inhibitor that curtails sorbitol production. Early use of Kinostat may significantly delay or even completely prevent the development of cataracts. Kinostat is preventive only and will not reverse cataract formation that has already occurred. Kinostat is unfortunately not yet commercially available, though has been reportedly near coming to market for some time. What Does It Mean To Say That a Cataract Is Mature? A cataract’s maturity is determined by how much visual impairment the pet is believed to have. Since we cannot ask a dog to read an eye chart, we must determine this by visually inspecting the eye. A light is used to look into the eye and view the colorful area at the back of the eye called the tapetum. (This is the area that flashes or appears colored in certain lighting.) When less than 10 percent of the tapetum is obstructed, the cataract is very young and does not significantly change vision. When 10-50 percent of the tapetum is obstructed, this cataract is called early immature. When 51-99 percent is obstructed the cataract is late immature. The mature cataract obstructs the entire tapetum. Ideally, a cataract is removed in the early immature stage for the lowest surgical complication rate. When a cataract is hypermature, it starts to liquefy and dissolve. This can actually lead to restoring vision, which sounds like a positive turn of events; unfortunately, the dissolution process is quite inflammatory. The resulting inflammation can be painful and can damage the eye even more. All cataracts do not progress all the way to hypermature and may stay static or progress at changing rates; however, diabetic cataracts are notorious for reaching hypermaturity and creating inflammation. What Is Uveitis? Uveitis is inflammation of the eye's uveal tract, which consists of the eye's vascular tissues. In this situation, uveitis is the inflammation that results when the hypermature cataract begins to liquefy. Uveitis is painful and tends to cause the eye to become reddened and the pupil to constrict. When a pet has uveitis before surgery, success (pain-free vision) occurs in only 50 percent of cases 6 months after surgery as opposed to 95 percent of cases for whom there was no uveitis pre-operatively. Can My Dog's Vision Be Restored? Maybe. It depends on the health of the eye, excluding the cataract. If the only thing wrong with the eye is the cataract and the patient's diabetes mellitus is well-regulated, surgery can remove the cataract and place an artificial lens. If the eye is deeply inflamed or is otherwise damaged, the eye may be blind even without a cataract. A veterinary ophthalmologist can evaluate the eye to determine the feasibility of cataract surgery. It is important to note that there are numerous eye drops advertised that claim to dissolve cataracts. None of these products actually work and wasting time with them may actually allow uveitis to set in and make for a much worse prognosis for vision. Is it Cruel To Keep a Dog Blind? Not at all. Dogs do not depend on vision the way humans do. A blind dog can get along very well as long as the furniture isn’t moved and the dog is properly supervised. For tips on helping a blind dog adapt: Blind Dog Support There are many medical conditions that render a dog blind and as long as the condition is not painful, the dog can live a normal life as a successful and happy pet. Cataract Surgery: What Is The First Step? The first step is a consultation with your regular veterinarian. Your dog’s diabetes must be well-regulated before surgery is considered. If pre-operative lab tests show nothing to preclude anesthesia, your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist, as clinics do not usually have the specialized equipment necessary. A regular veterinarian is not qualified to perform cataract surgery. What Happens At The Ophthalmologist's? It is necessary to determine if the eye is going to be visual after cataract surgery. There is, after all, no point in performing this surgery if the eye is going to be blind anyway. The most important test is called an ERG (an electroretinogram). This test checks the retina for electrical activity, which indicates the eye should be able to see after the cataract is removed. In addition to the ERG, the ophthalmologist will check for uveitis. It should be treated before surgery to minimize the inevitable inflammation after surgery. What Kind of Surgical Procedures Are Done? There are two types of surgery: lens extraction and phacoemulsification. With lens extraction, the incision tends to be larger, the post-operative inflammation is greater, and the potential for leaving bits of the lens behind is also greater. With phacoemulsification, an ultrasonic instrument is used to liquefy the lens, and a sort of vacuum cleaner sucks the lens away. This procedure is more difficult if the patient is older, and the lens is thus harder in consistency. This method is preferred for diabetic patients. After either surgery, an artificial lens is usually placed for optimal post-operative vision. What Kind of After Care Is Needed? The patient will need to wear an Elizabethan collar after surgery to protect the eye. Cortisone eye drops are needed for probably several weeks. Oral anti-inflammatories will be needed for weeks to months after. Drops to keep the pupil dilated will also be used. What Kind of Complications Are Possible? Complications to consider are: Should Surgery Be Done On Both Eyes? It is important to remember the old saying that the one-eyed man is king among the blind. A dog need only have one cataract removed to have vision restored. Doing both eyes is an option to discuss with the ophthalmologist, as some dogs need all the vision they can get. Cataract surgery requires committed patient care both in the hospital and at home. Your veterinarian will be able to answer your questions or direct you to other appropriate resources.

Category: Cushing’s Disease in Dogs (Hyperadrenocorticism): What Is It?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dog Owner Survey Cushing’s disease, also called Cushing’s syndrome or hyperadrenocorticism, results from an overproduction of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is produced by the adrenal glands, located next to the kidneys, and adrenal glands are stimulated to produce cortisol by the pituitary gland located at the base of the brain. There are two types of Cushing’s disease. In adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease, an adrenal gland overproduces cortisol because of an adrenal tumor. In pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease, the adrenal glands overproduce cortisol because they are overstimulated by a pituitary tumor. Signs associated with Cushing's disease may include increased thirst and urination, a voracious appetite, an enlarged and sagging belly, hair loss, lethargy/weakness, panting, and sometimes, recurrent infections. Diagnosis Cushing's disease can be difficult to diagnose, especially in early cases. Tests that may be needed to diagnose Cushing’s disease include: Treatment Treatment consists of medication to control the cortisol overproduction by the adrenal gland or surgery to remove the abnormal adrenal gland. Choosing the best treatment for a pet with Cushing’s disease depends upon where the problem is in your pet's body (i.e. pituitary or adrenal gland).

Category: Cushing's Syndrome (Hyperadrenocorticism): Description
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources This condition represents a classical excess in cortisone-type hormone circulation in the body; it's a relatively common hormone imbalance. Both cats and dogs can be affected (though it is primarily a dog's disease) and the onset is insidious. Cushing's syndrome is the resulting set of symptoms observed when the body is exposed to excess cortisone (or related hormones) over a long period of time. Cortisol (called hydrocortisone when used as a medication) is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that are located atop the kidneys. Cortisol is stored in the adrenal glands and is released in times of stress where it helps our bodies prepare for a fight or flight situation. It adjusts the metabolism to expect physical exertion by mobilizing fat and sugar stores and retaining sodium and water. It puts us in a state of break down so that our stored resources can be used quickly. However, if the body is exposed to this hormone most of the time instead of during short stressful periods only, the state of break down becomes debilitating. There are several mechanisms that can lead to Cushing's syndrome and, as they are treated differently, it is important to determine which one is at work in a given animal. In the normal body, the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, can detect when cortisol levels in the blood are declining. In response, the pituitary secretes a stimulating substance, called ACTH, which causes the adrenal gland to release more cortisol. When the pituitary gland detects that cortisol levels are again appropriate, it stops its stimulatory message. You can think of the pituitary gland as a thermostat for cortisol, though the pituitary gland regulates many other hormones as well. This raising and lowering of cortisol blood level is regulated throughout the day via ACTH secretion and occurs rapidly. Pituitary-Dependent Cushing's Syndrome This form of Cushing's disease accounts for 85% of dogs with Cushing's syndrome. Basically, the pituitary gland grows a small tumor. The tumor is generally too small to cause any trouble due to its size and it is generally a benign tumor. This tumor, however, over-produces ACTH, thus leading to over-stimulation and enlargement of both adrenal glands and an over-production of cortisone. Occasionally (10% of pituitary-dependent Cushing's dogs), these benign pituitary tumors are large enough to compress the brain. In these cases, neurological signs may be observed; these cases are unusual but very hard to treat (see section onmacrotumors.) Adrenal-Dependent Cushing's Syndrome In 15% of dogs with Cushing's syndrome, an adrenal tumor is directly over-producing cortisone. The tumor is often large enough to see with radiographs or ultrasound and may be malignant. There is very little or no production of ACTH from the pituitary gland and as a result the opposite adrenal gland is usually atrophied/small. Overuse of Cortisone-Type Hormones Cortisone derivatives may be the most widely utilized drugs in veterinary medicine. A single corticosteroid medication can be used to treat a multitude of completely different diseases simply by using different dosing schedules. Steroids are commonly used to relieve inflammation particularly in skin allergies, arthritis pain, lung disease and more. Relief is usually rapid and many owners find themselves requesting cortisone shots or pills over and over again. In time, Cushing's syndrome can result, not from any inherent disease in the pet's system but from the effects of the hormones given over the long term. The pituitary gland perceives the high steroid levels yielded by the medication and does not send stimulation to the adrenal glands. In time, the adrenal glands atrophy and are not able to release cortisone on their own should they be required to do so. This effect lasts as long as a period of three months after the cortisone medication has been discontinued. To allow the adrenal to gradually recover, cortisone pills are usually prescribed in a decreasing dose, rather than a sudden stoppage; an owner should never discontinue the pills suddenly. Commonly prescribed cortisone derivatives include: Vetalog, Azium,prednisone/prednisolone,dexamethasone, Depo-Medrol, triamcinolone, methylprednisolone, Medrol™ and others. These medications have important parts to play in medicine but they must be respected and not used indiscriminately, nor discontinued suddenly after prolonged use.

Category: Diabetic Dog Diet
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources By now, you know thatdiabetes mellitusis about a lack of insulin and a need to balance insulin given by injection with dietary nutrients, especially sugars, fats, and proteins. Regardless of the patient's species, there are some basic principles that hold true for the dietary management of diabetes mellitus. First, the obvious: the pet must like the food and reliably eat it. For most diabetic dogs, the excessive appetite typical of the disease ensures this but after regulation is achieved and appetite is more normal, it is important that the dog eats on a dependable schedule. Insulin is typically given only after the pet has eaten, so the food should taste good, and the pet should want to eat it. Second, the food must be of quality and quantity to maintain a good body condition so that the dog is able to build muscle and a healthy amount of body fat. Some diabetic dogs are very thin, while others are too fat. It is important to tailor the diet to the individual rather than to adhere to rigid dietary rules. The ultimate goal is to feed the dog two similar meals a day, approximately 12 hours apart, with less than 10% of the total nutrients for the day coming from treats. Insulin is given within an hour of eating each meal and this schedule should be maintained with as much regularity as possible. No diet type has emerged as being optimal for diabetic dogs. The basic idea is to feed the dog a food that will maintain a healthy weight. Most dogs will not need a diet change, but this may be a good time to re-evaluate your feeding strategy. Here are some considerations: Treats Basically, minimize them. The regulation of diabetes mellitus depends on the balance between the carbohydrates going in and the insulin allowing them to be stored. Many people like to offer the dog a treat after insulin injections or after blood sampling. This can add a surprising amount of calories, and it is important to realize that every treat works against the insulin injections you are giving. If treats are felt to be necessary it will be important to determine how many calories are being added to the daily intake this way and adjust the meal amount accordingly. Ideally, treats are small and low in carbohydrates. High-fiber vegetable bits usually work. Baby carrots should fit the bill. Similar vegetables are also good choices.   Fiber These large bowel bacteria break down this type of fiber to feed not only themselves but also to feed the animal's colon cells, improve bowel circulation, and generally contribute to bowel health. The problem is that this process leads to a higher post-meal sugar surge in the bloodstream, which is exactly what we do not want. Insoluble fibers, such as cellulose, bulk up the stool, which can stimulate the colon. Insoluble fiber is not digested by the colon bacteria and does not offer calories to the pet that has consumed it. This is helpful for weight loss programs, as the indigestible fiber contributes to a feeling of fullness without contributing calories. After a meal, the starches and sugars taken in with the food lead to a postprandial surge in blood sugar levels. Since the diabetic dog is dealing with runaway blood glucose levels 24 hours a day, meals, as necessary as they are, raise blood sugar even further. Our goal with dietary therapy is to blunt this effect. Insoluble fiber in the diet helps accomplish this by slowing the digestion and transit of the food in the gut. Too much insoluble fiber, however, will give the pet a false sense of being full and reduce appetite, which may not be what we want if the pet is underweight. So what are we looking for in a food? If the dog is overweight, we probably want a higher fiber diet (say greater than 15 percent of the dry matter as fiber) but for a more average dog, we want a moderate amount of fiber (5-15 percent of the dry matter). The fiber content noted in the guaranteed analysis will likely not specify if the fiber is soluble or insoluble; you will need to check the ingredient list to be sure. HOW TO CALCULATE FIBER CONTENT IN FOOD ON A DRY MATTER BASIS  To calculate the percentage of fiber in a diet on a dry matter basis, look for the “crude fiber” and the “moisture content” amounts on the guaranteed analysis on the food label. SAMPLE GUARANTEED ANALYSIS Crude Protein (min).......8%Crude Fat (min).........6%Crude Fiber (max).........1.0%Moisture (max).........78%  The moisture content is the amount of water in the food on an "as fed" basis expressed as a percent (what percent of the food you are feeding is actually just water). Take the moisture content and subtract from 100 to get the dry matter content of the food (the part of the food that is actually food and not water). For example, if the moisture content is 78% (typical canned food) then the dry matter is 22%. Now take the crude fiber value from the guaranteed analysis on the label and divide by the percent of dry matter. For example, crude fiber on the label is 1%, and moisture content is 78%. This means dry matter is 22% and 1 divided by 22 = 0.045 or 4.5%. Our hypothetical canned food is 1% fiber as fed but 4.5% on a dry matter basis. When comparing foods, always compare on a dry matter basis so as to compare "apples to apples". The above diet is way too low in fiber for an overweight dog and probably a little light on fiber for a dog of normal weight or thin dog. High Digestibility Diets: Probably not the Best Thing There are numerous diets on the market designed for dogs with sensitive stomachs. These foods typically are designed for easy digestion and absorption. While this is helpful to the dog with digestive issues, easy digestion and absorption amounts to higher blood glucose levels after eating. This is probably not the best thing for a diabetic dog. Similarly, soft moist foods are preserved and flavored with sugars. These, as you might guess, raise postprandial blood sugar readily and are poor choices. These diets are not as common as they once were and should not be confused with canned foods. Low Fat A common issue that accompanies diabetes mellitus is elevated triglycerides (fats) in the bloodstream. In humans, this is the doorway to vascular disease, cholesterol deposits, heart disease, and stroke. Dogs do not generally have to contend with these issues but dietary fat becomes more relevant if the dog is one of the 30% for whom pancreatitis is believed to have damaged the pancreas and led to diabetes in the first place. If pancreatitis is in play or if the patients circulating triglyceride level is high, then fat restriction is going to be a must. Further, L-carnitine supplementation may also be of benefit as this nutrient is helpful in fat transport and metabolism. Fat-restricted diets may not be a good idea for very thin diabetic dogs, however. Other Concepts As long as the diet is consistent, it is generally possible to work with it to achieve diabetic regulation. Here are some additional tips: Your veterinarian can help you choose the most appropriate food for your diabetic dog. There are several commercial diets made just for this purpose or you may elect to find one on your own. You can also contact a commercial pet nutrition service for further help.

Category: Hard to Regulate Diabetic Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources The goal in long-term management of diabetes mellitus is the alleviation of unpleasant clinical signs (constant thirst, weight loss, etc.) and the prevention of dangerous secondary conditions (infections, ketoacidosis, etc.). To accomplish this, blood sugar levels should be regulated between 250 mg/dl (13.88 mmol/L) and 80 mg/dl (4.44 mmol/L). This is not as good as the body’s natural regulation, but it is a fair and achievable goal in most cases. Some patients just seem completely unaffected by even high doses of insulin, and it is important to have a step-by-step plan to rule out causes of insulin resistance so that regulation can be achieved. Insulin resistance is defined as: Persistent high blood sugar levels throughout the day when three units of insulin per four pounds of patient body weight are used. or A unit or more of insulin per pound of patient body weight (or more) is needed to achieve regulation. Typically, glucose curves show levels that are consistently too high with virtually no drop in sugar level when insulin activity is peaking. So what is going on here? The possibilities may seem surprising. Step One: Rule out Owner-Related Factors Owner error is actually the most common cause of what is thought to be insulin resistance. This may seem basic, but it is important not to skip the basics. Confirm that the amount of insulin being drawn into the insulin syringe is correct, that the injection technique is correct, and that the patient is actually receiving the injection. Rule out any snacking or changes in the patient’s feeding schedule. Be sure the bottle of insulin is not expired and that it has been properly stored. Ideally, the veterinary staff will observe insulin administration and will check the bottle while the pet is being checked in the hospital. Reviewinsulin storage and handling. Step Two: Determine for sure that the Patient is Insulin Resistant A glucose curve is needed to distinguish the following three phenomena. Somogyi OverswingIn the case of Somogyi overswing, the insulin dose is too high and drives the blood sugar low for part of the day. When the blood sugar is low, other hormones such as cortisone or adrenalin are released to raise blood sugar. These hormones can have a prolonged effect (many hours), thus creating hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). If the patient’s high blood sugar has been caused by a Somogyi overswing, a lower dose should be used and a new curve performed in a week or two. One might think a flat glucose curve (i.e. one not showing hypoglycemia followed by hyperglycemia) would rule out Somogyi overswing but, in fact, a Somogyi hyperglycemia can persist for days and create a flat curve. Often a good approach is to cut the insulin dose back and see what the curve looks like. Rapid Insulin MetabolismIn this case, the insulin simply is not lasting long enough to create sustained normal blood sugar levels. If the curve shows that the insulin effect is wearing off too soon, twice a day administration of the insulin may solve this problem or a longer-acting insulin may be needed. Longer acting insulins tend to have poorer absorption into the body from an injection site. This may also necessitate change to a different insulin type. Often it is necessary to change to a human insulin from a canine insulin. True Insulin ResistanceHere no significant drop in blood sugar level (levels stay greater than 300 mg/dl[16.65 mmol/L]) is seen in response to the insulin dose used. Usually there is a history of prior increases in insulin dose, all met with minimal response. Step Three: Spay Hormone fluctuations will easily account for insulin resistance as progesterone is one of many hormones that raise blood sugar levels (by stimulating growth hormone secretion). Canine unspayed female diabetics need to be spayed if regulation is to be achieved. (Feline patients do not have a similar relationship with naturally occurring progesterones and do not require spaying; however, progesterone-type medications can produce diabetes in cats. Diabetic patients of either species should not take progesterone-related medications.) Step Four: Rule out Infection Diabetic animals are at risk for developing bladder infections because they have so much sugar in their urine. Stress of any kind will contribute to high blood sugar and infection would lead to stress. A urine culture should be done to rule out bladder infection, plus the teeth and skin should be inspected for infection in these areas. If infection per se is not found, the patient should be screened for other chronic illnesses that might constitute a stress. A basic blood panel would be a logical starting point. If infection or other stress is allowed to go unchecked, ketoacidosis, an especially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus, can develop. To avoid infection issues, it is a good idea to plan for diabetic patients to have their teeth cleaned annually and to have the urine periodically cultured whether there are symptoms of a problem or not. Step Five: Control Obesity Insulin response is typically blunted in obese patients. If obesity is an issue, it should be addressed. A formal weight loss program using measured amounts of a prescription diet and regular weigh-ins is necessary for success. See general information aboutweight lossfor pets. If these steps do not reveal a relatively simple explanation for the poor insulin response, then it is time to seek more complicated causes. This generally means an additional hormone imbalance. Hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing’s Disease) This condition is relatively common in dogs but less so in cats. This condition involves an excess in cortisone-type hormones, either from over-production within the body or over-treatment with medication. Cortisone - more accurately referred to as cortisol - is secreted naturally in response to a fight or flight situation and prepares the body for exercise by mobilizing sugar stores. If sugar is mobilized into the blood stream in the absence of a fight or flight situation, diabetes mellitus can result. If the excess cortisone situation is resolved, it is possible that the diabetes will also resolve. About 10% of dogs with Cushing’s disease are also diabetic. About 80% of cats with Cushing’s disease are also diabetic. Testing for Cushing’s disease cannot proceed until some degree of diabetic control has been achieved and the patient is not ketoacidotic. Excess Circulating Lipids High levels of circulating triglycerides (fats) interfere with binding insulin to the cells it needs to act upon. While most dogs with excess circulating lipids are not diabetic, when a diabetic patient is insulin resistant it may be helpful to attempt to reduce the circulating fats. Excess lipids in the blood usually occur because of some other hormone imbalance (Cushing’s disease,hypothyroidismin dogs etc.) but they can simply happen spontaneously in the miniature schnauzer. Circulating fats are reduced by treating the hormone imbalance that caused them if there is one. If there is no underlying disease, circulating lipids can be reduced with diet and omega 3 fatty acid supplementation. Acromegaly Acromegaly results from an over-secretion of the pituitary hormone known as growth hormone. This hormone normally is responsible for one’s growth from infancy to adulthood. When adulthood is achieved, its secretion dramatically slows, bone growth plates close, and growth essentially stops. If for some reason, this hormone begins secreting again, growth resumes but not generally in normal proportions as the limb bones have closed their growth areas. One of the effects of growth hormone is causing the body tissues to become resistant to insulin by interfering with tissue insulin receptors. Animals with acromegaly are frequently diabetic. The prognosis and treatment for acromegaly is different between dogs and cats. Dogs generally develop acromegaly due to excess progesterone secretion, as would occur from an ovarian cyst. Canine patients are thus usually older, unspayed females and spaying may be curative depending on the remaining ability of the pancreas to secrete insulin. Antibodies against Insulin When a patient is treated with insulin from another species, the immune system recognizes the introduction of the foreign protein and generates antibodies. It was because of this phenomenon that most commercial insulin available is genetically engineered human insulin so that the world’s human diabetics no longer need to worry about making insulin antibodies. But where does this leave dogs and cats? It leaves them making antibodies against human insulin, that’s where. There is no feline insulin product available; the closest thing is beef insulin. Dogs are luckier as their insulin is identical to pig insulin and porcine insulin is available as Vetsulin® (Caninsulin® in Canada). If a human insulin is used, some degree of antibody production is a forgone conclusion. You would think this would pose a big problem but in fact insulin antibodies are not always bad. Most of the time the antibodies simply interfere with removal of the insulin, leading to a longer-acting insulin than would be achieved with the same type of insulin made from the native species. For example, Humulin N® (human insulin) will last longer in the dog than Canine Insulin N (if there were such a product). This may be desirable depending on the patient; changing the species of origin of the insulin is one way to get the insulin to last a bit longer. To become insulin resistant from antibodies, a body must lose 70% or more of the insulin injection to antibody binding. This is very unusual but possible and should not be forgotten as a possible cause of insulin resistance. Blood tests to measure insulin antibodies are available in some areas. Insulin can be switched to a species of origin more closely related to the species desired. If a Cause Cannot be Found If a cause cannot be found or if treatment for that cause is not practical or possible, the good news is that multiple high doses of insulin can generally overcome the resistance. Sometimes combinations of short and long-acting insulins are used together to achieve reasonable regulation.

Category: Hypothyroidism in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What Is Hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) results from decreased thyroid hormone production by the thyroid glands, which are located in the neck near the voice box. It is seen most commonly in middle-aged to older dogs. Affected dogs become easily fatigued, sleep for longer periods of time, are often dull in their attitude and may seek a warm area in cold weather. Slim breeds of dogs may seem puffy or over-weight, as the skin becomes thickened in hypothyroidism. The hair coat becomes dry and loses sheen, the color dulls and the hair may become very sparse, especially in areas of friction, with darkening of the skin. Clipped hair may not regrow. Affected dogs may become prone to skin infections and poor wound healing, as well as many internal health problems. Diagnosis Diagnosis of hypothyroidism depends on taking blood samples to measure hormone levels. Tests may include measuring total T4, free T4, TSH or a TSH stimulation test. In some cases, diagnosis can be difficult and repeated testing is necessary. Treatment Treatment is by administration of oral thyroid hormone supplementation. There is generally a rapid improvement in your pet's activity once treatment is started. However, determining the right dosage of the thyroid supplement can take time.  Additionally, regrowth of the hair and lightening of the skin may take several months. Occasionally, a pet may experience sensitivity to the amount of thyroid supplementation given. Signs associated with this include a rapid heart rate, increased water consumption or urination, change in temperament, or weight loss. Please contact your veterinarian if any of these signs occur. Hypothyroidism treatment is life-long because there is no true cure. Blood tests to measure hormone levels will need to be performed regularly to ensure that your dog is getting enough thyroid hormone supplement.

Category: Hypothyroidism is the Most Common Hormone Imbalance of Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hypothyroidism is a classic disease in dogs as well as people. We know that iodine deficiency leads to thyroid gland swelling (a goiter) and thus most of the salt we use is "iodized" to prevent this deficiency. Dogs do not get goiters when they become hypothyroid but they experience the metabolic "slow down" that comes with becoming hypothyroid. Because of the importance of thyroid hormone in metabolism, many organ systems can be affected and multiple symptoms are described. Diagnostic tests can be just as confusing as the symptoms but at least the treatment is relatively straightforward. We bring up these terms: T3, T4, TSH, and free T4 because these are the substances that will be tested when it comes time to run diagnostics. Every cell in the body is affected by it. Too much hormone and the heart races, blood pressure rises, and muscle and fat are burned until the patient becomes skinny and debilitated. Too little hormone and the patient becomes listless, overweight, and even bald in spots. Hypothyroidism is a medical condition where the body is deficient in thyroid hormone. It would seem simple enough to identify patients with hypothyroidism, test them, treat them and watch them return to normal. Unfortunately, it is not as easy to identify affected patients as it might sound. Let's review the issues relevant to this condition and the pitfalls that keep it from being a simple problem. What is the Thyroid Gland and What Does it do? The thyroid gland forms an H in a person's throat, though in dogs the thyroid exists as two separate halves. The thyroid gland produces T4, which is an inactive form of thyroid hormone. When T4 is absorbed into tissue cells, it is converted into the active form of thyroid hormone which is called T3. Most of the circulating T4 is carried by blood proteins and is not available for tissue absorption; the portion that is not carried by proteins (the so-called free T4) is the portion that is able to enter tissues for activation. The thyroid gland itself can also activate T4 into T3. In dogs about half of the T3 comes from the thyroid gland and the other half comes from the body’s other tissues. In humans, 80 percent of T3 comes from activation in the body’s other tissues. Production of T4 is regulated by the pituitary gland at the base of one’s brain. (This gland is called the master gland as it regulates hormone production in the adrenal system, the thyroid system, the reproductive system, and more). The pituitary produces a substance called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). When T4 levels are dropping, the pituitary gland stimulates the thyroid gland to make and release more T4. Active thyroid hormone serves as a sort of volume dial for metabolism. Since virtually every cell in the body can be affected by reduced levels of thyroid hormone, it is not surprising that reduced levels of thyroid hormone lead to symptoms in multiple body systems. Manifestations of Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism results when there isn't enough T3. This generally happens because there isn't enough T4. There isn't enough T4 because some kind of damage has occurred in the thyroid gland.  Thyroid gland damage can result from immune-mediated destruction of the thyroid gland, by natural atrophy of the gland, dietary iodine deficiency, or a congenital problem. In dogs, the first two causes listed account for almost all cases, though currently, the feeling is that atrophy of the gland actually represents the end result of earlier immune-mediated destruction of the gland. Hypothyroidism generally develops in middle-aged or elderly dogs, with the average age at diagnosis being 7 years. Breeds with a definite predisposition to develop hypothyroidism include the Doberman pinscher, the Golden retriever, the Irish Setter, the Great Dane, the Dachshund, and the Boxer. Hypothyroidism is a classical disease with a classical collection of clinical signs. One particularly well-done survey of 162 confirmed hypothyroid dogs showed the following common findings: One classical finding in hypothyroid dogs is a thickening of some tissues, especially of the face and head. The skin, in particular, thickens, leading to more skin folds and what is referred to as a tragic face. This thickening can occur in some other tissues as well (such as facial nerves – see below). Cardiovascular Signs Hypothyroidism interferes with the electrical fibers that more or less provide the wiring for the heart. The rhythmic contractions of the heart muscle are normally stimulated by these electrochemical fibers. Abnormal rhythms or slow heart rate occur in as many as 26% of hypothyroid dogs; still, the significance of this in terms of overall lifestyle is not clear. Many specialists feel thyroid supplementation should be started at a lower dose for patients with obvious heart disease. Neurologic Signs According to surveys of confirmed hypothyroid dogs, only about 2-4% have nerve problems, but a more complete study in 2017 puts this number much higher at 29%. There are several syndromes reported: Ocular (Eye) Signs Ocular changes are not common in hypothyroidism, but the high levels of blood cholesterol and circulating fat can sometimes lead to eye changes. When these changes are seen, often thyroid testing is recommended. Corneal dystrophy, an abnormal change in the clear covering of the eye, is such an eye sign. This finding is usually represented as a small white spot (sometimes a white circle) on the eye surface. To this degree, it is only a cosmetic problem and does not interfere with vision. In more severe forms, painful bubbles can erupt on the corneal surface which leads to ulceration. Obviously, this form would require treatment. Conditions not proven but previously suspected to be associated with hypothyroidism includemegaesophagus,laryngeal paralysis, infertility, and behavioral aggression.Despite the potential for hypothyroidism to lead to symptoms in multiple organ systems, evidence for these particular connections is considered tenuous. Testing for Hypothyroidism You would think testing for hypothyroidism would be simple: a blood test of the T3 or T4 level could be checked and if it is low, the patient is hypothyroid. Unfortunately, the situation is rarely so simple. Measurement of T3 If T3 is the active hormone, why can’t we just test blood levels of T3? Due to assorted compensatory mechanisms, T3 levels often fluctuate into the normal range in even truly hypothyroid dogs. This means that T3 values are virtually useless in diagnosing hypothyroidism. Measurement of T4 The T4 level (also called the total T4 level) is included in many routine screening blood panels. It would seem that a low T4 would indicate hypothyroidism and a normal T4 would indicate normal thyroid function. Unfortunately, it isn’t that simple. Dogs on certain drugs (most notably seizure medicationsphenobarbitalandpotassium bromide;prednisoneor other corticosteroids; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs; a heart medication called propranolol; a behavior medication calledclomipramine; or sulfa class antibiotics) or with illnesses other than thyroid disease often have depressed T4 secretion. These dogs will have low T4’s but are not hypothyroid. This means a normal T4 indicates normal thyroid function but a low T4 may or may not indicate hypothyroidism. There is also a grey zone where T4 results are considered not definitively normal and not definitively abnormal. In short, T4 alone is not adequate to make a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. It should be noted that the sighthounds normally have much lower T4 levels than other breeds. In Greyhounds, for example, the T4 levels typically run about 50% of what other breeds do. Interestingly, their T3 levels have the same normal range as other breeds. Free T4As mentioned, T4 is the precursor hormone that is not active but is converted by body tissues into T3, which is active. T4 exists in two forms: the form carried around bonded to a blood protein (this is called bound T4) and T4 floating around loose in the bloodstream (called free T4). Only free T4 can enter cells and be converted to T3 and the concentration of free T4 corresponds to thyroid hormone activity where it counts (i.e., at the tissue level). Free T4 levels are less subject to fluctuate into a falsely low range in response to non-thyroidal diseases or drugs than is a total T4 level. Free T4 levels are typically 1000 times smaller than total T4 levels, plus tests for free T4 have to work in such a way so as not to convert bound T4 into free T4 and thus interfere with results. Because of these two issues, it is somewhat difficult to test for free T4 and the only acceptable way to do this is by a method called equilibrium dialysis. At this time, most labs offer equilibrium dialysis-free T4, but it is important to realize that a free T4 level on a lab report is not an equilibrium dialysis-free T4 unless it specifically says so. Equilibrium dialysis-free T4 is sometimes notated fT4(ED). TSH Stimulation and Endogenous TSH levelsBefore there was readily available equilibrium dialysis-free T4, the test that was felt to be the gold standard of reliability was called the TSH stimulation test. In this test, a T4 was measured and then compared with a value drawn 8 hours after an injection of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The inability to respond to TSH was considered indicative of hypothyroidism. The problem was the expense, the need for 8 hours of hospitalization, and the fact that injectable TSH was frequently off the market. This test is rarely performed nowadays. TSH can be directly measured in a patient’s bloodstream. The idea is that the pituitary gland should be secreting high levels of TSH in a futile attempt to stimulate a diseased thyroid gland. Measurement of TSH levels is an important means of diagnosing hypothyroidism in humans and a canine version of the test was long sought. Unfortunately, when it finally became available, it was found that many dogs (approximately 25% and possibly as high as 40%) with true hypothyroidism did not have elevated TSH levels as one would expect; still, this test is often helpful in making the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Antithyroglobulin Antibodies (The TGAA test) Some thyroid testing panels include a measurement of antibodies against the thyroid gland proteins from which thyroid hormones are made. The presence of these antibodies confirms the immune-mediated form of hypothyroidism (though in later stages of this disease, antibodies are no longer produced). The only significance of this test other than academic interest is to identify patients that are positive for antibodies yet have normal thyroid hormone tests. These animals have a 20% chance of becoming hypothyroid later on, so regular periodic testing of thyroid hormone levels would be a good idea. Treatment of hypothyroid animals that are positive for antibodies is the same as treatment for those that are antibody-negative; the only practical use of the test is to identify animals at risk for becoming hypothyroid later on. Testing with a Trial of Medication Sometimes, the only way to test for hypothyroidism is to simply give the medication for several months and see what happens. Often, an improvement in attitude and energy level is seen within the first week. Hair re-growth takes substantially longer (typically 4 months minimum) as the follicles must reawaken and then grow a hair long enough to be seen. Is the Diagnosis Correct? Because of difficulties in diagnostic testing methods, many dogs have been erroneously diagnosed with hypothyroidism and have been on medication for years. If there is any question about a patient and you wish to re-test, thyroid hormone supplementation must be discontinued for at least 2 months for blood testing to be valid. If possible, medications known to interfere with testing should be discontinued for testing (though this is obviously not always possible). Treatment of Hypothyroidism At least the treatment of hypothyroidism is relatively straightforward; hypothyroidism is treated with oral administration of thyroid hormone (T4). Even hypothyroid dogs are perfectly capable of converting T4 to T3. Pills are given usually twice daily to start but may be dropped to once a day after good thyroid control has been achieved. There are many brands of thyroid supplementation available and prices are somewhat variable depending on the manufacturer. Treatment is given for the rest of the dog's life. Occasionally veterinarians are asked if it is reasonable to use dried or powdered thyroid glands of hogs or cattle as a more natural form of treatment. The answer is simply no. These products are not produced with adequate quality control to ensure that they contain a reliable amount of thyroid hormone. Each dose may be completely different when such a product is used. Re-testing Whenever an animal goes on a medication long term, periodic blood testing is a good idea. In the case of hypothyroidism treatment, it is important to know if the medication dose is too low or too high. Thyroxine (T4) is a safe medication but if it is not given in adequate doses, obviously the patient will not be adequately treated. If the dose is too high and given for too long a time, excessive water consumption, weight loss, and restlessness can result. Monitoring with T4 The lowest thyroid level of the day is found by taking the blood sample right before a tablet would normally be given. The highest level of the day is found by taking the blood sample 4 to 6 hours after it is given. Expect one or both such tests to be periodically recommended. Our hospital recommends some type of blood test monitoring annually. Monitoring with TSH level The canine thyroid stimulating hormone level (abbreviated cTSH) does not seem to require any particular timing issues and can be run on a blood sample taken at any time of the day. The cTSH level will not indicate whether or not the thyroid dose is too high but is quite accurate at determining if the level is too low. (Inadequate treatment is associated with high TSH levels, indicating that the pituitary gland is vainly trying to stimulate the thyroid gland with high levels of stimulating hormone). This test may be run instead of or in addition to a T4 level when it comes time to monitor thyroid hormone treatment.

Category: Insulin Administration in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Insulin is the injectable medication you use to control your diabetic dog’s blood sugar. When insulin therapy is first started, the optimal dose for your pet will be unknown and will have to be determined by trial and error. Most dogs will need insulin injections twice a day, though occasionally, a patient is found where a single dose is long-acting and once-a-day insulin works out. A dose will be selected based on what research has shown to be a good starting point, and after a week or two, a glucose "curve" will be needed to map out the blood sugar levels over the day. This has traditionally been done in the hospital with blood glucose samplings done every 2 hours during the hospital's hours of operation. Alternatively, a continuous monitor such as a FreeStyle Libre® (made for human use) can be implanted on the pet's skin. Several curves can be obtained at home via a special reader or cell phone. The curve or curves will show if the insulin is lasting long enough and if the dose should be raised, lowered, or kept the same. Alternatively, you can learn how to monitor your dog’s blood glucose levels yourself, but if you are a beginner, you may want to master giving the injections before moving on to taking blood samples.  If you become proficient at glucose sampling, you can perform the curve at home and message the results to your veterinarian, skipping the stress and expense of a hospital visit. This may not seem like a valuable technique to learn now that continuous monitors can be implanted, but going forward, you may want to be able to periodically (or even regularly) do glucose spot checks at home, and for that, you would need your own glucose meter and glucose strips. There are several insulins used in the management of diabetic dogs. Vetsulin®, Humulin N®, and Novalin N® are intermediate-acting insulins. Vetsulin® isof pork origin, but pork and dog insulin are identical, so Vetsulin®,(also called "Caninsulin" in other countries) is a veterinary product. Humulin N and Novalin N are human insulins available from human pharmacies. ProZinc® insulin is another veterinary insulin, while Glargine insulin and its variations are human products, all designed to last a bit longer than Vetsulin®, Humulin N and Novalin N. Vetsulin®, Humulin N, Novalin N, and Glargine are available in both vials (where one draws insulin out with a syringe) and pens (where a dose is dialed in and a button is pressed to deliver the injection). ProZinc is available only in a vial. Human insulins are much more concentrated than veterinary insulins and require special syringes. Many people prefer the ease of the pen, but it can be tricky if half-unit doses are needed depending on which insulin pen we are talking about. Be sure you understand how much insulin you are supposed to give your pet. Do not change your pet's insulin dose without veterinary guidance. Storing Insulin Insulin does not require refrigeration, but since many insulins do not contain preservatives, it is best to refrigerate the product since we want it to last a couple of months without bacterial contamination. Human diabetics frequently do not refrigerate their insulin at all, but as human doses are substantially larger than animal doses, the vial or pen will not need to last nearly as long. The bottom line is that it is best to refrigerate the pen or vial to maximize the shelf life of the product. Unopened vials or pens should be stored in the refrigerator. Syringes for Use with Vials Human and veterinary insulins are made at different concentrations, and thus, each requires its own type of syringe for proper dosing. Insulin syringes are extremely small in diameter so that injection will not be painful. It is a rare patient that objects to insulin shots per se, but some dogs resent being held still. It is crucial that the injection goes into the dog rather than into the fur of the dog. The best area for injection is around the shoulders but, if possible, the area of the injection should be changed up with each injection from right to left for best insulin absorption. Always be sure you have the correct syringes for your insulin. Used syringes should be placed inside a thick plastic container, such as a liquid laundry detergent bottle or similar receptacle. If the needle is enclosed in such a container, the entire container can be closed up and disposed of in the regular trash at home. Specific containers can be purchased for needle disposal, or the used syringes can be returned to your veterinary hospital for disposal if you prefer. Some states, such as California, have specific regulations for disposing of used insulin syringes (commonly called sharps). How to Give the Injections First, feed your dog.A dog's blood sugar that has not eaten a normal meal but receives insulin may drop to a dangerously low level. If your dog is not eating, this could indicate a need for a checkup with your veterinarian. After the doghas eaten, you are ready to give the injection. (Note, there is an exception to this rule. Novalin N appears to last longer if given before feeding. No one knows why this is and, as mentioned, this practice runs the risk of giving insulin to a pet that may not offset the insulin dose with calories.) Before drawing up the insulin, it is important to be sure that the insulin is properly mixed as some of it will settle on the bottom of the vial. The manufacturer of Vetsulin®recommends simply shaking the bottle until the contents are uniformly milky. The manufacturers of other insulins recommend gently rolling the bottle in the palms of your hands or rocking it back and forth lightly to mix. The only product that should be shaken to mix is Vetsulin®. When drawing up the insulin, always hold the bottle vertically and upside down to avoid unnecessary bubbles in the syringe. (See photo.)Since insulin is being given under the skin, bubbles are not an enormous problem as it would be with an intravenous injection but we still want to minimize bubbles. If you get bubbles in the syringe, flick the syringe with your fingers until the bubbles rise to the top, and then simply push the air out of the syringe with the plunger. After you have the insulin dose ready in the syringe, it is time to get your dog. Be sure you can trust your dog to hold reasonably still for the shot. Most dogs do not require a second person to hold them still but some dogs are rambunctious and a helper is necessary. If you have such a pet but no helper, consider tying a short leash around a piece of furniture. (Use a slip knot in case of a choking emergency.) Some dogs are uncooperative and require a muzzle. Lift up a fold of skin, ideally along the side of the body. This will create a small space for the needle. Insert the needle into this space and inject the insulin. Withdraw the syringe and needle when you are finished. Insulin by Pen An insulin pen is a gadget that allows precision insulin measurements and push-button ease of administration. The gadget is called a pen because it is shaped like a writing pen. A cartridge of insulin is snapped inside, and a small needle tip is applied to the pen tip (a new tip should be used each time). The dose is dialed in with accuracy up to the half unit, which is much more accurate than trying to eyeball tiny doses with a syringe.  The pen is primed with a dose before it is used on the patient. You insert the needle through the pet's skin and press a button at the top. The needle must stay in place for at least five seconds to ensure the full dose has been delivered. Most people find this method of insulin delivery easier than using syringes. Most human insulins are available as pens, but Vetsulin® is the only veterinary insulin available in a pen.  Vetsulin®pens are sold separately from their insulin cartridges. The cartridges should be stored upright, though the loaded pen may be stored on its side. Most human insulin pens are disposable and cannot be reloaded. Pens cannot be refrigerated without disrupting their measuring mechanism. This means that the insulin cartridge within the pen is good for about six weeks before it must be discarded and replaced. The needle's tips should be disposed of with the same precautions as for syringe disposal. Giving injections and becoming comfortable with needles may seem intimidating at first but you will most likely be surprised at how easy it quickly becomes. Managing a diabetic pet is definitely a project but can be a very rewarding one.

Category: Laboratory Tests Confirming Cushing's Syndrome
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Once there is some reason to suspect Cushing's disease based on the history, physical examination, and initial laboratory testing, it is necessary to do specific testing to confirm it. There are several options. We will begin with dogs and then discuss cats. Canine Cushing's Disease Testing The Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression TestUsually takes 8 hours in the hospitalDexamethasoneis a cortisone-type hormone that is used therapeutically for numerous conditions. When given dexamethasone, the dog's pituitary gland will perceive that there is a steroid and shut off its stimulatory message to the adrenal glands. In the normal animal, this means that a drop in blood cortisol level will be seen 8 hours after a tiny dose of dexamethasone is given intravenously. If either the pituitary tumor or the adrenal tumor form of Cushing's disease is present, the pituitary is not responsive to the presence of dexamethasone and continues to produce its stimulatory message regardless.  As a result, no drop in cortisol level is seen at the end of eight hours. This test is currently considered the most accurateto confirm Cushing's disease.Approximately 90 percent of dogs with Cushing's diseasewill test positive with it. To Run this TestIdeally the low dose dexamethasone suppression test is run in the morning. A baseline cortisol level is measured, a low dose of dexamethasone is given intravenously, and blood samples are checked again in 8 hours. Sometimes a 4-hour sample is also drawn as the pattern of suppression over the entire 8 hours may helpclassify the type of Cushing's disease. The pet will require at least 8 hours in the hospital. The ACTH Stim TestRequires one to two hours in the hospitalCentral to the concept of Cushing’s disease is the over-production of cortisol. It follows then that the adrenal glands of the Cushing’s patient would possess large amounts of stored cortisol hormone. So how do we detect these unusually large amounts of stored hormone vs. normal? Here's how: we give a dose of ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone), which is the hormone the pituitary gland uses to stimulate release of cortisol. Basically, we give a dose of ACTH and see if we get a normal cortisol release or an extra-large one. A baseline cortisol level is drawn, the ACTH is given as a shot, and then in 1-2 hours a second cortisol level is measured to compare. In this way, the adrenal gland's potential to release cortisol is measured. To Run this TestIdeally, the patient is fasted overnight and the test is performed in the morning between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. A blood sample is drawn, a dose of ACTH is given, and two hours later a second blood sample is drawn. When Would we Run this Test?Given that the Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression test is more accurate, when might we run this test instead? It turns out that this is the only test that can be used if Cushing's disease from overuse of steroid medications is suspected; the low dose dexamethasone suppression test does not work if medications have suppressed the patient's natural system. The ACTH Stim test is also crucial in monitoring Cushing's patients during their treatment. This test is more specific than the low dose dexamethasone suppression test meaning that the strongly positive dogs definitely have Cushing's disease (false positives are unusual) but since it is not a very sensitive test, the University of California Veterinary School no longer recommends this test to determine whether or not a dog has Cushing's disease. This is, as mentioned, the test that is used to monitor the treatment of Cushing's disease, however, and a dog being treated for Cushing's disease will likely look forward to many ACTH Stimulation tests ahead. The Urine Cortisol/Creatinine RatioThis is a screening test for Cushing's disease; a positive test here does NOT confirm Cushing's syndrome but a negative test DOES rule it out. In this test, a single urine sample is collected to determine the relative amounts of cortisol and creatinine (creatinine is a protein metabolite that is constantly excreted in urine). If there is a high ratio - a relatively high amount of cortisol being excreted - further testing is in order. Ideally for this test the urine sample is collected at home so that cortisol secreted in response to the stress of visiting the vet's office does not interfere with results. Feline Cushing's Disease Testing The Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression TestThe testing situation is somewhat similar in cats, though the ACTH Stim test is generally not considered useful. This test is performed similar to the way it is performed with dogs; however, the dose of dexamethasone required to test a cat is substantially higher as cats are more resistant to the effects of steroids. The test still requires eight hours in the hospital and the cat should be relaxed and kept quiet during the stay. If the cat is the type to experience a great deal of stress in visiting the vet's office, consider the urine cortisol:creatinine ratio. The Urine Cortisol/Creatinine Ratio This test provides an excellent screening test for Cushing's disease in cats and can be performed to include a high dose dexamethasone supression test to further categorize the Cushing's disease so as to best determine treatment. The owner should bring urine samples collected first thing in the morning on three consecutive mornings. Having the sample collected at home removes the possibility of interference from vet visit-induced stress. The first two samples are used to determine if the cat has Cushing's disease and the ratios are averaged. On the second day (after the second sample is brought in) dexamethasone pills are given to the cat at home and the sample from the third day is used to determine the type of Cushing's disease the cat has. Collecting a cat's urine at home is easier than it sounds. The cat is confined overnight and in the morning is allowed access to the litter box. The easiest way to collect the urine is to place a sheet of cellophane over the box. The cat will runkle this up a bit scratching around but only a small amount need be caught on the surface of the cellophane. A syringe can be used to suck up the sample and store it for transport to the veterinary clinic. No blood drawing is needed and the cat does not have to actually come to the vet's office for the test. The problem is that urine cortisol:creatinine ratios are possibly too sensitive and may generate false positives. For this reason, the low dose dexamethasone suppression test is listed by most experts as the screening test of choice for cats. It is important to note a diagnosis of Cushing's disease but it is equally important to consider that successful treatment of Cushing's is about controlling symptoms. If the symptoms do not warrant control, then treatment should be postponed until they are more problematic. After it has been determined that a pet has it, it is important to determine the type of Cushing's disease (adrenal vs. pituitary tumor).The next sectionon classifying the type of Cushing's reviews how this is done. Treatment options and prognosis are highly dependent on the type of Cushing's disease the pet has.

Category: Laboratory Tests Hinting at Cushing's Syndrome
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources When an animal sees the veterinarian for a potential clinical problem, an initial database is collected in the form of a blood panel and urinalysis, and possibly a urine culture. There are some tip offs to Cushing's syndrome that may be noted and added to the list of observed symptoms as evidence. The Stress Leukogram This term refers to the relative proportions of different types of white blood cells. There is a typical pattern produced by cortisol as the body responds to stress. This pattern is called a stress leukogram. If this pattern is seen in a patient that does not seem stressed, there is a possibility that an excess of cortisol is present. The stress leukogram classically involves: These are all types of white blood cells counted in a test called acomplete blood count(or CBC for short). You don't need to know what those cells do; it is the pattern of increases and decreases that suggests cortisol is afoot. Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Alkaline phosphatase (often abbreviated ALP or SAP) is one of the so-called liver enzymes, meaning that it is chiefly found in the liver. There is a form of this enzyme that is produced in high levels in response to cortisol. This enzyme is not harmful in excess levels but since such marked increases in its levels are associated with cortisol, this would be a good hint that either this patient is taking cortisone-type medications or has Cushing's disease. Elevated Cholesterol This is a common finding in most endocrine diseases and, in this case, results from abnormal fat mobilization. High levels of circulating cholesterol may, as in humans, alter normal circulation and blood clotting. These classic laboratory findings complement the physical examination and may lead your veterinarian to recommend definitive testing for Cushing's syndrome. Not all of these findings need be present to suggest further testing for Cushing's Syndrome but the suggestion is stronger as more of these hints are detected. Unconcentrated Urine and/or Bladder Infection When a pet drinks excessive amounts of water, the extra water is passed as urine. As long as there is extra water, urine will be dilute. Because of the immunosuppression associated with Cushing's disease, there may be evidence of bacterial infection as well, or such evidence may be concealed by the dilution of the urine. Ideally urine should be cultured if it is too dilute to reliably detect white blood cells or blood. Recent studies have shown that 20 percent of dogs with Cushing's disease have an inapparent bladder infection. Feline Cushing's Disease is a Little Bit Different The classical screening test findings seen in dogs are not typically seen in cats. Most cats with Cushing's disease do not have a stress leukogram as described above. They do not have elevations in cholesterol or liver enzymes and their thyroid levels tend to run in the normal range. Most cats with Cushing's disease arediabeticand have findings referable to that. Classically the cat with Cushing's disease has especially intractable diabetes mellitus and diabetic control seems to require high insulin doses if it can be controlled at all. It is generally the diabetes mellitus that is diagnosed first in a cat with Cushing's disease. If the diabetes does not respond to insulin as expected, underlying causes are sought and one of these is Cushing's disease.

Category: Cataracts in Diabetic Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources Most diabetic dogs will develop cataracts and go blind. This FAQ is designed to assist the owners of diabetic dogs in knowing what to expect and to make decisions regarding cataract surgery. What Is a Cataract? A cataract is an opacity in the lens of the eye. The entire lens may be involved or just a part of it. The patient will not be able to see through the opacity. Why Do Diabetic Dogs Get Cataracts? The lens of the eye is round, hard, and normally as clear as glass. Looking at the lens, it is hard to believe it is a piece of living tissue. The lens is suspended by fibers that can adjust its position so that one can focus vision. The lens is encased in a capsule and depends on the fluids of the eye for nutrients. The lens does not receive a direct blood supply. Normally, the lens absorbs glucose from the eye fluids, using most of this for its own energy needs. Some of the excess is converted to another sugar called sorbitol. When there is excess sugar in the eye fluids, as in diabetes mellitus, there is excess sorbitol produced. Sorbitol pulls water into the lens, which in turn disrupts lens clarity and causes the cataract. Fructose is also produced from the excess glucose and also contributes to this water absorption. Cataracts do not necessarily imply poor diabetic control. Even well-controlled dogs can still get cataracts. How Long Does It Take To Go Blind? Generally, the cataract has matured, and the dog is blind in a matter of weeks. Until recently, blindness in a diabetic dog was basically a foregone conclusion, but there is a new product calledKinostat®that has changed that outlook. To review, the lens absorbs glucose from the fluids of the eye and uses this glucose as nutrition. Any extra glucose that is absorbed into the lens is converted to sorbitol by an enzyme called aldose reductase. Sorbitol pulls water into the lens to prevent the lens from becoming dehydrated. This is all well and good, but in the diabetic state, there is lots of excess glucose, and the excess glucose gets converted to excess sorbitol, which, in turn, pulls so much water into the lens that clarity and function are disrupted, and a cataract is formed. Kinostat is an aldose reductase inhibitor that curtails sorbitol production. Early use of Kinostat may significantly delay or even completely prevent the development of cataracts. Kinostat is preventive only and will not reverse cataract formation that has already occurred. Kinostat is unfortunately not yet commercially available, though has been reportedly near coming to market for some time. What Does It Mean To Say That a Cataract Is Mature? A cataract’s maturity is determined by how much visual impairment the pet is believed to have. Since we cannot ask a dog to read an eye chart, we must determine this by visually inspecting the eye. A light is used to look into the eye and view the colorful area at the back of the eye called the tapetum. (This is the area that flashes or appears colored in certain lighting.) When less than 10 percent of the tapetum is obstructed, the cataract is very young and does not significantly change vision. When 10-50 percent of the tapetum is obstructed, this cataract is called early immature. When 51-99 percent is obstructed the cataract is late immature. The mature cataract obstructs the entire tapetum. Ideally, a cataract is removed in the early immature stage for the lowest surgical complication rate. When a cataract is hypermature, it starts to liquefy and dissolve. This can actually lead to restoring vision, which sounds like a positive turn of events; unfortunately, the dissolution process is quite inflammatory. The resulting inflammation can be painful and can damage the eye even more. All cataracts do not progress all the way to hypermature and may stay static or progress at changing rates; however, diabetic cataracts are notorious for reaching hypermaturity and creating inflammation. What Is Uveitis? Uveitis is inflammation of the eye's uveal tract, which consists of the eye's vascular tissues. In this situation, uveitis is the inflammation that results when the hypermature cataract begins to liquefy. Uveitis is painful and tends to cause the eye to become reddened and the pupil to constrict. When a pet has uveitis before surgery, success (pain-free vision) occurs in only 50 percent of cases 6 months after surgery as opposed to 95 percent of cases for whom there was no uveitis pre-operatively. Can My Dog's Vision Be Restored? Maybe. It depends on the health of the eye, excluding the cataract. If the only thing wrong with the eye is the cataract and the patient's diabetes mellitus is well-regulated, surgery can remove the cataract and place an artificial lens. If the eye is deeply inflamed or is otherwise damaged, the eye may be blind even without a cataract. A veterinary ophthalmologist can evaluate the eye to determine the feasibility of cataract surgery. It is important to note that there are numerous eye drops advertised that claim to dissolve cataracts. None of these products actually work and wasting time with them may actually allow uveitis to set in and make for a much worse prognosis for vision. Is it Cruel To Keep a Dog Blind? Not at all. Dogs do not depend on vision the way humans do. A blind dog can get along very well as long as the furniture isn’t moved and the dog is properly supervised. For tips on helping a blind dog adapt: Blind Dog Support There are many medical conditions that render a dog blind and as long as the condition is not painful, the dog can live a normal life as a successful and happy pet. Cataract Surgery: What Is The First Step? The first step is a consultation with your regular veterinarian. Your dog’s diabetes must be well-regulated before surgery is considered. If pre-operative lab tests show nothing to preclude anesthesia, your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist, as clinics do not usually have the specialized equipment necessary. A regular veterinarian is not qualified to perform cataract surgery. What Happens At The Ophthalmologist's? It is necessary to determine if the eye is going to be visual after cataract surgery. There is, after all, no point in performing this surgery if the eye is going to be blind anyway. The most important test is called an ERG (an electroretinogram). This test checks the retina for electrical activity, which indicates the eye should be able to see after the cataract is removed. In addition to the ERG, the ophthalmologist will check for uveitis. It should be treated before surgery to minimize the inevitable inflammation after surgery. What Kind of Surgical Procedures Are Done? There are two types of surgery: lens extraction and phacoemulsification. With lens extraction, the incision tends to be larger, the post-operative inflammation is greater, and the potential for leaving bits of the lens behind is also greater. With phacoemulsification, an ultrasonic instrument is used to liquefy the lens, and a sort of vacuum cleaner sucks the lens away. This procedure is more difficult if the patient is older, and the lens is thus harder in consistency. This method is preferred for diabetic patients. After either surgery, an artificial lens is usually placed for optimal post-operative vision. What Kind of After Care Is Needed? The patient will need to wear an Elizabethan collar after surgery to protect the eye. Cortisone eye drops are needed for probably several weeks. Oral anti-inflammatories will be needed for weeks to months after. Drops to keep the pupil dilated will also be used. What Kind of Complications Are Possible? Complications to consider are: Should Surgery Be Done On Both Eyes? It is important to remember the old saying that the one-eyed man is king among the blind. A dog need only have one cataract removed to have vision restored. Doing both eyes is an option to discuss with the ophthalmologist, as some dogs need all the vision they can get. Cataract surgery requires committed patient care both in the hospital and at home. Your veterinarian will be able to answer your questions or direct you to other appropriate resources.

Category: Collie Eye Anomaly in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Collie eye anomaly (CEA) is an inherited syndrome of eye problems that can cause vision defects. The disease occurs in both eyes, but each eye may be affected differently. The dogs who are destined to have the syndrome are born with the inherited DNA mutation, although the abnormalities may or may not be present at birth, so technically it is not a birth defect. Symptoms of CEA, such as retinal folds, can appear after birth at a certain age and then disappear as the dog ages. Some retinal detachments can be progressive and worsen over time, so it can be a progressive disease. About 50 years ago, veterinarians estimated that about 90 percent of collies carry the DNA mutation although not all those dogs have the syndrome itself. Lowering that percentage has been difficult because CEA affected such a large percentage of the breed. Thanks to eye examinations and selective breeding, the number of affected dogs has decreased significantly. The syndrome has no cure, although there are some treatments for some of the eye problems, such as surgery for progressive retinal detachments if they worsen over time. Generally speaking, most dogs with CEA have abnormal vision and their vision is affected by choroidal hypoplasia and colobomas (see below) in addition to the retinal detachments. Affected dog breeds generally include collies, Australian shepherds, border collies, Shetland sheepdogs, and the Lancashire heeler. Eye defects seen in the syndrome have been seen in atypical breeds and mixed breeds with collie-type heritage as well. The problem in CEA is that an area of the retina (the nerve layer of the eye with rods and cones) and/or the choroid (the choroid is the blood vessel layer under the retina) does not develop the way it should because of DNA mutations. The damage to an individual’s vision depends on the severity of the syndrome. Many dogs are carriers of the DNA mutation but do not have the disease, while other dogs are affected and can have various eye problems as a result. It is possible for a retina to detach early or later in life, causing blindness in that eye. Typically, CEA is diagnosed during a screening by a veterinary ophthalmologist who looks at the front of the eye and the fundus (back of the eye) when the dog’s pupils are dilated. Before Breeding The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. To have this type of disorder, the dog inherits two CEA mutated genes, one from each parent. The dogs who have only one mutated gene for CEA from one parent do not have the disease and are called carriers. If a carrier is mated to a carrier, then 25 percent of the puppies will have the disease with two copies of the mutation, 50 percent will be carriers with one copy of the mutation, and 25 percent will be clear with no mutations. If a carrier is mated to a clear, then 50 percent of the offspring will be clear, and 50 percent will be carriers. That’s why dogs with CEA or carriers of the CEA mutation should not be bred to each other Breeders of dog breeds affected by CEA should have their dogs screened for CEA before breeding individual dogs. The genetic test for CEA can determine all three genetic states of a normal carrier, and affected with 90-95% accuracy. Even puppies can have genetic tests as long as they are large enough for your veterinarian to safely take a teaspoon of blood to send in for testing. It is ideal to breed clinically normal dogs to each other, which can be difficult if there are not many clinically normal dogs in the geographic area. Unfortunately, dogs that appear normal may still be carriers for the CEA mutation, and breeding two carrier dogs to each other can still run the risk of producing 25% affected puppies and 50% carrier puppies. That means that even parent dogs with no signs of the CEA disease can produce severely affected puppies with blindness or ongoing eye problems. Nonetheless, selective breeding is helping to reduce the number of cases worldwide. Puppies can be checked by a veterinary ophthalmologist at 5-6 weeks old, preferably before 12 weeks, and their pupils must be dilated for this examination. Responsible breeders should conduct genetic testing on the parents and eye exams on the puppies before 12 weeks of age to determine which dogs should not be bred or should be bred with care to another tested dog. Specific Possibilities The choroid, a blood vessel layer underneath the retina, can suffer from an abnormality in development referred to aschoroidal hypoplasia. It is the most common problem found in CEA and occurs when the blood vessels do not develop under the retina so the retina cannot be viable or functional without a nutrient supply.  The areas of choroidal hypoplasia cause blind spots in vision.   Retinal folds can disappear with age so they may not be seen in the eye exam of a dog over 12 weeks of age and an eye exam just before 12 weeks of age is ideal.  The eye symptoms can be difficult to see without extensive training in veterinary ophthalmology and specialized eye exam equipment. Sometimes, a separation will occur between the retina and the choroid causing aretinal detachment.The detached part might be just a small area of the retina or all of it. Complete retinal detachment results in blindness in the affected eye. Retinal detachment can be seen at any age. If a retinal detachment occurs in and blinds only one eye, dogs usually retain some vision from their other eye.  Retinal detachment can cause vision loss but not pain or can cause recurrent bleeding in the eye.  The worst possible outcome is recurrent bleeding in the eye that leads to glaucoma, blindness, and pain that requires surgery to make the dog comfortable. A colobomais a focal cupping or bulging in the eyeball, often near the optic disc. Severe cases of these can be associated with blindness or retinal detachments. Retinal foldsoccur when the retina is too large for the eye and creates folds inside it. It is commonly associated with CEA. These folds sometimes resolve with age. Vascular diseasecan cause a defect in the eye vessels that are responsible for the blood supply. These may be malformed, undersized, or might not even be there. A diagnosis of CEA can be frightening but remember that vision is not always lost – at least not all of it – and procedures are available to lessen the impact of some of the painful issues. Preventing CEA is best done through screening eye exams and DNA testing in breeding dogs.  Once the eyes are not formed properly, no cure is possible.

Category: Distichiasis Requires Permanent Eyelash Removal in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Distichiasis is quite common in dogs. Distichiasis is a condition in which extra hairs grow out of the eyelash area. It happens when there are two or more hairs growing out of a Meibomian gland opening. (Meibomian glands are located along the margin of the eyelid.) These hairs are not supposed to be there. In some cases, these extra hairs can be long and stiff and irritate the eye, resulting in a corneal ulcer. The severity of the problem depends on how stiff the hairs are, how long they are, where they’re located, and how many extra hairs there are. Distichiasis is different fromentropion. Distichiasis involves extra eyelashes; entropion is an inward roll of the eyelid that causes eye irritation from normal eyelashes or hair. Untreated distichiasis can cause corneal ulcers, chronic eye and eyelid pain, and excessive tearing. It is quite uncomfortable and/or painful for the animal, depending on the amount irritation. If the excessive hair causes any clinical signs at all, the hair should be permanently removed. Signs include increased blinking, lots of extra tears that often look like a tear streak, and squinting. Dogs don’t typically paw at the eye. The more severe cases are the most easily diagnosed, as the milder cases often involve small softer hairs that can easily be missed. It’s seen most often in puppies or young adults and is typically diagnosed before a dog is three years old. Any dog can have it, but it’s considered to be one of the most commonly inherited diseases in dogs, and considered by some to be the most common congenital eye problem. Breeds that seem to be predisposed to distichiasis include: Treatment There are several treatment options and your veterinarian’s choice will generally depend on how many extra hairs are involved and what equipment the veterinary facility has. General anesthesia is usually needed. Occasionally a very cooperative dog might allow treatment with only a local anesthetic, but that would be extremely rare. These procedures destroy the hair follicles, preventing hair regrowth. However, no procedure can be guaranteed, so retreatment may be necessary in some cases. Several follow-up visits will be needed, to make sure that the hairs are not going to regrow. Plucked hairs will just grow back, so plucking is not a permanent solution. Lid splitting and thermocautery can destroy the normal lid margins, leading to severe permanent scarring and entropion, so they are not good treatment options. The eyelids will have some post-operative inflammation, which your veterinarian will also treat. Prognosis Once the hairs have been removed permanently, the prognosis is good. However, dogs with distichiasis should not be used for breeding, because of the hereditary aspects.

Category: Entropion in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Entropion is an uncomfortable or painful condition in which the eyelids roll inward, allowing the eyelashes (or other hair) to rub against the cornea and irritate it. The upper and/or lower eyelids can be involved, and the condition can occur in either one eye or both. Causes While any dog can have entropion, there is often a genetic factor. When caused by genetics, entropion can be seen well before a dog's first birthday. Predisposed breeds include the Boxer, Bull Mastiff, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Chow Chow, Cocker Spaniel, English bulldog, Golden Retriever, Great Dane, Irish Setter, Irish Setter, Labrador Retriever, Poodle, Pug, Chinese Shar Pei, Springer Spaniel, and St. Bernard. Selective breeding for specific traits (e.g., skull formation, skin folds on the face, and prominent eyes) are thought to be contributing factors to genetic causes, but are most likely not the only genetic base. Selective breeding may have simply exaggerated entropion in breeds that were already prone to it. Entropion can also occur as a secondary condition, i.e., as a result of scarring in the eyelid, infection, corneal spasms and pain, trauma, or nerve damage. Sometimes entropion occurs after the eyelids lose their normal neurologic function. Signs An animal with entropion will squint and have an excessive amount of tears coming from the affected eye. Some animals will be sensitive to light and will rub at their eyes, particularly when they're outside. Some animals will produce a mucous-like discharge from the eyes. Flat-faced dog/cat breeds with entropion that involves the medial (inner) corner of the eyes may not show any discomfort simply because of their facial structure. In some animals, entropion is never more than a minor annoyance, but in others, it can cause painful ulcers and erosions that cause scarring and affect vision. That level of entropion needs surgical correction. Diagnosis Your veterinarian can diagnosis entropion through an ocular exam. A local anesthetic is usually used to make the examination easier on the animal. Because it’s important to determine if there is a corneal ulcer secondary to the entropion, a fluorescein dye may also be used. The fluorescein will stick to damaged parts of the cornea, and show as a bright green area. Treatment Medical treatment with antibiotic ointments can decrease damage to the cornea, but it can not resolve the entropion itself. To fix the eyelid, surgery is needed. If the entropion is significant enough to warrant treatment, the excess skin of the outer lids can be removed in a simple surgery called blepharoplasty. (Essentially, this is plastic surgery, so you can tell everyone your pet is having "his lids done".). Excess skin that causes skin folds is also removed, and the eyelids are tightened. Typically the entropion does not return after surgery, unless the case is quite severe. (Recurrence is more common in Chinese Shar Peis, due to the breed’s excessive facial skin folds.) The sutures should be removed in about 10 to 14 days. Some dogs will need to wear an Elizabethan collar to prevent them from rubbing at their sutures. If the animal has corneal ulcers, those will need to be treated too. Untreated corneal ulcers may scar excessively, impairing vision. Treatment will reduce the incidence of scarring. Treatment usually involves the use of antibiotic ophthalmic ointment. (To administer ophthalmic ointment, place your thumb directly below the eyelid and very gently push, which will cause the lower eyelid to pull away from the eye. Put the ointment in the opened lower lid.) Young puppies generally have only a minor procedure called lid tacking rather than the full blepharoplasty. Permanent surgery like the blepharoplasty isn’t typically done in puppies that are less than 6 months old because it's not possible to predict what the animal's adult head conformation will be, and the full surgery may not be needed. In lid tacking, temporary sutures are used to roll out the eyelids and keep the puppies' eyes healthy until they mature and grow into their adult facial features. Entropion can be seen in Chinese Shar Peis as young as two or three weeks old, and these puppies do quite well with the temporary eyelid tacking. Prognosis Prognosis is excellent, if surgery is performed before the cornea is damaged. If the cornea is damaged, then the prognosis depends on the type and severity of damage. Note:Dogs with the inherited form of entropion should not be used for breeding. See the recommendations from the Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) for dogs with entropion. Dogs with surgically corrected entropion cannot be shown in conformation classes at dog shows.

Category: Pannus in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pannus, also known as chronic superficial keratitis, is an eye disease that can result in blindness if it is not treated. Pannus is a lifelong problem that can typically be managed but not cured. Pannus is more common and more severe at high altitudes and in areas with severe air pollution. It is widely believed to be an immune-mediated condition, possibly as a response to exposure to ultraviolet light or other irritants. Genetic factors may be involved in the German shepherd dog (GSD) and GSD-mix dogs. A variation of pannus can affect the third eyelid, and is called nictitans plasmacytic conjunctivitis or plasmoma. Corneal pannus and plasmoma can occur together or alone. Pannus occurs most frequently in GSD and GSD-mix dogs, but it occurs sporadically in the greyhound, Rottweiler, Belgian shepherd, Belgian Tervuren, and several other breeds. Dogs 4 to 7 years of age are at highest risk for developing pannus. In German shepherds, the younger the dog is at diagnosis, the more severe and unresponsive the condition tends to be. Pannus tends to be milder and more responsive to treatment if the age of onset is after 5 to 6 years and if the affected patient lives at a low altitude. Both eyes are affected although one may look worse than the other. The cornea is the clear outer covering of the eye that attaches to the white sclera of the eye. Usually a pinkish film starts at the outer aspect of the cornea and conjunctiva and spreads towards the center of the eye. As the film spreads across the cornea, it becomes opaque. As time goes by, the cornea becomes dark or pigmented.An eye examination can diagnose pannus. Treatment Depending on the severity of the disease at diagnosis, aggressive treatment may be started to halt the progress and once the disease is under control, then therapy can be tapered to less frequent applications. In the beginning, eye drops and/or ointments must be given several times a day. Generally, a corticosteroid product is started initially. In severe cases or cases of plasmoma, cyclosporine or tacrolimus may be added to the steroid. When the dog is blind or near blind from the disease, subconjunctival injection of corticosteroids can be done at the onset of therapy in order to speed up response to the medications. The goal is to halt the progression of the disease and achieve remission. Flare ups are common and can occur at various seasons/times of the year. Periodic eye exams (3 to 4 times per year) are done to watch for signs of flare ups, so the treatments can be modified before the pannus becomes severe. Not every veterinarian is comfortable treating pannus. Discuss with your veterinarian whether referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist would be best for you and your pet. Prognosis Most dogs with mild to moderate pannus or that live at low altitudes respond well to topical medications. All dogs with pannus must be monitored carefully for flare ups, however. Dogs that live or work (such as military dogs in Afghanistan) at high altitudes can be much harder to treat. Cases that are not responding as expected or are poorly responsive to therapy should be referred to a veterinary ophthalmologist for further evaluation and to determine if other options should be considered.

Category: Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Progressive retinal atrophy, or PRA, describes a group of inherited degenerative disorders of the retina that occur commonly in dogs and rarely in cats. The retina is like the film in a camera.  It contains photoreceptors that convert light into electrical nerve signals. These disorders cause the photoreceptors to die prematurely. The different forms share similar features but have different biochemical causes.  PRA has no treatment and no cure but it is not painful. Both eyes become blind, but the vision loss occurs slowly, giving dogs time to adjust to the changes. Typically the first thing anyone notices is the dog losing the ability to see at night; then over a few months to 1 to 2 years, the ability to see under bright light conditions during the day is also lost. Owners may notice the dog’s reluctance to go outside at night, enter a dark room, or go up or down (especially stairs). The dog may also have dilated pupils as the eye tries to let more light in, and an abnormal shine called tapetal reflection may be seen through the dilated pupils. Oftentimes the dog adapts so well and the vision changes are so slow that no one notices anything different until the dog is in a new place or when loss of vision is almost complete. The onset of PRA depends in part on whether the photoreceptors never form properly in the first place (photoreceptor dysplasias) or whether they form properly but then degenerate (photoreceptor degenerative disorders). In the most common type, the photoreceptors develop and function normally at first, but then begin to deteriorate at some point. In the earliest onset form, puppies can have decreased vision by 12 weeks of age and may be blind by 1 to 2 years old. Some degenerative forms begin in early adulthood, some when the dogs are mature, and some as late as 9 to 11 years of age. The type or form differs between breeds of dogs. PRA is most commonly diagnosed in purebred dogs, but it can be seen in mixed breed animals. Breeds disposed toward the more common degenerative form include the miniature poodle, American and English cocker spaniels, Tibetan terriers, Samoyed, Akita, longhaired and wirehaired dachshunds, Labrador retriever, Papillion, Tibetan spaniel and many more. Breeds disposed toward the less common photoreceptor dysplasia include the Norwegian elkhound, Irish setter, collie, Cardigan Welsh corgi, and miniature schnauzer. Some dogs with PRA may get secondary cataracts, which are an incidental finding, or they may also be prone to inherited cataracts that make the vision loss happen more quickly. Because of the PRA, no affected dog is a good candidate for surgical removal of the cataracts. Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually made with an eye examination.  Your veterinarian may choose to refer your dog to a veterinary ophthalmologist to confirm the diagnosis, if PRA is suspected. The eye exam involves evaluating the fundus (retina/back of the eye) with specialized lenses.  Electroretinography can be used to look at the electrical responses in the retina, and is a good way to confirm PRA if retinal findings are inconclusive. It is usually performed under sedation by a veterinary ophthalmologist.DNA testing for PRA is available for some breeds; the test can detect if a dog has PRA or is a carrier for it. Affected dogs should not be bred, as that is the only prevention available.  SeeOptigenfor further information on which breeds can be tested using the DNA test. Living with a Blind Dog Because vision is the third most important sense to the dog (smell is first, hearing is second), most dogs do very well when they are blind.  Because PRA develops slowly in most dogs, they have time to memorize their environment, hone the use of their other senses, and adjust to living without vision. They can be so good at doing this that it may be impossible to tell when they finally go completely blind. Living with a dog who has PRA is not difficult. Your reaction to the loss of vision is likely to be much stronger than the dog’s. These dogs don't need any medication, their eyes are not painful, and PRA does not affect the rest of the dog as can many other causes of blindness. Keep in mind that it is easiest for them if the furniture isn't moved and children are taught not to leave toys and clothes out in the dog’s usual pathways. Safety gates, like those used for babies, can help keep them safe from falling down open stairs and preventing other mishaps. Keep the food and water bowls in the same location. Most blind dogs do well outside in their own fenced yards. They can be taught certain commands like “wait,” “curb,” “down,” or “stop” when being walked outside. When you’re travelling, leashes and harnesses are valuable tools. Sometimes other dogs in the household will serve as seeing eye dogs for their blind companion. The blind dog will follow the sighted dog around and pick up on cues from the other dog. Be sure to communicate with the blind dog using his other senses, such as smell and sound. Talk to him, avoid startling him when he is asleep by calling him or tapping your foot near him, slap your leg as you walk if you want him to follow you, etc. As long as you have a good attitude towards your dog’s condition and encourage him to remain an active participant in the family and home, most affected dogs remain happy and otherwise healthy.

Category: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-Like Syndrome in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called Uveodermatologic Syndrome) True VKH syndrome is a human disease, well described for nearly a century. A similar disease in dogs has been described but since we do not know the relationship between the canine and human disease, we are hesitant to call the canine version VKH syndrome as well. Until we know what is really going on in dogs, we will leave it at VKH-LIKE syndrome or, more accurately, uveodermatologic syndrome. A syndrome is a collection of symptoms. In humans, VKH syndrome consists of the following: Affected people are typically of Mediterranean, Hispanic or Asian descent. There are numerous links for more information regardingthis condition in humans. The syndrome in dogs includes: Unlike the human disease, deafness or meningitis is not a feature. The most detrimental part of the syndrome is blindness. What Causes this Syndrome? Uveodermatologic syndrome is an immune-mediated disease where the body inappropriately attacks its own melanocytes (the pigment-producing cells). These cells seem most prevalent in the skin, retina, and uveal tract of the eye. It is speculated that the immune reaction is initially triggered by a virus though research is ongoing. How is the Diagnosis Made? The best way to confirm this diagnosis is by a skin biopsy (the lip is said to be the best location). Treatment, however, is focused on the eye disease as this has the most serious outcome ‒ blindness ‒ while skin disease is generally cosmetic. Uveitis is most literally inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye. The uveal tract consists of the iris (the colored portion), the ciliary body (the area inside from which the lens is suspended), and the choroid (the vascular coating of the inside). The treatment for uveitis due to a VKH-like syndrome is the same as for other causes of uveitis. Thanks to the Animal Ophthalmology Clinic, Ltd. for these pictures. See the completecase studyof Sheila. Treatment Uveitis, whether it is caused by VKH-like immune-mediated inflammation or something else, is treated by suppressing the inflammation. This means corticosteroids (such asprednisone) are taken orally as well as topically. VKH-like syndrome will require ongoing immune suppression to prevent blindness and sincelong-term steroid useis undesirable therapy often switches toazathioprine,cyclosporine, or some other stronger immunomodulating agent. Topical therapy is also necessary; steroid-containing eye drops or injections of steroids into the conjunctival membranes are commonly used.With aggressive treatment, some dogs are able to regain some vision but in general, vision cannot be preserved and a more realistic goal is to control the eye pain. Blind dogs still have a good quality of life as long as the pain is controlled. A 2018 study published in the JAVMA by Zarfoss et. al., reviewed 50 dogs with uveodermatologic syndrome. At the initial evaluation, 36% of dogs had glaucoma (increased eye pressure) and 57% were blind in both eyes. Some dogs were able to regain vision and 50% of subjects could see in at least one eye at the end of the study. Of the dogs that ultimately became blind in both eyes, blindness came on over 13.5 months (median). At least 10 eyes had to be removed in order to provide long-term comfort.

Category: Intervention for Choking in an Unconscious Dog
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Current treatment for choking (airway obstruction) in dogs includes performing the Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts), removal with forceps, performing a finger sweep (in an unconscious patient), or rescue breathing. Advanced airway techniques (surgical cricothyrotomy) may be an option in a veterinary clinic, or with adequate prehospital training in the field. The eXternal eXtraction Technique™ (XXT™) is a safer, more effective treatment/intervention for choking in an unconscious dog.The authors do not have experiential evidence using this technique in cats. Although true choking (complete airway obstruction) has been considered uncommon, the authors are aware of many reported cases of fatal airway obstructions during training or play sessions. There are also reports of pet owners suffering injuries including finger amputations attempting to retrieve an object from the back of a dog’s throat. Working dogs are particularly high risk due to their high drive and intense focus on rewards. Prevention Choking on a ball or similar object may be avoided by adequate safety precautions. The size and shape of toys and ball rewards should be evaluated before offering them to your pet. Balls and Kongs should be checked for damage, cracks, etc. Supervision is recommended for balls, Kongs, and chews.  XXT™ PullGrip Alternative It is valuable to know that there is also an alternate approach to the eXternal eXtraction technique. The PullGrip approach should not be used unless the dog can be placed in a stabilized position with its head in an “In-Line Position” with the airway parallel to the floor -- nose, ears, and spine all in a line. This alternate technique may be more effective for responders with reduced thumb strength. Indications  Step 1: Starting Body Position A. "Brace the Back" against the floor and straddle the dog in a supine position.  B. Position the head in "In-Line Position" with the airway parallel to the floor.  Step 2: Identify Landmarks A. Feel the ball.  Step 3: Starting Hand Position: Open Diamond A. Thumbs  B. Middle Fingers  C. Index Fingers  Step 4: PUSH HARD!! J-Stroke  Step 5: If breathing does not return spontaneously, provide 2 mouth-to-snout rescue breaths. Step 6: If the patient does not respond,begin CPR. Step 7: Seek veterinary care immediately.  Indications  Step 1: Starting Body Position A. If possible, have an assistant stabilize the dog on their back. The responder will position themselves in front of the dog facing their snout.  B. Position the head in "In-Line Position" with the airway parallel to the floor.  Step 2: Identify Landmarks A. Feel the ball.  Step 3: Starting Hand Position: Open Diamond A. Thumbs B. Fingers  Step 4: PULL HARD!! J-Stroke  Step 5: If breathing does not return spontaneously, provide 2 mouth-to-snout rescue breaths Step 6: If the patient does not respond,begin CPR.

Category: Wound Care for Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Injuries to our pets can come from unexpected sources just as often as those we worry about. When a wound occurs, healing has many paths that your veterinarian can take, but only one for you: get your pet to the doctor when you find the wound. Clients are often surprised by the level of care that goes intowounds,whether they are large or small. Some severe wounds are life threatening and some are not; some small wounds can trick you into thinking your pet will be fine without treatment when they won’t be. The sooner a wound is taken care of, the better. Deeply contaminated wounds or those greater than 8 hours old often need to stay open rather than be sewn shut, requiring the use of drains and a lot of extra care on your end. The most important thing for pet owners to understand is that wounds bigger than a small cut are almost always worse than they look. Oftentimes there is significant damage to the tissue below the wound, which you cannot see. Bite wounds — whether a coyote bites a dog, a dog bites a cat, a cat bites a rabbit, or rabbits bite each other — always have more damage than what you can see. Animal mouths are filled with bacteria, which can easily cause an infection in bitten tissue, and almost always cause contamination. Even if there isn’t much skin damage, there can be significant damage below the skin. Bites lead to a level of care that causes an unexpecting pet owner to be surprised at what is involved. Dog bites can crush and tear tissue as well as puncture a body. They can also cause lacerations. Cat bites tend to be puncture wounds, but cats can also cause lacerations. Puncture wounds are more likely to become infected than large lacerations. Typically, bites from dogs and cats are received on the neck, face, and legs. Neck wounds are particularly serious because trauma can occur to blood vessels, nerves, airways and the esophagus. The biggest problem with face bites tends to be damage to the eyes. Impalements from sticks, rakes, and other sharp objects are puncture wounds that can go rather deep into the body. Usually, pets must be sedated or anesthetized for wound treatment as they otherwise squirm too much and make good care nearly impossible. Wounds are painful and although pain medication is given, it’s often not enough to keep them still during treatment. The wound may or may not be sutured shut, which means being sewn back together. In certain cases, drains are used to steer any accumulating fluid or pus out of the body (see below). Preventing Infection The most critical goal is to prevent an infection from occurring within the wound. Preventing infection is behind much of what happens because deep infections take more time and discomfort to treat than preventing them. Dead or dying tissue has to be removed, a process medically referred to as debriding, before the wound can heal. In some cases, a small wound has to be enlarged so that the veterinarian can see what’s happening in the tissue below it. Then dead hair and other debris has to be cleaned out, and then the wound is disinfected. Types of Wounds Wounds are either punctures, abrasions, or lacerations. Puncture wounds occur after something pokes a hole in the body, such as teeth from another animal, nails (toenails or house nails), sticks, porcupine quills, and bones. A laceration is a tear that has jagged skin edges. If a dog bites down, it can break the skin and cause a puncture, but if he pulls or the victim pulls away, a laceration may be seen in addition to the puncture. Anything that can create a puncture can also cause a laceration if the skin gets pulled during the trauma. An abrasion is caused by a rough surface - such as the road, teeth, or gravel - rubbing against the skin. Generally speaking, an abrasion is not as bad as a laceration. Bites Bite wounds are usually either lacerations or puncture wounds, which force bacteria into the tissue. Antibiotics are sometimes given because bite wounds are contaminated and can become infected even when the pet is on antibiotics. Giving antibiotics before there is an infection helps keep it from growing out of control. Dogs tend to bite down, hold, and shake their victims, so they are most likely to cause a tear, but they can also cause punctures. Cat bites tend to be punctures only because their canines are a bit sharper than dogs' and cats weigh less, so that even if the victim moves, they are less likely to cause a tear. When Drains are Used In healthy tissue, the skin attaches to the tissue underneath it so that no space exists between the skin and the tissue. When space becomes available between the skin and the skin tissue (referred to as dead space), fluid accumulates there.  That fluid will delay healing and can allow infection to take hold, resulting in an abscess. If the veterinarian expects fluid to accumulate in the dead space, a drain is placed so fluid and pus won’t build up, and the wound will heal faster. Sedation is needed for drain placement and sutures, but often not needed for removal of the sutures. Typically, the drain does not exit from the wound but from a new incision. The drains must be kept clean to prevent more bacteria from entering. Some injuries serious enough for a drain may require the pet to be hospitalized for a bit.  Typically, drains remain in place for 3 to 5 days, but timeframe will vary depending on the type of wound. Your veterinarian will give you specific instructions on how to clean and care for the drains at home, and when to come back to have them removed. Because the idea is to keep the wounds from filling up with fluid, the drains are going to ooze: that’s their job. You can keep the skin around the drain clean and free of any sticky or crusty goo by gently wiping off any excess fluid with room-temperature water on a clean cloth. That wiping will keep the wound clean, help new tissue grow, and lessen the possibility of infection. Cleaning is usually uncomfortable if not painful, even if the drain itself is not bothering them, so it must be done gently. Don’t clean drains more than once or twice a day, depending on your veterinarian’s instructions. The oozed fluid can drain wherever the pet goes because it’s a constant process. It may be helpful to keep the pet in a crate or bathroom until the drains are removed so that the mess is contained. Sometimes a wound is in a place that doesn’t have enough skin for suturing, such as the face, or there’s been enough skin lost that suturing is no longer an option. Drains may be used in those cases. Treatment If you cannot get your pet into medical care within a few hours of being injured, the wound should not be closed without a veterinarian first removing the contaminated or dead tissue, a surgical process called debridement. If possible, the edges of a wound will be sewn (sutured) together because that is the fastest way to heal. However, if there is a lot of contamination or the wound has a deep infection, the wound will be left open for topical treatment and to ensure drainage. If the wound has abscessed (filled with pus), the pet will need to be sedated so the abscess can be lanced (poked open) and cleaned out thoroughly.Abscessesare a common result of cat bites to cats because we don’t see that there is a wound underneath their fur.With any wound, it’s important to prevent the skin from healing over too soon, especially with lanced and drained abscesses. The wound may open itself if it is closed too early. Pain medicine should be prescribed. The pain will lessen over the next few days. While this is harder than it sounds, don’t let your pet lick the healing wound or the drain. Your veterinarian should provide ane-collarso your pet can’t reach the wound. Typically, this will be a plastic cone; there are many types available at pet supply businesses that may be more comfortable for both you and your pet. After a couple of days, if the wound looks worse than it did when the pet received it, contact your veterinarian. Generally speaking, after the would heals, your pet will return to being the same physically as they were before – perhaps with a scar that doesn’t grow fur, perhaps not.

Category: Anaplasmosis
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease. Two forms of anaplasmosis are known: granulocytic anaplasmosis and infectious cyclic thrombocytopenia. Granulocytic anaplasmosis is more common. A dog can have both infections at the same time. Transmission is via a tick vector (a vector is an organism that can passively carry and transmit disease). A tick needs to be attached for a minimum of 24 hours to transmit the organism. Incubation time is about 1 to 2 weeks. Reservoir hosts (a source of infection and possible reinfection that sustains a parasite) are usually small rodents, deer, etc. Granulocytic Anaplasmosis Granulocytic anaplasmosis is an infection of white blood cells. It is caused byAnaplasma phagocytophilum. Anaplasma phagocytophilumis transmitted via a bite from anIxodes tick.Ixodes scapularis(often commonly called the deer tick, blacklegged tick, or bear tick) is the primary vector in the Midwest and Northeastern United States;Ixodes pacificus(commonly called the Western blacklegged tick) is the primary vector in the Western United States; andIxodes ricinus(commonly called the castor bean tick) is the primary vector in Europe. Granulocytic anaplasmosis is seen most commonly in dogs in the Northeastern, upper Midwest, and coastal Western United States. Since granulocytic anaplasmosis requires the Ixodes tick as its vector, seasonal outbreaks of the disease can occur from spring through summer. Clinical disease is most often seen in adult dogs, and golden retrievers and Labrador retrievers appear to get it more than other breeds. A. phagocytophilumcan infect a wide range of mammals. In addition to dogs, the clinical disease has been documented in cats, cattle, sheep, goats, llamas, and humans. Because of common vectors and rodent reservoirs, co-infection withBorrelia burgdorferican be seen and can lead to more severe illness. Clinical Signs and Prognosis Many dogs exposed to granulocytic anaplasmosis do not get obvious signs of the condition. If signs are seen, they most often occur during the acute phase of infection, which is 1 to 2 weeks after transmission. The signs may be vague and include lethargy, lack of appetite, and fever. Some dogs may become lame because their joints are painful. Less common signs include vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, and difficulty breathing. The prognosis for granulocytic anaplasmosis is quite good. Infectious Cyclic Thrombocytopenia Infectious cyclic thrombocytopenia is an infection of blood platelets. It is caused byAnaplasma platys. Anaplasma platystransmission has not been fully determined, although tick vectors are probable. The organism has been found inRhipicephalusandDermacentorticks. Clinical Signs and Prognosis Signs include lack of appetite, lethargy, fever, bruising on the gums and stomach, nosebleeds, and weight loss. Many dogs with infectious cyclic thrombocytopenia have only mild clinical disease, so the prognosis is generally good. Diagnosis Blood tests and urinalysis are the main diagnostic tools for anaplasmosis. The blood tests usually include a complete blood count, blood smear evaluation, biochemistry panel, serology to look for antibodies, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. If the dog is lame, radiographs and analysis of joint fluid are usually included. Remembering that Anaplasma antibodies can persist in an animal for years is important.So, unless the animal has clinical signs related to active disease, the testing and finding of antibodies does not automatically mean treatment is necessary. These antibodies can be present in a healthy/normal animal. Treatment Treatment includes antibiotics, pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Doxycyclineis the most commonly used antibiotic. Most dogs respond within one to two days after they first take doxycycline. Other antibiotic options are tetracycline or minocycline. Analgesia and anti-inflammatory drugs may be needed for joint pain. Let your veterinarian choose the anti-inflammatory, rather than choosing and dosing it yourself because dogs metabolize these medicines differently than humans do. Your veterinarian will have the most appropriate medication. Disease Prevention Because there is no vaccine for anaplasmosis, appropriate tick control is critical to preventing this disease. Preventing ticks from attaching and removing any ticks from your pet within a few hours of attachment is vital. Note: Dogs with anaplasmosis may also be infected with other tick-borne organisms (Ehrlichia,Borrelia, etc.), so infected dogs should be screened for those diseases also.

Category: Aspergillosis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Fungi of theAspergillusgenus are well known to most people as the lacy, fluffy mold that grows on foods kept a bit too long. There are over 180 species ofAspergillusfungi, and they generally do not cause disease unless the host has a compromised immune system or has a big exposure to the fungus. The most common species to cause problems in veterinary patients areAspergillus fumigatus(which typically infects the nose and nasal passages) andAspergillus terreus(which causes systemic/whole-body disease). Under the microscope,Aspergilluslooks like a beautiful flower, but note the spores (called conidia) it sheds. These float in the air to colonize organic matter or infect a host when they land. Sinonasal (Nose) Aspergillosis Sinonasal aspergillosis is the most common type ofAspergillusinfection. Sinonasal infections can be very invasive or less invasive, the very invasive kind unfortunately being much more common. Invasive infections actually destroy the delicate bones of the nasal sinuses while the less invasive infections involve formatting a big mucous wad of fungus called a "fungal ball" or "aspergilloma." Advanced imaging can detect either of these, but more on that later. What the owner usually sees is a snotty nasal discharge that often stinks, lasts for months, does not respond to antibiotics, and classically only comes from one nostril. Nose bleeds occur intermittently, and the edges of the nostrils are often ulcerated. Both the more invasive and less invasive forms create similar signs; it is imaging and/or rhinoscopy that usually tell them apart, and sometimes they occur together. Classically, the affected dog is of a breed with a long nose (collie, greyhound, dachshund, etc.), though in one study, retrievers and rottweilers showed the highest numbers, possibly suggesting they do more sniffing in fungal-contaminated areas. Any age dog could become infected, thoughAspergillusinfection is unusual in dogs under the age of one year. To diagnose sinonasal aspergillosis, two out of the following criteria must be met: Imaging (ideally CT or MRI) should be compatible with a fungal infection. This means bone destruction is visible. Radiographs can also be used, but CT and MRI offer superior imaging. Fungal colonies should be visible with rhinoscopy (a technique where a narrow needlelike camera is inserted in the nose). Aspergillusorganisms are seen in or cultured from either a tissue biopsy or the nasal discharge. A typical approach to a dog with a nasal discharge suggestive of fungal infection will likely involve imaging, followed by rhinoscopy. General anesthesia is needed for both of these procedures and referral is likely to be recommended as specialized equipment will likely be necessary. The treatment of aspergillosis has been challenging for many years; fungal infections, as a rule, are slow to clear, and for a long time, the only available drugs had toxic side effects. Today, sinonasal aspergillosis has a good prognosis thanks to a unique treatment plan. The patient is anesthetized, and the back of the throat is closed off with gauze and inflatable balloon catheters called Foley catheters. The nostrils are also closed off (the patient breathes through an endotracheal tube that is placed through the mouth) and a one percent solution of clotrimazole, a topical antifungal lotion, is infused into the nose and frontal sinuses. The solution incubates for an hour, and the patient is periodically turned to be sure all the nooks and crannies of the sinuses are treated. At the end of the incubation, the clotrimazole is drained through the nostrils and suctioned out. This treatment is highly effective, with an 86 percent success rate, though about one-third of patients require several treatments. Most of the time, the nasal discharge has resolved within a couple of weeks, but if there is still evidence of continuing infection one month after the treatment, the patient should be rechecked, and another bout of treatment will most likely be needed. If there is evidence that the infection has eroded through the sinus bones and has penetrated the brain, the treatment described above cannot be used, and oral medication is needed. Common medications used areitraconazoleandfluconazole. Several months of therapy are needed, and a 60 to 70 percent success rate has been reported. Disseminated Aspergillosis As shown in the photograph,Aspergillusfungi shed microscopic spores that float in the air and which we inhale all the time. Fortunately, we have an assortment of safety mechanisms built into our bodies that prevent infection (sinuses to trap inhaled debris, the ability to sneeze, the mucus lining of the entire respiratory tract to trap debris, cilia to remove mucus with trapped debris, and an immune system to fight infection). IfAspergillusspores called conidia escape these mechanisms and begin to grow, they become more difficult for the body to remove. In disseminated aspergillosis, the fungus penetrates the respiratory tract and may travel to other organs via the bloodstream, creating a more serious fungal invasion. German Shepherd Dogs seem to be predisposed to this type of dissemination. Signs experienced by the patient depend on where the fungus settles. Bone infection is common, and the intervertebral discs of the spine also tend to be favorite spots forAspergillus. This means that clinical features commonly include lameness, weakness, and incoordination. Frequently, there are draining tracts (holes with pus or bloody discharge oozing out) in the areas of infection. Fever, weight loss, appetite loss, and uveitis (deep inflammation of the eye) are also features. Sadly, most dogs are already terminally ill by the time they are first examined. Diagnosis is tricky. Bone destruction patterns on radiographs may be suggestive of fungal infection. If you’re lucky, the organism can be identified in some of the draining fluid or in a tissue sample. If the organism is not visible, it may be cultured from a fluid or tissue sample. Ideally, there would be a blood test forAspergillusantibodies that could make the diagnosis non-invasively, and while such antibody tests exist, it is hard to interpret them. There are accuracy issues, plus different species ofAspergillusdo not cross-react, so one must test separately for eachAspergillusspecies. Treatment is particularly frustrating for disseminated aspergillosis. At present, posaconazole seems to be the best choice, but years of treatment are likely required (very likely the medication will be for life), and many dogs still die of their disease before the medication can get the condition controlled. If the body part involved can be surgically removed (such as amputation of a bone), this can be curative, and, as distasteful as it may sound, aggressive surgery could be a dog's only chance of survival.

Category: Babesia Infection in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most people have never heard ofBabesiaorganisms, though they have caused red blood cell destruction in their canine hosts all over the world for thousands of years.Babesiaorganisms are spread by ticks and are particularly significantto racing greyhounds and pit bull terriers. Humans may also become infected. There are over 100 species ofBabesia,but only a few are found in the U.S. and are transmissible to dogs.Infected red blood cells are identified and destroyed, thus killing theBabesiaorganisms within them, but, unfortunately, if many red blood cells are infected, this leaves the host with anemia, a lack of red blood cells.Babesiaspecies continue to be classified and sub-classified worldwide. TheBabesiaspecies that infect dogs in North America are: How Infection Happens and what Happens Next Infection occurs when aBabesia-infected tick bites a dog and releasesBabesiasporozoites into the dog’s bloodstream. A tick must feed for two to three days to infect a dog withBabesia.The youngBabesiaorganisms attach to red blood cells, eventually penetrating and making a new home within the cells. Inside the red blood cell, theBabesiaorganism sheds its outer coating and begins to divide, becoming a new form called a “merozoite” which a new tick may drink in during a blood meal. Infected pregnant dogs can spreadBabesiato their unborn puppies, and dogs can transmit the organism by biting another dog as well. (In fact, forBabesia gibsoni, which is primarily a pit bull terrier infection, ticks are a minor cause of infection, with maternal transmission and bite wounds as the chief routes of transmission.) Having a parasite in your red blood cells does not go undetected by your immune system.Infected red blood cells are identified and destroyed, thus killing theBabesiaorganisms within them, but, unfortunately, if many red blood cells are infected, this leaves the host with anemia, a lack of red blood cells.Often the host’s immune system will begin destroying the uninfected red cells as well, a condition calledimmune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). Signs include weakness, yellowing of the soft tissues ("jaundice"), fever, and red or orange-colored urine. Making matters worse is the fact that animals seem to get sicker than the degree of anemia would suggest so there is more to this infection than the destruction of red blood cells. The severe inflammation that is associated with this parasitism can be overwhelming and completely separate from the anemia. Platelet counts can drop, impairing normal blood clotting (especially a problem withBabesia gibsoni). An assortment of neurologic signs of can occur withBabesiainfection when parasites gather inside the central nervous system and generate a more localized focus of inflammation. In severe cases, there is a lung injury similar to what people with late-stage malaria can experience.Babesia conradaeseems predisposed to creating liver disease. If the acute signs are relatively mild or at least non-lethal, a chronic infection can develop. This is usually without signs, but the dog may continue to be a source of infection by feeding ticks. Relapses can also occur in times of stress. Because babesiosis is a tick-borne infection, it is not unusual for infected dogs to have other tick-borne infections such asEhrlichiosis,Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and others. These infections may interact to make each other more severe. Young dogs tend to be most severely infected, especially pit bull terriers. Diagnosis of Babesiosis With luck, theBabesiaorganisms can be seen on a blood smear.Babesia canisorganisms are tear-shaped and occur in pairs. OtherBabesiaspecies have several forms in which they appear. The odds of finding the organism are improved by checking freshly drawn blood taken from a capillary source (a small cut to an ear, for example) rather than from a blood vessel. IfBabesiaorganisms are found, the patient is definitely infected but in most cases, they are not found so an alternative method of diagnosis is needed. Antibody testing has been problematic as infected animals may have circulating antibodies long after the organism is gone or may have no antibodies circulating while the few organisms remain hidden inside red blood cells. The newest method of diagnosis involves testing forBabesiaDNA. This type of testing is called PCR testing and is extremely sensitive, able to distinguish four different species.This is especially valuable information as the different species are sensitive to different medications. Current recommendations are to do both antibody testing (serology) as well as DNA testing (PCR) as the information is felt to be complementary. If a patient is strongly suspected to be suffering from babesiosis, treatment should begin promptly without waiting for test results. After treatment is completed, PCR testing should be repeated starting 60 days post-treatment and again two to four weeks after that. BabesiaTreatment Before 2004, an assortment of unpleasant drugs were used againstBabesiawith mixed success. What medications you will need to use to treat aBabesiainfection turns out to depend on which species ofBabesiathe patient is infected with. There are twoBabesiaspecies that are particularly challenging:Babesia gibsoni(the one that involves primarily pit bull terriers) andBabesiaconradae(theBabesiafound only in Southern California). Since 2004 a new protocol has emerged forBabesiaof either thegibsoniorconradaespecies using atovaquone and azithromycin in combination. These two medications stop reproduction so that the host's immune system has time to gain the upper hand and remove the organisms without their numbers increasing. Side effects are few to none, and improvement is generally obvious within the first week. Unfortunately, atovaquone is expensive, and pharmacies are reluctant to sell less than an entire bottle. It is often tempting to use the version of atovaquone that comes combined with proguanil, another anti-protozoal drug, but this version has not been evaluated thoroughly againstBabesiaand is famous for inducing severe nausea in dogs. Imidocarb, one of the earlier treatments, can be started while the correct formulation of atovaquone is obtained; it is best not to use azithromycin alone during that time, or resistance may develop. If atovaquone simply proves too expensive, the patient can be treated with imidocarb as was done in the past until such a time that it is possible to save up for the atovaquone/azithromycin protocol. Imidocarb creates a remission from the physical illness for an extended time but does not actually clear the infection. If imidocarb is employed, a single dose is usually effective forBabesia canisbut two given two weeks apart are needed for the smallerBabesiaspecies. The injection is painful, plus it causes muscle tremors, drooling, elevated heart rate, shivering, fever, facial swelling, tearing of the eyes, and restlessness. Pre-treatment with an injection of atropine helps palliate these side effects. Occasionally a strain ofBabesia gibsoniis resistant to atovaquone. When this happens, imidocarb can be used as described above with the addition ofdoxycycline,clindamycin, andmetronidazolefor a three-month period. ForBabesia canis, two doses of imidocarb, as described above, should generally completely clear the infection. The use of atovaquone appears to be unnecessary. A vaccine is available againstBabesiain France but only seems effective against certain strains. Vaccination is 89% effective in France. The best prevention is aimed at tick control. Racing Greyhounds Since areas where greyhounds are professionally raced tend to be areas with ticks, racing greyhounds are commonly infected withBabesia. Whether these infections become active remains to be seen as the carrier state seems to be common in infected dogs. As racing greyhounds end their careers and enter the adoption system,Babesiainfection is commonly screened. An apparently healthy but positive-testing dog can still be adopted with the understanding that active infection is unlikely but possible. Such a dog could transmit herBabesiainfection to other dogs via ticks or bite wounds and should certainly never be used as a blood donor. Human Babesiosis The species ofBabesiathat infect pets should not pose any problems to people with normal immune systems. People with compromised immune systems or people who have had their spleens removed may have some concerns. In the U.S., babesiosis usually occurs on the East Coast and along the Great Lakes and stems from tick bites. Most signs are mild or easily treated, but a five percent mortality rate has been reported. The usual organism isBabesia microti.

Category: Bacterial Diarrheas in Puppies & Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bacterial diarrheas are generally a nuisance for the adult animal but can be lethal to a small puppy, kitten, or even a human baby. Most of these problems stem from contaminated food or fecal contaminated environment.Feeding raw food dietsto pets dramatically increases the exposure to infectious organisms to the humans in the family. Since these conditions are also human diseases, it is helpful to have some understanding of what they are, even if there are no young pets or immune-suppressed individuals (human or otherwise) at home. Campylobacter Campylobacterspecies are a group of bacteria capable of causing diarrhea in dogs, cats, humans, and other animals. They have a unique curved appearance under the microscope and are said to be sea gull-shaped.  They are difficult to isolate as they grow in conditions of low oxygen (making them microaerophilic as opposed to being aerobic or anaerobic bacteria). With regard to pets,Campylobacterare generally a problem for the very young. Puppies and kittens have not yet matured immunologically. Plus, because they are small, fluid loss from diarrhea hits them much harder. Furthermore, puppies and kittens are more likely to be housed in groups where fecal cross-contamination is common so they may be more likely to become infected than adult animals. Adult animals commonly haveCampylobacterorganisms living in their intestines, but they do not experience any sickness due to it. In humans,Campylobacterinfection is a leading cause of gastrointestinal (GI) disease; infected dogs and cats can carry the organism and spread it even if they do not have symptoms themselves.  For this reason, pets used for therapy in assisted living communities and similar situations should be screened forCampylobacterby fecal culture before exposure to people with suppressed immunity. Humans are also infected by consumption of contaminated food, water, or raw milk; only 6% of humanCampylobacterinfections are attributed to dog exposure.  That said, exposure to a dog with diarrhea triples a person’s risk for developing enteritis fromCampylobacterjejuniorCampylobacter coli. Studies screening pet animals for inapparentCampylobacterinfections have found surprisingly high incidences of inapparent infection. In one study in the Midwest, 24% of 152 healthy cats were positive, for example. After consuming Campylobacter organisms, they travel to the lower small intestine, attach, and multiply. They produce a toxin that destroys the lining of the intestine with the result being a bloody, mucous diarrhea (though occasionally a more watery diarrhea is described).  Sometimes a fever results, appetite becomes poor, and vomiting can occur.  Incubation is 2 to 5 days.  The organism can survive as long as a month in environmental feces. Diagnosis is made by seeing the sea gull-shaped organisms under the microscope; however, there are so many bacterial organisms on a fecal sample that finding the culprit can be tricky. For this reason, a culture is often performed as a more accurate test. Because the organism is microaerophilic, specific culture requirements must be met; the facilities of a reference laboratory are needed. Treatment is with appropriate antibiotics, such aserythromycin,chloramphenicolortylosin. Salmonella Most people are somewhat familiar withSalmonella.They know it represents a type of food poisoning, probably know it is associated with diarrhea that can be severe, and may even know thatSalmonellaspecies are bacteria. Most human cases ofSalmonellainfection cause fever, diarrhea, and cramping that go away on their own, but in children, it can produce more severe disease. As withCampylobacter, the young are more susceptible to more severe illness because they are smaller and do not have mature immunity.  The same is true with puppies and kittens; adult animals are almost never affected bySalmonellainfection. An important exception to the "Salmonella is rare in adult dogs" rule is the case of dogs fed a raw food diet. It has become popular to feed raw foods to pets with the idea that a raw food diet more closely approximates the natural diet that the feline or canine body evolved to consume, and thus, such a diet should be healthier than commercially prepared foods. In fact, cooking food is central to removing parasites, bacteria, and bacterial toxins from food. A recent study evaluating raw food diets found that 80% of food samples containedSalmonellabacteria and that 30% of the dogs in the study were sheddingSalmonellabacteria in their stool. Adult dogs are often asymptomatic, but any infected animal or person will shed the organism for at least six weeks, thus acting as a source of exposure to other animals or people.Salmonellaorganisms are difficult to remove from the environment and easily survive three months in soil. Again, dogs used for therapy around the elderly or children should be cultured forSalmonella. There are two syndromes associated withSalmonella:diarrhea and sepsis.Salmonellabacteria, once consumed, attach to the intestine and secrete toxins. The toxins produce diarrhea that can be severe and even life-threatening in the young. If this were not bad enough, someSalmonellacan produce an even more serious “part two" (sepsis) should these bacteria invade the body through the damaged intestine, causing a more widespread and much more serious infection. In young animals, the syndrome resulting is similar to that of canineparvovirusthus similar treatment is expected. E. Coli Escherichia colimay be the most common bacterial organism in the world. It lives in our intestines naturally and covers the world we live in. Unfortunately, some strains ofE. coliare not so neighborly and are capable of producing diarrhea via toxin production. Like the other organisms we have discussed, this is a serious problem for the very young and more of a nuisance for adults.  There are three main types of unfriendlyE. coli:EnterotoxicE. coli, enterohemorrhagicE. coli,andenteropathogenicE. coli. EnterotoxigenicE. coliis a common cause of diarrhea in young animals as well as human infants and is responsible for the famous traveler’s diarrhea. These bacteria produce what is called an enterotoxin in the upper small intestine. This toxin, similar to the toxin of cholera, causes the intestine cells to secrete the body's fluid into the intestine, creating spectacular watery diarrhea and what can be life-threatening dehydration for smaller living creatures.  Young pigs, cattle, and other livestock are commonly lost to this kind of dehydration. Again, the younger and smaller the patient is, the more serious this infection is. EnteropathogenicE. colialso produce diarrhea in humans and animals. Rather than a secretory diarrhea as above, they simply destroy the intestinal cells where they attach. Diarrhea still results, but it creates more damage to the intestinal lining. EnterohemorrhagicE. coliis similar to enteropathogenicE. colibut with more associated inflammation. This type does not seem to be a problem for small animals though they can carry it asymptomatically. It would seem that antibiotics would be the obvious treatment for a bacterial disease, yet forE. coliit is surprisingly controversial. It seems that the use of antibiotics can enhance the synthesis of toxins by these bacteria; plus, oftentimes, antibiotic use only serves to makeE. colimore resistant in the GI tract. Antibiotics are generally reserved for those animals (or people) who seem the most sick or who have evidence of bacterial invasion in the bloodstream. Basically, treatment is supportive care until the patient's immune system regains the upper hand. In Conclusion Bacterial diarrheas are an especially serious consideration in the very young and in the weak or compromised, be they human or non-human. It is not unusual for apparently healthy animals to carry these organisms and shed them into the environment and feeding raw foods greatly increases the risk of this kind of latent infection. If you are considering raw food diets, especially if someone in the home is very young or has a compromised immunity, discuss prevention of these infections with your veterinarian.

Category: Basic Virology
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English This virology review is meant to help the beginner understand how viral infections work and how we survive them. Virology is a complicated subject, as is immunology, and the following is meant as a sort of kindergarten of terms and events. We think it is helpful in understanding the biology of what happens with viral infections. What is a Virus? Viruses are strange life forms. They have only the bare bones of biochemical equipment, barely enough to even qualify for the title of life form. Some Definitions: Viral Particle One little individual virus is called a viral particle. Viral particles are so small (some are the size of a large protein molecule) that we cannot really call them creatures; they are more like particles, hence the term. The word virus is more correctly applied to a species or genus of the virus rather than to the individual particles. Capsid The nucleic acids (the DNA or RNA) within the viral particles are surrounded by a protein coat and sometimes by an additional fatty envelope. The capsid consists of this protein coat and any fatty layer. The capsid proteins are crucial to the virus' ability to attach and infect a host cell. Viruses that have fatty envelopes generally do not last long in the environment as the fat is easily disrupted; these viruses tend to require direct contact with fresh body secretions to transmit the infection. DNA DNA is the double-stranded nucleic acid (deoxyribonucleic acid) that serves as the blueprint for all proteins a cell can make. It enables the cell to live and function within a body. It essentially amounts to instructions on how to make different proteins. Messenger RNA When it comes time to make a protein, a DNA segment unzips its double strands, allowing messenger RNA to enter and bind. The messenger RNA forms a "negative" image of the DNA segment it is “reading.”  The messenger RNA then leaves the cell nucleus and travels out into the cell's main body, where its message is read by cell structures called ribosomes. Transfer RNA is another type of RNA that floats around the cell. Each piece of transfer RNA has only three base codes (as opposed to the messenger RNA which has many base codes and is a long strand). The piece of transfer RNA carries with it an amino acid that its code corresponds to. The ribosome looks like two round pieces attached together. The two pieces grab the strand of messenger RNA and sandwich it between them. The ribosome reads the first three codes on the messenger RNA and matches them to a piece of transfer RNA. It moves to the next three codes and matches them as well. With each match, the transfer RNA leaves its amino acid for the ribosome to bind to the next amino acid, so as the ribosome moves down the strand of messenger RNA, it creates a strand of amino acids based on the matching. As we know, a strand of amino acids forms a  protein molecule. This is how our cells make proteins. Transcription The act of messenger RNA taking down the protein code from the original DNA segment is called transcription. Translation The act of producing a protein from the segment of messenger RNA using transfer RNA is called translation. It is performed by the ribosomes mentioned previously. Viral Infections When the match is correct, the virus binds to the cell and injects its nucleic acids inside. There are several techniques that viruses use to accomplish this, but all involve the capsid. Once the viral particle has injected its nucleic acids into the host cell, the next activity is to manufacture messenger RNA for the cell to translate into protein. The proteins that the viral nucleic acids make will shut down the cell's normal function and convert the cell into a factory for viral particle production. Regardless of the tricks the virus uses to make messenger RNA, once the messenger RNA is made, the host cell is doomed. Ribosomes line up on the strand of messenger RNA, read it, and use transfer RNA to mass produce the protein coded. This will be a viral protein, and its action will be to shut down normal cell function and dedicate the cell to the production of viral capsid and viral DNA. Soon the host cell is little more than a bag of viruses. These viral particles either bud off the surface of the host cell or the host cell simply explodes, leaving millions of new viral particles to seek new host cells. The only way to stop this process is for the immune system to recognize the infected cell early and destroy it before virus production becomes too advanced. Infected cells express viral proteins, shapes that the immune system can recognize. Within the body are several groups of cells, all created to respond against a specific shape. For example, B lymphocytes, which live in our lymph nodes, transform into antibody-producing plasma cells once they encounter their destined antigen. They produce Y-shaped antibodies that flood the circulation and bind the viral antigen, thus preventing the virus from attaching to the host cell, clumping with other antibody-virus groupings to create a larger clump, which in turn attracts a cell called a macrophage. The macrophage is the body's "Pac Man," swallowing and digesting debris. Aside from antibodies, there are patrolling T-lymphocytes that identify viral or other inappropriate shapes on the surfaces of host cells. The T-cell can thus recognize a virally infected cell or even a cancer cell, attach, and destroy it before it causes harm. Hopefully, between T-cell and antibody attack, the viral infection is removed from the body, and the status quo resumes.

Category: Brucellosis from Raw Milk Consumption
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Recently a case of brucellosis was diagnosed in a Texas man from drinking raw milk from a licensed raw milk dairy.  Brucellosis is a bacterial disease of cattle that was very common in Texas 50 years ago but is now rarely found due to vaccination and testing.  However, it is still in some areas and the bacteria is transmitted in the milk as well as fetal fluids at calving to other animals and people.  There are also other diseases that can be carried in raw milk, which is the reason for pasteurization as this process kills the organisms. Raw milk is not pasteurized.  Other animals commonly affected with brucellosis include sheep, goats, pigs and others.  The disease can also cause fistulous withers that is a draining tract at the withers in horses and is a cause of infection of the vertebrae indogs. In humans, symptoms include fever, sweats, decreased appetite, headache, pain in muscles and fatigue, or basically flu-like symptoms that do not respond to normal treatment.  The condition is called undulant fever in humans because it can recur for long periods of time and can cause heart valve infection, swelling of the liver and spleen and abortion in pregnant women. Brucellosis is a very serious disease in animals and people and drinking raw milk should be discouraged as the risks of developing disease are not worth taking the chance.   Death rarely occurs with the disease but many people have recurring symptoms that can last a lifetime, which was common before antibiotics were discovered.  Fortunately, today the disease responds to antibiotics in most humans.  However, drinking raw milk or feeding it to your pets, just like feeding raw meat to your pets, is dangerous for you and your family and is not worth the risk.

Category: Brucellosis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Brucellosis is an important venereal disease in many species. It does not usually come up in pet ownership because most pet dogs are not bred. Once someone decides to breed their dog, though, they should know all about this disease, particularly since it can be transmitted to humans. All dogs to be bred should have a brucellosis test. Active stud dogs should be tested every 6 months. If you are planning to breed your dog, test your dog and insist that the owner of your dog's mate produce results of a recent test for your inspection. Which Type ofBrucella There are ten species ofBrucellaand whileBrucella canisis of most concern for dogs. Dogs can certainly become infected withBrucella abortusfrom cattle;Brucella melitensisfrom goats; andBrucella suisfrom pigs if they are allowed to drink contaminated milk or eat leftover birth membranes, contaminated meat, or aborted young. OtherBrucellaspecies areBrucella ovis, which affects only rams,Brucella neotomae, which affects desert mice,Brucella microtiwhich affects rodents and voles, Brucella cetiandBrucella pinnipedialis, which affect marine mammals, andBrucella inopinata, which has only been found once in a human breast implant infection. Luckily for people,Brucella caniscauses much less serious disease in humans than the livestockBrucellabut the health department still considers anyBrucellainfection reportable. How Dogs get Infected Dogs like to stick their noses in all sorts of nasty places. They also chew up all sorts of disgusting things. Brucellosis can be contracted sexually, but it can also be contracted by inhalation (sniffing contaminated urine or fetal membranes), through the eyes, or orally (licking contaminated urine or urogenital secretions or chewing up fetal membranes). Urine and saliva from an infected dog are not nearly as rife with organisms as urogenital secretions; it is when breeding and/or whelping is in the picture that the transmission risk becomes high. When a female dog aborts a pregnancy because of aBrucellainfection, she continues to secrete fluids packed withBrucellabacteria for four to six weeks. Brucellaorganisms are able to survive in the environment for months if conditions are moist, cool, and dark. Bleach is an effective disinfectant in the environment. What Happens After Infection? The organism requires three weeks on average to become evident in the bloodstream. After that, it localizes in the reproductive or urinary tract and either continuously or periodically seeds the bloodstream from there. Lymph nodes can enlarge and possibly the spleen or liver can become inflamed but generally the infected adult dog does not seem sick in the short term. Chronic disease from long-term immune stimulation can result. Diseases produced by long-term inflammation can include: Most of the time, the only sign is aborted pregnancy between the 45thand 59thday of pregnancy (relatively late in the pregnancy). Classically, the aborted pups appear to have died at least several days prior to abortion as they do not look freshly dead. Abortion does not always appear in this most common form, though. Sometimes, the pregnancy is lost so early in its course that the problem is mistaken for infertility. Sometimes, puppies are stillborn. Sometimes, they are born live and infected. Testing Direct culture of the organism from a dead puppy, infected dog’s blood or from secretion is confirmatory but the organism is difficult to isolate in this way. This means we usually depend on immunologic tests. Which test is selected depends on what the test is being used for. Screening before BreedingThe RSAT (rapid slide agglutination test) is a test that can readily identify negative dogs. That is, if the test comes out negative, the dog can be considered negative. If the test comes out positive, further testing is needed. Up to 60% false positives occur. A test kit is available inside the veterinary hospital and some facilities can perform this test while you wait. The IFA (Immunofluorescent Antibody) test is a similar screening test, but it must be sent to the reference laboratory. The same guidelines apply negative means negative, and positive means do further tests. That said, if there is a classic history (such as an aborted litter of puppies) along with a positive IFA test, it may not be necessary to do further testing, as the situation is clear. Further Testing for RSAT or IFA Positive DogsThere are two tests that fit in this category. The most specific test (meaning the most trustworthy positive value) is the AGID (agar gel immunodiffusion) test. A version of the test called the CPAGID, named for the bacterial protein it detects, is the most accurate of all. Another test is called a TAT (tube agglutination test). It looks for antibodies againstBrucella canis. Antibiotic treatment with tetracyclines can drop antibody levels low enough for the TAT to be negative but this does not necessarily indicate that the infection has cleared. At this time the CPAGID is favored over TAT. If a dog is to travel to Australia, a TAT test is required as part of the travel documentation.If a dog is to travel to New Zealand, an AGID test is required as part of the travel documentation. Treatment First and foremost, the dog in question must be removed from the breeding program by either spay/neuter or euthanasia. The dog can remain as a pet but probably should not be sold due to potential health risks to potential buyers. If the dog is to remain as a pet, there are several considerations that must be observed: 1)BRUCELLOSIS IS CONSIDERED TO BE A PERMANENT INFECTION!This means that precautions against human exposure must be maintained for the life of the animal. 2) The dog should be confined to the owner's property for life. This means that veterinary services should be provided by a house call veterinary service and grooming services should be provided by a mobile service. Obviously, these service providers should be warned about the dog's condition so that proper protective gear can be employed. 3) The dog canNEVERhave contact with pregnant women, children, elderly people, people on chemotherapy or anyone considered to have a compromised immune system. Most human cases are mild and flu-like, but certain "at risk" human populations can have more serious consequences. 4) No exposure to any other dogs. All body secretions of an infected dog and contagious. 5) The infected dog will need to be on antibiotics (see below) as long as tests are positive. Ideally, testing (such as gel immunodiffusion) should be done monthly. Antibiotics can be discontinued as long as tests are negative but they will invariably become positive again eventually necessitating more antibiotics. ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENTS Tetracyclineand StreptomycinIn this regimen, tetracycline is given twice daily for a month, and injectable streptomycin is given daily for the first and last week of the month. In one study, over half the dogs were considered cured with this regimen, but currently, streptomycin is difficult to come by (as it is considered old-fashioned and has few uses at this time). Minocycline and StreptomycinMinocycline and doxycycline are derivatives of tetracycline that can also be used to treat brucellosis, but neither is effective when used alone. Again, four weeks of treatment is needed. Minocycline is used once daily while the aminoglycoside is used daily during the first and last week. Lack of availability of streptomycin has been a problem in treating this condition. Aminoglycosides such as gentamycin have been proposed as substitutes but they are not as effective. Quinolone antibiotics such asenrofloxacinhave also been proposed as substitutes, and are much less toxic than aminoglycosides; they may emerge as the best replacement for streptomycin. Doxycyclineand an AminoglycosideThis regimen requires daily injections of the aminoglycoside antibiotic for the first and last weeks of a four-week course of treatment. The aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics that has some very real negative effects on the kidney and so a longer course is not without risk. Monitoring may be needed. Newer literature suggests replacing the aminoglycoside with rifampin. Because of the potential for human exposure, euthanasia has been encouraged for dogs confirmed to be positive. In some states, euthanasia of positive dogs is mandatory. If you choose to keep a positive dog for a pet, see the links below to minimize contact with infected body fluids. KeepingBrucella Out of the Kennel A new dog for a breeding kennel should be isolated for one month. TwoBrucellatests two to three months apart should be adequate to confirm negativity (it takes 8-12 weeks from infection for tests to turn positive). If an infection is detected in a kennel, the entire kennel population should be evaluated and re-screened every 3 months. The kennel should be quarantined until all dogs have tested negative three times with 3 months between tests. Positive dogs should be removed from the kennel.

Category: Chagas Disease in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Chagas disease is an infectious disease caused by a microscopic parasite calledTrypanosoma cruzi.This parasite cannot infect mammals on its own and instead is spread by an insect called the kissing bug, or, more formally, thetriatomine.Kissing bugs spread the parasites through their feces. If the bug bites a dog and then defecates nearby, parasites can infect the dog through the open wound from the bite. Dogs can also be infected by eating kissing bugs, as the parasites enter the body through mucous membranes like the gums.   Once the parasite infects an animal, if it is not treated promptly, it can reproduce and live in the body for the rest of the animal's life. Chagas has been a serious problem in humans and dogs in South America for many years, but recently there have also been cases reported in the southern United States. Signs of Infection Chagas has three stages after the animal has been infected: acute, latent, and chronic. Acute Phase During the acute phase, the parasite enters the dog's body and begins to infect macrophages, a type of white blood cell. Macrophages normally travel all through the body to fight infection and the parasite, hidden inside these cells, can move about undetected. When it reaches the heart, it begins to multiply and damage heart cells. The parasite can also infect many other body systems, including the nervous system, liver, kidneys, spleen, or lymph nodes. Most animals only have mild symptoms at this stage, such as slight fever or low energy, although dogs younger than six months are more likely to be severely affected. This stage generally lasts for several weeks and throughout this time, there are many parasites in the blood and tissues. Unfortunately, due to the lack of visible symptoms, acute phase infections of Chagas are often missed. As a patient's immune system begins to fight the parasites, the number of parasites in the body goes down and the patient moves into the next phase of infection. Latent Phase During the latent phase, there are few parasites in the blood and the patient has no symptoms of illness. The immune system is generally not able to fully eliminate all the parasites in the body, but it keeps levels low enough that the patient doesn't feel sick. A Chagas infection at this stage is difficult to identify through laboratory testing because there are so few parasites in the blood. Some dogs may remain in the latent phase for the rest of their lives and will thus continue on without any symptoms. Chronic Phase Other dogs, however, will go on to the chronic phase of infection. We are not yet sure what triggers the chronic phase in some animals, but if the immune system becomes compromised through other diseases or injury, it can allow parasites to replicate again. As the immune system tries to fight against the growing number of parasites, it causes inflammation throughout the body, which can make the dog feel even sicker. Along with signs of systemic infection, like fever and lethargy, we also see symptoms of heart disease such as weakness, collapse, and, in severe cases, sudden death. Diagnosis Because Chagas disease is still relatively unknown in the United States, many cases are missed even after symptoms set in. Ask yourself the following questions to see if your pet is likely to have contracted Chagas: If your dog fits any of the above criteria and your veterinarian suspects Chagas, they may take a blood sample to send to a laboratory for molecular tests or to look at under a microscope. They may also take X-rays or use ultrasound to look at your dog's heart.   Treatment Drugs are available to fight the parasite infection and are quite effective during the acute phase. However, once the dog is in the chronic stage, it is no longer effective to only kill the parasites. Instead, the focus is on managing the symptoms of heart disease. Your veterinarian may recommend heart medications, prescription diets, or changes in exercise level. Chagas Disease In Other Species Although Chagas is also a serious condition in humans, your risk of contracting it from your dog is extremely low. You cannot get Chagas by being bitten or licked by an infected dog. The main risk to humans from dogs is for those who are handling infected blood samples, such as veterinary or laboratory staff. Chagas has been seen in both domestic cats and wild cats, such as bobcats. However, it appears to be less common in cats than it is in dogs. Research on the disease in cats is minimal, but if your cat is showing symptoms of heart disease, promptly inform your veterinarian. Prevention Research is being done on a canine vaccine for Chagas, but as of right now, it is not commercially available. Even if it were available, it only provides partial protection. If you live in an area where Chagas has been reported, you can take the following steps to protect your pets: Note that pyrethrin insecticides are toxic to cats in high doses. Spray insecticides are 1-5% pyrethrin, while most cats have symptoms of poisoning at concentrations around 40%, so pyrethrin sprays intended to be used outside are generally safe even if you have cats. Be sure to check the concentration of pyrethrin in the product you are using, store the container where cats can't access it and allow insecticides to dry fully before allowing cats to enter that space. Never apply a pyrethrin product directly to a cat. Being informed of the risk factors and symptoms of Chagas disease is the best way to ensure that your pets receive timely care. The earlier you catch the infection, the better your chances of reducing long-term complications.

Category: Chronic Bronchitis in Dogs is Neither Infectious nor Contagious
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Definition and Causes Chronic bronchitisis usually a non-infectious, inflammatory condition affecting the lining (mucosa) of the large airways (the trachea and bronchi) that results in a cough on most days for more than two months. In most cases, the specific cause of chronic bronchitis in dogs is not identified.  Chronic bronchitis is neither infectious nor contagious to other dogs; dogs will not pass it on to other dogs as they can in the acute form (see below). Acute bronchitis, on the other hand, is most often caused by infectious agents, such as viruses (e.g. parainfluenza virus, adenovirus,canine influenza virus,distemper virus, or bacterial agentsBordetella bronchisepticais the most common).  It is commonly termed kennel cough or canine infectious tracheobronchitis. Inflammation can also be caused by noxious irritants such as second hand smoke, foreign bodies, allergens (similar to hay fever in humans), foods allergens, and either migrating or primary lung parasites. In many of these cases, this acute bronchitis, occurring at the time of the infection or insult, will resolve with appropriate therapy from your veterinarian.  However, if the bronchitis persists long enough – generally, more than a few months – it is labeled chronic, and the cough itself can begin to cause and perpetuate airway inflammation. Clinical Signs Dogs with chronic bronchitis generally have a persistent hacking cough.  Some people describe it as sounding like a goose honking.  However, any trachea-bronchial inflammation/irritation can produce a similar sounding cough.  Often, the coughing occurs during the night or when the dog first starts to move around upon waking.  It also commonly occurs with excitement or exercise. Diagnosis Chronic bronchitis is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Other diseases can cause clinical signs similar to chronic bronchitis.  These includetracheal collapse,laryngeal paralysis, lung diseases, lung cancer,heart failure,heartworm diseaseand infectious causes of acute bronchitis (listed above).  Your veterinarian will likely attempt to rule out many of these causes with a history, physical examination, and additional testing. Diagnostic tests that are used to establish a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis include chest x-rays (thoracic radiographs), airway endoscopy (passing a small camera into the larynx, trachea and bronchi), collecting samples from the lower airways for culture and analysis of the cells in the airways (broncho-alveolar lavage or a transtracheal washing), and sometimes even echocardiography (examining the heart using ultrasound).  A fecal analysis might be needed to rule out parasites. Treatment Once a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis is made, your veterinarian will generally treat this condition with a variety of medications. There are several things to remember about treating chronic bronchitis: Treatment of chronic bronchitis generally relies on using a combination of medications: Your veterinarian might prescribe a combination of these drugs, and alter the doses as the disease is controlled to minimize side effects while still maintaining good control of the coughing. An important factor in successful therapy of chronic bronchitis is weight loss.  If your pet is overweight, a loss of even 5-10% of the body weight can dramatically improve the coughing.  When the dog is overweight, improving your dog’s condition is completely in your hands; therefore, your veterinarian might prescribe a weight-loss program for your pet in addition to the medications. Your veterinarian might also ask you to keep a “coughing log” to keep track of the severity and frequency of coughing, as this can help determine how successful the treatment is. Prognosis The prognosis for treating chronic bronchitis is good.  However, because this condition generally occurs in older dogs, other causes of chronic coughing (listed above) might complicate the management.  If coughing persists or recurs despite appropriate therapy, your veterinarian might be required to pursue other causes, or refer you to a specialist for additional diagnostic tests.

Brand name:Cipro Brands:Cetraxal, Cipro XR, Otiprio, Ciloxan, and Cipro in D5W Available in: Overview Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial (broad spectrum, systemic antibacterial agent) approved in humans for the treatment of susceptible bacterial infections. Fluoroquinolone antibacterials are synthetic. They were created because many bacteria have developed resistance to older antimicrobials. How Do Fluoroquinolones Work? Fluoroquinolones work by damaging bacterial DNA and can reach most infection sites. Vulnerable bacteria die quickly, and fluoroquinolones are excellent choices for many infections. However, when bacteria develop resistance to other antibiotics or fluoroquinolones, that resistance will prevent many other drugs from working. How This Drug Is Used Ciprofloxacin is available as an injection, immediate- or extended-release tablet, oral suspension, or ophthalmic. It is also available as a generic product that does not have a brand name. Ciprofloxacin may be compounded into a preparation that is specific to your pet. None of these products are approved for use in animals but are used “off-label.” Other fluoroquinolones have been approved for use in animals. Enrofloxacin is an example. It is very similar to ciprofloxacin. Because ciprofloxacin is very important in human health, your veterinarian may want to use a drug approved for use in animals. The injectable form is safely administered in a veterinary hospital. For the oral formulation, read and follow the prescription label carefully. Give this medication for as long as your veterinarian directs. Do not skip doses or stop giving the medication without consulting your veterinarian. Finish the entire course of treatment.If a dose is missed, give it as soon as you remember. If it is time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume the normal schedule. Ciprofloxacin is not well absorbed in dogs. Fluoroquinolones work best if a large amount of the drug reaches the bacteria all at once. If used in dogs, the dose must be very high. Usually, the dose only needs to be given every 24 hours. However, for difficult infections, the drug may need to be given every 12 hours. It is not absorbed in cats. Discuss with your veterinarian if this medication is to be given with food. If your pet experiences digestive upset after taking the medication, try offering a small amount of food. However, food can decrease the amount of drug that is absorbed. This drug is best used only if the cause of your pet’s bacterial infection is known. Your veterinarian may want to collect a sample from the infection in your pet for a culture and susceptibility report. This report will help decide if this drug will work against the bacteria causing the infection. Ciprofloxacin should not be used if the bacteria causing the infection have resistance to any fluorinated quinolone. Any drug used to treat infections will only work well if properly dosed. Your pet must receive the total dose prescribed of ciprofloxacin prescribed by your veterinarian. Interactions With Other Drugs Antacids and other drugs containing high amounts of calcium, aluminum, magnesium, or iron will decrease the absorption of this drug. Safety In Pregnant and Nursing Animals No risks to the fetus have been seen, although drug transfer through the placenta occurs. Discuss this concern with your veterinarian. Potential Side Effects Although rare, allergic reactions can occur. If your pet shows signs of irregular breathing, rash, fever, swelling, or anything else unusual, stop the medication and contact your veterinarian immediately. In immature dogs (less than eight months of age), damage to developing joint cartilage can occur. This is rare and only seen in growing dogs. It is better not to use this medication in puppies unless the severity of the infection warrants it. Storage Ciprofloxacin tablets should be stored in a cool, dry place in the original packaging or bottle.Keep away from heat and sunlight. Concerns and Cautions This drug may not be as effective if: Tell your veterinarian about any other medication your pet is receiving. This includes drugs or supplements. Do not use this drug with: Reach out to your veterinarian if your pet experiences severe vomiting or diarrhea.

Category: Clostridium difficile Becoming more Common in North America
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What IsClostridium difficile? Some strains contain genes that allow them to produce toxins. It is the toxins, not the bacteria themselves, that make a person or an animal sick. They can form spores, which can survive for years in the environment and are resistant to many disinfectants. If ingested, the spores germinate and the bacteria begin to grow when they reach the intestine. How Common IsClostridium difficile? HumansIn developed countries,C. difficileis the leading cause of infectious hospital-associated diarrhea in adults and accounts for 15-25% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is becoming more common in North America. The most important risk factor forC. difficileinfection (CDI) is treatment with antibiotics. The antibiotics affect the normal “good” bacteria in the intestine, which sometimes allowsC. difficileto take over and grow faster. Old age, certain cancer treatments, long hospitalization, some acid-suppressants used to treat stomach ulcers, intestinal surgery, and some other procedures also increase the likelihood of CDI. A hyper-virulentC. difficilestrain (ribotype 027/NAP1) has emerged in North America, Europe, and Japan, and has been responsible for epidemics of severe illness in hospitalized patients. Recently, severe illness due to CDI has been reported in some healthy, non-hospitalized people as well. AnimalsA small percentage of healthy dogs and cats (0-4%) carryC. difficilein their intestine. But in puppies, kittens, animals in breeding colonies, and dogs that visit human hospitals, the percentage may be higher (up to 30%). The bacteria can also be found in other types of pets, but it is unknown how common this is. How Do Animals And People Become Infected WithC. difficile? Clostridium difficilelives in the intestine of people and animals. When the bacteria are passed into the stool, they form spores that can survive in the environment for a long time. The bacteria are transmitted when the spores are ingested. This typically happens when there is stool contamination on something a person touches, and then the person touches their nose or mouth. Contamination of food and water can also be a problem. It is unclear ifC. difficilecan be transmitted from pets to people. The types ofC. difficilefound in pets are often the same as those found in people, including the epidemic strain ribotype 027/NAP1. So it makes sense thatC. difficilecould potentially be transmitted between people and animals, but there is still no conclusive proof. For now, it is best to err on the side of caution and considerC. difficiletransmissible between pets and people until proven otherwise. What Happens If A Person Or Animal GetsClostridium difficileInfection (CDI)? HumansIn people, CDI (which is also sometimes calledC. difficile-associated disease, or CDAD) may cause no illness at all, or anywhere from very mild to very severe diarrhea. Additional complications can also occur, particularly in people who are already sick for another reason. In some cases, the disease can be fatal. AnimalsThe vast majority of dogs and cats that carryC. difficilein their intestine do not become ill. However, there does appear to be a link betweenC. difficileand diarrhea in dogs in some cases, and there is one report ofC. difficilepossibly causing diarrhea in two cats. In most of these cases the diarrhea is mild, and clinically appears the same as diarrhea due to other common causes. Occasionally, more severe illness and diarrhea may occur. How IsClostridium difficileInfection Diagnosed? In animals and people, CDI is diagnosed by testing the stool for the toxins that are produced by the bacteria. Just findingC. difficile(by culturing the stool, for example) does not mean that it is causing a problem because not all strains can produce toxins. Even strains that can produce toxins don’t produce them all the time, so the bacteria can be found in perfectly healthy people and animals. Detecting the toxins themselves is the key. Testing animals that do not have diarrhea forC. difficileis not recommended. How IsClostridium difficileInfection Treated? In humans, many cases of CDI are caused by treatment with antibiotics for some other infection. In mild cases, diarrhea may resolve with no additional specific treatment. In severe cases, other antibiotics may be needed to controlC. difficile. Probiotics are not considered effective for the treatment of CDI in humans. Some (if not most) cases of CDI in pets resolve without additional antibiotics. If the animal has a lot of diarrhea it may need to be given fluids to prevent dehydration. There is no vaccine available forC. difficilefor any species. If you (or your pet) develop diarrhea while being treated with antibiotics, tell your physician or veterinarian right away. However, it is very important you only stop or change the medication you are taking or giving to your pet if you are told to do so by your physician or veterinarian. Otherwise, the infection for which the antibiotics were originally prescribed may get worse. What Do I Do If My Pet Is Diagnosed WithClostridium difficile? For surfaces that can’t be bleached, thorough cleaning is the most important step to physically remove as much contamination as possible. Steam cleaning is a reasonable way to reduce the number ofC. difficilespores that may be left in rugs, carpets, or similar floor coverings. Therapy Animals Visiting healthcare facilities is a risk factor forC. difficileshedding in dogs. However, it is unclear whether therapy pets that visit hospitals and nursing homes have an increased risk of developingC. difficilediarrhea. Healthy animals do NOT need to be tested or treated forC. difficile. There are guidelines available to help reduce the risk of pets acquiring infectious diseases in hospitals, which should be followed if your pet is part of a visitation program. These include If I HaveClostridium difficile, Should I Test My Pet? NO. Even if your pet was found to be sheddingC. difficilein its stool, you still would not know if it was the same strain you were carrying. This type of specialized testing is not readily available and is not indicated in most situations. If you haveC. difficile, you should be very thorough about washing your hands after using the washroom. Also try to prevent your pet from drinking from the toilet, if it tends to do so. The risk of disease to the general population posed byC. difficilein house pets such as dogs and cats is: Healthy Adults Individuals with compromised immune systems (e.g. HIV/AIDS, transplant, and cancer patients) are more susceptible to many kinds of infections, including those which may be transmitted by pets. While these individuals are not advised to get rid of their pets, precautions should be taken to reduce the frequency of contacts that could result in pathogen transmission (e.g. avoiding contact with any animal feces), as well as the ability of infectious agents to survive in the household (e.g. prompt and thorough disinfection of potentially contaminated surfaces). Infants and young children (less than 5 years old) are more likely than adults to extensively handle animals if given the opportunity, more likely to touch their faces or mouths, and less likely to wash their hands after handling an animal. Children may “snuggle” with pets such as dogs and cats; this very close contact can increase the risk of disease transmission. Young children should be supervised when playing with animals, and an adult should ensure that they wash their hands afterward, especially before handling food. Older children should be taught to do the same. It is important to note that infants less than 12 months of age are not affected byC. difficile. For these groups, the zoonotic risk posed byC. difficilein house pets such as dogs and cats is likely: Additional Information Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).Clostridium difficileinformationpage.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Clostridium difficileinfection.

Category: Clostridium perfringens Causes Diarrhea in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When pets get chronic diarrhea, one of the tests that sooner or later comes up is forClostridium perfringens.This bacterium produces an unpleasant toxin. The situation sounds simple: a pet gets infected with toxin-forming bacteria, gets diarrhea, and the diarrhea should at least improve when toxin-forming bacteria are removed. As with most things, the situation turns out to be more complicated. What isClostridium perfringens? Clostridial diseases are classic in medicine, both veterinary and human. It is aClostridiumthat causes tetanus and botulism, and clostridia are responsible for gangrene, “black leg,” lamb dysentery, and other famous maladies. Clostridia have several features in common that make them especially nefarious but most importantly: Clostridium perfringensis one of the brothers of the evilClostridiumfamily but is further classified into five biotypes (A, B, C, D and E) depending on what combination of four toxins it produces. Dogs are almost exclusively infected with biotype A. The toxins of significance that it can produce are called enterotoxins. We are particularly concerned about the alpha, epsilon, and net E/F toxins. These toxins can be seen in normal dogs, but if they are in high enough amounts, they are associated with diarrhea. How WouldClostridium perfringensInfection Happen? In order to produce toxin(s), the organism must form a spore (sporulate). Before it can do that, it must make its way into the host's intestine from the outside world. The organism enters the body orally: in food, grooming of fur, chewing up rotten dead things, etc. When the organism arrives in the small intestine, it forms a spore and begins to produce its toxin(s). Alternatively, the organism may have been happily and innocuously living in the intestine for who knows how long when something causes it to sporulate and produce toxin. The trigger may be dietary, may be related to infection with another organism, or may even be related to medications, especially antibiotics. The type of diarrhea produced is generally a colitis, meaning the large intestine is affected. Such types of diarrhea are mucousy, possibly bloody, and associated with straining. More watery diarrhea, as comes from the small intestine, is also possible. The severity of the diarrhea can range from mild to life-threatening, depending on how much toxin is produced. The important concept is thatC. perfringenstoxin can be the cause of chronic diarrhea, or it can be a complicating factor in diarrhea caused by something else. Can we Test for Toxin-Producing Strains OfClostridium perfringens? The culture will not tell us if the strain present can produce the enterotoxin. Clearly, we need to know more than whether there are anyC. perfringens.How aboutculturing forClostridium perfringens? Again, cultures are not very helpful.Clostridium perfringenscan be cultured from the feces of 80% of dogs, whether they have diarrhea or not. Some dogs seem to be unaffected. This is where PCR testing comes in; it is a form of DNA testing whereby theC. perfringensare tested for the DNA needed to make the different enterotoxins. In this way, we can detect the genes that are capable of producing enterotoxin. Furthermore, the number of gene copies can be measured so that we can tell if there are large or small amounts of toxin genes. Large amounts of toxin genes are associated with disease, so in this way, we can tell if one of theClostridium perfringensenterotoxins is likely to be contributing to the patient's diarrhea. There is also a test for the toxin, but it is an ELISA format, which means it is either negative or positive and does not say how much or how little toxin is present. In a perfect world, this test is combined with the test for the toxin-producing genes so as to confirm that not only are there large amounts of toxin genes, but they are confirmed to be producing toxin. The severity of the diarrhea can be mild all the way to life-threatening. When Should We Treat forClostridium perfringens? Let's begin with the obvious: a pet does not need to be treated forC. perfringensunless he has diarrhea. Since 80% of dogs harborClostridium perfringenswhether they have diarrhea or not, culturingClostridium perfringensfrom a fecal sample will not be adequate for diagnosis; we have to find the toxin or, at the very least, verify the presence of significant amounts of Clostridial genes capable of producing toxin. And all this must be found in a patient that actually has diarrhea. The chances are that a fecal check for worms has been done, and a trial course of an anti-diarrheal medication has been tried. A possible next step would be a PCR panel that detects the DNA from an assortment of viruses and bacteria associated with diarrhea. Often this type of panel includes a test for Clostridial enterotoxin DNA. The laboratory will report a quantification of gene copies for CPA (the gene for the alpha toxin), CPE (the gene for the epsilon toxin), and CP net E/F (the gene for the net E/F toxin). If the number of toxin genes for any of these toxins is significant, treating with antibiotics againstClostridiumis indicated. Keep in mind that Clostridial diarrhea might be the entire problem and curative with the right antibiotic or it might be secondary to a bigger problem yet to be discovered. Treatment for significant Clostridial diarrhea thus might yield only partial results. Treating the Toxin-Positive Dog with Diarrhea Any number of antibiotics can be used to remove it. Some choices include ampicillin,amoxicillin,metronidazole,erythromycin, andtylosin. Tetracycline was formerly on the list, but it has developed too much resistance.  IfC. perfringensis responsible for the diarrhea, a response to antibiotics is generally seen in a couple of days, but the full course of medication your veterinarian prescribed should still be completed.

Category: Cryptosporidium is a Particularly Challenging Type of Coccidia for Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What are Coccidia and Why they are Bad Coccidiaare a common parasite of young puppies and kittens. They reproduce inside intestinal cells, ultimately killing the cells within which they divide and producing nasty diarrhea when too many intestinal cells have been killed. As thecoccidiaincrease in number, so does the number of intestinal cells being killed. Potentially (for very small or immune-compromised pets), so many intestinal cells can be killed that the host animal dies from its severe bloody diarrhea. Survival is a matter of the host's immune system versus the dividingcoccidia. There are drugs that can kill certain types ofcoccidia,but forCryptosporidium,drugs just reduce the number of organisms and may not be able to clear the infection fully. (More on this later). Coccidiainfection is the scourge of the dairy industry, as it is one of the most common causes of calf death. This infection is similarly a nightmare for small puppies and kittens. Generally speaking, carnivores like dogs and cats get infected withCystoisosporaspecies,while livestock (goats, sheep, calves, and even rabbits) getEimeriaspecies, and these species ofcoccidiado not cross over.  Cryptosporidium vs. "Garden Variety" Coccidia The easiest way to understandCryptosporidiumspecies and how they cause disease is to think of them as another kind ofcoccidia.Cryptosporidiumhave some uniquely unpleasant features, however, that are not shared by routine species ofcoccidia. How Infection Occurs Out in the world,Cryptosporidiumoocysts (the infective stage shown below) are very tough. They resist bleach and most other normal cleansers. Only prolonged exposure to ammonia or extreme temperatures can kill them. This photograph depicts the oocyst releasing sporozoites after it has been swallowed by its new host (as described below). The sporozoites are the stage that kills intestinal cells. The life cycle of this organism is rather complicated, and it is not necessary to understand all the stages. The short version is that an oocyst (sort of like an egg) is passed in the feces of an infected animal. This oocyst is swallowed by another animal by licking the dirt off its fur, drinking contaminated water, or some such activity. The oocyst releases sporozoites (sort of like a spore) into the intestinal tract of the new host. The sporozoite infects an intestinal cell and divides. The spores divide into other stages with other names, which in turn infect more cells. All this cell division occurs asexually for a while until, eventually, theCryptosporidiumbegins a sexual phase: instead of making more copies of itself by simple cell division, it produces male and female cells. Fertilization occurs, yielding oocysts like the egg that started it all. There are actually two types of oocysts: one that is thick-walled and ready to be passed in feces to face the external world, and one that is thin-walled and just infects the host over again from the beginning. This is an important and bad thing so we will say it again: the thin-walled oocyst infects the host over again from the beginning. No contaminated water is needed. No dirty fur is necessary. This is now a self-perpetuating infection. If there is any good news in this, it is that most hosts have healthy immune systems and are able to coexist with low numbers ofCryptosporidiumwithout diarrhea. As will be seen, it is unlikely that medications will eradicateCryptosporidium; the goal in therapy is to eliminate diarrhea rather than clear the organism completely. How Rare is this Parasite? The prevalence ofCryptosporidiumoocyst shedding in dogs has varied from 2% to up to 15 -20% in stray dog populations. Fecal specimens from 200 stray dogs impounded at the San Bernardino City and County animal shelters were screened forCryptosporidiumoocysts, and 2% of dogs were found to be oocyst positive. A similar survey of 206 cats revealed oocyst shedding in 5.4%. Most infections are subclinical, meaning that the host animal is not sick. Humans tend to get their own species of it (Cryptosporidium hominis), while cats and dogs each have their ownCryptosporidium. Pet ownership has not been found to be a significant risk for humans with cryptosporidiosis (i.e., most infected humans get infected from other humans or from livestock). This is generally good news except for the immunosuppressed owner, who might adopt an infected pet without knowing it. Remember, in the immunosuppressed individual, cryptosporidiosis can be serious, so a screening test for a new pet is a good idea in this situation. Screening for Infection A routine fecal flotation test, as is recommended once or twice a year for most pets, is likely to missCryptosporidium.There are two main reasons: first,Cryptosporidiumis extremely small, and second, oocysts are only intermittently shed. At this time more specialized testing such as PCR testing forCryptosporidiumDNA or ELISA tests forCryptosporidiumproteins are the best way to go, but these tests were developed to detect theCryptosporidiumspecies that infect humans so there may be some issues with test sensitivity. Screening routinely forCryptosporidiumis probably not warranted for healthy animals unless they are going to be spending time with immune-compromised individuals. Treatment The bad news is that treatment is difficult. Nothing can really be described as highly effective. A medication called paromomycin has effective but is highly toxic to the kidneys. A medication called nitazoxanide has been effective but causes nausea and diarrhea.Azithromycinandtylosinalso have activity againstCryptosporidiumand are sometimes used. Fortunately, most infected animals have healthy immune systems and, even though medication may not be fully effective, the patient's own immune system is usually able to control, if not fully curtail, the infection. Many animals appear to carry this organism without symptoms. The U.S. Public Health Service and the Infectious Diseases Society of America both recommend that HIV-infected individuals should not bring into their homes: See more details onpet-related guidelines for HIV-positive individuals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) has information on preventing infections from pets. CDC tip: Protect yourself against gettingCrytosporidiumfrom animals. Simply wash your hands with running water and soap after any contact with animals and animal feces (stool).

Category: Distemper in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Canine distemper virus, also referred to as CDV, canine morbillivirus, and hardpad disease, is a highly contagious disease affecting not just dogs but many animals. Distemper occurs worldwide, and dogs are the primary carriers of the disease.  Canine distemper virus can sometimes occur along with other respiratory infections, including bacterial diseases such asBordetella bronchiseptica, andStreptococcus equisub.zooepidemicus, fungal diseases likeMycoplasmaspp., and viruses, including canine influenza virus, respiratory coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and herpesvirus. CDV is commonly spread through droplets or spray from the nose and mouth, such as through sneezing or coughing. However, infected dogs can shed the virus in nearly all bodily fluids. CDV is carried to local lymph nodes within 24 hours of contact with cells in the airways and lungs. Within a few days, the virus spreads to the spleen and abdominal lymph nodes, then spreads through the blood to cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, urogenital tract, and central nervous system (CNS). The CNS tissues are typically infected by day eight or nine when neurological signs can be seen. When the body’s immune system is triggered by exposure to disease, it reacts by producing antibodies. These antibodies are made up of proteins that attack the virus or bacteria causing the infection, hopefully protecting the body from getting sick. How strong your dog’s immune system is will play a big part in how sick they become after exposure. If an animal’s immune system can be activated to begin making antibodies to fight CVD by the 14thday after exposure, the signs of the illness may not be noticed. Dogs with mild to intermediate immune responses and delayed antibody titers (this means your dog may test negative on distemper tests but still have the infection) will develop clinical signs. While the virus can eventually be cleared as antibody levels rise, it may persist for extended periods in the eye, the central nervous system (including the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord), and some skin tissues (e.g., footpads). By days nine to 14, dogs without good immune responses tend to experience severe clinical signs and can die suddenly. Diagnosis Diagnostic testing starts with a physical exam and includes bloodwork, antibody tests, cytology/histopathology of affected tissues, X-rays, cerebral spinal fluid analysis, eye exams, and PCR testing. Sometimes, unfortunately, a CDV diagnosis can’t be made prior to death, and a final diagnosis can be determined only after a veterinary pathologist has examined the body.  Health History and Signs Dogs with mild distemper cases may exhibit a lack of energy, decreased appetite, fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and nasal discharge. Dogs with more severe clinical disease may show fever, nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, coughing, difficulty breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and dehydration. Secondary bacterial infections can occur and can make the signs worse. Your dog may also experience signs that the central nervous system is involved, such asataxia (incoordination), limb weakness,myoclonus (involuntary rhythmic muscle twitching), stiff neck, andhyperesthesia (skin sensitivity). These signs can occur at the same time or up to three weeks after the onset of CVD and typically get worse over time.Older dogs that have some immunity are more likely to have no signs or just mild disease. Eye problems includekeratoconjunctivitis sicca(dry eye),anterior uveitis (inflammation of the front part of the eye), and damage to the retina (which allows the brain to process sight). The optic nerves, which carry information to the brain from each eye, may developoptic neuritis (swelling and inflammation), leading to blindness. Skin problems in puppies includepustular dermatitis (blister-like sores that can be chronic), and the skin of the nose or toe pad can develophyperkeratosis (skin thickening). When this happens in the toe pads, it is referred to as hardpad. Infections in puppies can causeenamel hypoplasia (damage to the developing teeth).Cardiomyopathy, or enlargement of the heart muscles, which may lead to cardiac issues, is possible. Growing puppies have developedhypertrophic osteodystrophy,(when bones in the legs grow abnormally), causing pain. Abortion and stillbirths can occur in pregnant dogs. Ulcers of the mouth can occur, but they tend to be rare. Clinical signs will vary, depending on which strain of the distemper virus is involved and how well your dog’s immune system responds to the infection. Older dogs that have some immunities are more likely to have no signs or just mild disease. Puppies and animals with no immunity are more likely to have severe clinical signs. Treatment And Management Currently, no specific treatments are available for CDV. Supportive care can include fluid therapy, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, lung treatments for bronchopneumonia, anti-nausea and vomiting medications, steroids, anti-seizure medications, etc. Supportive care will vary, depending on which parts of your dog’s body have been affected. Prognosis The prognosis depends on the viral strain and your dog’s immune response. Older dogs with a good immune response may not have symptoms or a mild disease. Puppies or those with a poor immune response tend to develop more severe disease. The most important factors affecting your dog’s prognosis are neurologic. The prognosis for dogs that have neurological problems (the brain, spinal cord, and other nerves are affected) is guarded to poor, and there is a 50% chance of death. Dogs that recover may be immune to reinfection for long periods and may be immune for life. Prevention Hospitalized dogs with CVD must be isolated from other dogs. Dogs usually shed the virus in urine, stool, saliva, nasal mucous, etc., for one to two weeks after the initial infection. Dogs with neurologic signs can shed the virus for longer periods of time. Extended quarantine may be necessary to prevent the spread to uninfected animals. CDV is susceptible to many disinfectants. Talk with your veterinarian about how to best disinfect areas, dishes, and toys when your dog comes home. Good hygiene practices (e.g., handwashing, wearing gloves/protective clothing) are recommended when handling infected dogs. Vaccination Vaccination is crucial in preventing your dog from getting CDV. Current guidelines recommend vaccinating dogs at six to eight weeks of age and repeating the vaccine every three to four weeks until the puppy is 14 to 16 weeks of age. Dogs would then receive another vaccine one year after the initial series and then every three years afterward. Distemper antibodies that puppies could have received from their mother’s milk (colostrum) in the first few feedings, and that could prevent the vaccinations from working, are typically gone by 12-14 weeks of age. In dogs that are more than 16 weeks old, the initial vaccination series can consist of two vaccines given two to four weeks apart. The majority of dogs develop protective antibody levels within one to two weeks following vaccination. Zoonotic Potential A zoonotic is a disease that can be transferred from animals to humans. There is some concern that humans might be susceptible to the canine distemper virus because of recent CDV infections in primates. Because CDV is similar to the human measles virus, additional concern has been raised because of the decrease in routine measles vaccination by many humans. However, at the time of this writing, no evidence exists that CDV can infect humans.

Category: Ehrlichia Infection in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What isEhrlichia? Ehrlichia, named after Dr. Paul Ehrlich, who first described them, are a type of bacteria that infects and live within the white blood cells of their hosts. Different types ofEhrlichialive in different types of white blood cells. Hosts can be humans, pets, or wild animals.Ehrlichiaare spread from host to host by tick bites, and their intracellular location makes them difficult to remove as most antibiotics do not penetrate to the inside of cells. The twoEhrlichiaof concern areEhrlichia canisandEhrlichia ewingii The CrazyEhrlichiaName Game (We're Making Sure You're on the Right Page) Ehrlichiawere originally grouped according to the type of white blood cell they attacked. By findingEhrlichiainside certain types of white blood cells, one could get a better idea of which type ofEhrlichiaone was seeing. Or so we foolishly thought. We thought Why are we telling you this? Because your veterinarian may be using older names depending on which system they were trained with. If your dog has been diagnosed withAnaplasmosis,read that article instead of this one. Ehrlichia canisInfection (also Called Canine Monocytic Ehrlichiosis) Ehrlichia canisinfection is a worldwide disease. In the U.S., it is spread by the bite of the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). It is unknown how long the tick needs to remain attached in order to transmit theEhrlichiaorganism but the previously accepted idea of 48 hours is probably outdated and a much shorter time is more likely. It is important to realize that this tick can transmit other tick-borne infections (BabesiosisandRocky Mountain Spotted Fever) so infection with multiple organisms is not unusual. It can be difficult to separate which symptoms go with which tick-borne infection. Ehrlichia caniswas not well scrutinized until the Vietnam War when military German Shepherd dogs in the war zone began dying in large numbers from an infection that appeared to wipe out all their blood cells.  This condition, called "Tropical Canine Pancytopenia," was studied and found not to be limited to Southeast Asia. In fact, it had been in the good old U.S.A. all along. It turned out that German Shepherd dogs get a much more severe form of the disease so it wasn't until large numbers of German Shepherd dogs were infected together that the disease could be defined. In the 1980s it became clear that people could also be infected byEhrlichia, though not the sameEhrlichiaas for dogs. When the human disease was recognized, research intensified. For information on the human disease, visit:https://www.cdc.gov/ehrlichiosis/index.html When Dogs Get Sick:EhrlichiaSymptoms There are three phases of illness with ehrlichiosis: acute, subclinical, and chronic. Acute PhaseThis phase occurs one to three weeks after the host is bitten by the tick. TheEhrlichiaorganism is replicating in this time period and attaching to white blood cell membranes. During the acute infection, the platelet count will drop, andimmune-mediated platelet destructionwill occur. The dog will be listless, off food, and may have enlarged lymph nodes and/or spleen. There may be fever and even neurologic symptoms as well, but although the dog may seem pretty sick, this phase of infection is rarely life-threatening. Most dogs clear the organism if they are treated in this stage, but those that do not receive adequate treatment will go on to the next phase after 1 to 4 weeks. Subclinical PhaseIn this phase, the dog appears normal. The organism has sequestered in the spleen and is essentially hiding out there. Dogs can stay in this phase for months or even years. The only hints thatEhrlichiamight be hiding are a somewhat reduced platelet count and/or elevated blood globulin level (the protein portion that includes miscellaneous antibodies.) Long-term stimulation of the immune system will elevate globulins, sometimes dramatically. Not all dogs ever progress to the chronic stage, but when they do, the prognosis is worse. Chronic PhaseIn this phase, the dog gets sick again. Up to 60% of dogs infected chronically withEhrlichia caniswill have abnormal bleeding due to reduced platelet numbers. Deep inflammation in the eyes, called uveitis, may occur as a result of long-term immune stimulation. Neurologic effects may also be seen.Glomerulonephritis, resulting in serious urinary protein loss, can also result. Increased globulin levels are almost always seen in this stage, albumin is often low. Most dogs in the U.S. do not show full pancytopenia (literally reduction in all blood cell lines) but severe cell deficiencies are associated with high mortality rates. Ehrlichia ewingiiInfection (also called Canine Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis) Ehrlichia ewingiiis a different species of theEhrlichiagenus. It infects the white blood cells known as granulocytes and is not generally as serious asEhrlichia canis. Dogs are usually only mildly ill or may appear uninfected, but classically, symptoms include swollen, stiff joints, arthritis, and fever. Ehrlichia ewingiiis spread by the bite of the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum). How the Diagnosis is Made There are two main tests forEhrlichia: PCR testing forEhrlichiaDNA or blood testing forEhrlichiaantibodies. Antibody testing has been the main diagnostic for many years, but the recent availability of PCR testing has changed the approach. Of course, if lucky, the organisms will be seen on a blood smear, which clinches the diagnosis. Antibody TestingTraditionally, when ehrlichiosis is suspected, a blood test for antibodies againstEhrlichiaorganisms can be ordered or performed in minutes using an in-house test kit. There are some limitations to antibody testing. A positive test indicates that the dog has been exposed toEhrlichiabut does not necessarily imply an active current infection. A negative titer does not fully rule outEhrlichia, either, as a very sick patient may be too ill to produce antibodies, and an early case may not yet have started to produce them. Antibody titers can be measured in the laboratory, which makes it much easier to track progression; the in-house test kits are simply either positive or negative, and a numeric value is not provided. It takes six to nine months after infection for antibody levels to begin to drop. Antibodies againstEhrlichia canisandEhrlichia ewingiiwill cross-react, so it is not easy to determine which organism a dog has been exposed to. PCR TestingRecently PCR testing for the presence ofEhrlichiaDNA has become available. Commonly a laboratory will offer a tick panel, which uses PCR testing to screen for a group of classic tick-borne diseases. PCR testing remains positive for several weeks after the infection has cleared, as it does not distinguish between live and dead organisms. It takes time to clear dead organisms from the body. These two forms of testing are complementary, which means an antibody test can be used to screen dogs to identify those that have been infected. Treatment can be prescribed, and after the treatment has been completed and a couple of weeks have passed, the PCR test can check to see if the infection has cleared by testing for any residualEhrlichiaDNA. Treatment Doxycyclineis probably the most effective againstEhrlichia(and any other intracellular blood parasite, for that matter). Expect at least a month of treatment to be needed. The response is initially rapid (improvement is notable in the first few days). Dogs in the acute or subclinical stage at the time of treatment can expect to be cured. A common protocol involves 28 days on doxycycline and a PCR test 2 weeks post-treatment. If the test is negative, then another final PCR test is done in two months. If the post-treatment test is positive, another 28 days of doxycycline is used, and a two-week post-treatment PCR is repeated as before. If this second post-treatment PCR test is still positive, another medication (such aschloramphenicolor imidocarb) should be used. If immune-mediated secondary reactions toEhrlichiaare a problem (such as immune-mediated arthritis or immune-mediated platelet loss), corticosteroids such asprednisonecan be used to palliate the situation while the antibiotics are starting to work. Dogs in the chronic stage are more difficult to treat as they are sicker and more debilitated. A blood transfusion may be needed, and the mortality rate is much higher. Surviving dogs can become re-infected asEhrlichiaimmunity is not life-long.

Category: Giardia in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English See the article summary below. What areGiardia? Giardiaare single-celled organisms, infectious to many types of animals (including humans) all over the world. As you can see in the above image,Giardiaorganisms have little whip-like tentacles called flagella that classify them as flagellates. They use their flagella to move around from place to place, but when they find a spot where they wish to stay (like a cozy nook in the host's intestine), they use a suction cup-like structure (visible in the image) to attach. Their presence in the host intestine can cause diarrhea, though some hosts are symptom-free carriers. Different types ofGiardiainfect different types of animals; it is rare forGiardiafrom apet to transmit to a human; furthermore, dog and catGiardiaspecies are separate and are unlikely to cross from dog to cat or vice versa. Giardia have two forms: the trophozoite and the cyst. The trophozoite is the form that lives within the host, swimming around and attaching with its suction cup. The cyst, however, is the form that lives out in the environment. Trophozoites round up to cysts as they approach the colon and then are passed in feces. Trophozoites that don't round up into cysts and form a shell prior to passing into the cold, cruel world cannot withstand the temperature/moisture variability of the outside world. Cysts are the contagious stage. Trophozoites are in the parasitic stage. Life as aGiardiaOrganism As mentioned, trophozoites and cysts may be passed in fresh feces, but only the hard-shelled little cysts can withstand the conditions of the outside world. The cysts live in the environment (outside the host's body) potentially for months until they are consumed by a host. Inside the host, the cyst's shell is digested away, releasing two trophozoites into the intestine, and the cycle begins again. Contaminated water is the classical source of aGiardiainfection. When a fecal sample is analyzed, the appearance of theGiardiaorganism depends on whether the sample is freshly obtained or if it has been outside of the host's body for a while.Giardiaorganisms begin to round up into cysts in a matter of hours. The active trophozoites rather look like funny faces with the two nuclei forming the eyes and median bodies forming the mouth. Cysts look a bit more generic. In the environment, cysts survive in water and soil as long as it is relatively cool and wet. A host animal will accidentally swallow a cyst when drinking from a puddle, or toilet, or when licking fur. After the cyst has been swallowed, the cyst's shell is digested away, freeing the two trophozoites that go forth and attach to the intestinal lining. As mentioned, the trophozoitewill swim to a spot using its flagella and attach with its suction cup (more correctly called its "ventral disc").Trophozoitestend to live in different intestinal areas in different host species but will move to other areas depending on the diet the host is eating. Thetrophozoitemay round itself up and form a cyst while still inside the host's body. If the host has diarrhea, bothtrophozoitesand cysts may be shed in diarrhea; either form can be found in fresh stool. After infection, it takes 5 to 12 days in dogs or 5 to 16 days in cats forGiardiato be found in the host’s stool. Diarrhea can precede the shedding of theGiardia. Infection is more common in kennel situations where animals are housed in groups. How DoesGiardiaCause Diarrhea? No one is completely sure, but infection seems to cause problems with normal intestinal absorption of vitamins and other nutrients. Diarrhea is generally not bloody with aGiardiainfection. Immune-suppressive medications, such as corticosteroids, can re-activate an oldGiardiainfection. We do not know why some infected hosts get diarrhea while others never do. Diagnosis In the past, diagnosis was difficult. The stool sample being examined needed to be fresh, plusGiardiararely show up on the usual fecal testing methods used to detect other parasites. Several tricks have been developed to makeGiardiaeasier to find (special stains, using special processing solutions, etc.), but what has made the biggest difference in the diagnosis ofGiardiais the ELISA test kit, which is similar in format to a home pregnancy test. This method has dramatically improved the ability to detectGiardiainfections and the test can be completed in just a few minutes while you wait. Giardiashed organisms intermittently and may be difficult to detect. Sometimes pets must be retested in order to find an infection, and asymptomatic carrier animals are common. It should also be mentioned that the ELISA test can remain positive for some time after the infection has been eradicated so if re-testing is desired after a positive test, another test format may be more helpful than the ELISA test kit. Treatment A broad-spectrum dewormer calledfenbendazole(Panacur®) seems to be the most reliable treatment at this time.Metronidazole(Flagyl®) has been a classical treatment forGiardiabut studies show it to only be effective in 67% of cases. For some resistant cases, both medications are used concurrently. Febantel is also commonly used forGiardiaas it is converted to fenbendazole in the body. Because cysts can stick to the fur of the infected patient and be a source for re-infection, the positive animal should receive a bath at least once in the course of treatment. At the least, the patient should have a bath at the end of treatment, plus it is especially important to promptly remove infected fecal matter to minimize environmental contamination. Can Humans Be Infected? The short answer is only rarely, so the concern is pretty low in general. However, maintain good hygiene practices such as regular hand-washing and removing fresh pet fecal matter promptly, as mentioned. That said, here is a more detailed answer:Giardia duodenalisis classified into several subcategories called assemblages and designated A through G. Some assemblages are specific as to which host animals they can infect, and other assemblages are not so picky. Assemblage F, for example, only infects cats, and assemblages C and D only infect dogs but assemblage A will infect dogs, cats, people, rodents, wild mammals, and cattle. Common testing methods do not indicate what assemblage has been detected, so there is always a possibility of human transmission as long as the assemblage is unknown. Environmental Decontamination Giardiacysts are killed in the environment by freezing temperatures and by direct sunlight. If neither of these is practical for the area to be disinfected, a chemical disinfectant will be needed. Organic matter such as dirt or stool is protective of the cyst, so on a concrete surface, do basic cleaning before disinfecting. Quaternary ammonia compounds can be used to killGiardiacysts. Animals should be thoroughly bathed before being reintroduced into a clean area. A properly chlorinated swimming pool should not be able to become contaminated. As for areas with lawns or plants, decontamination will not be possible without killing the plants and allowing the area to dry out in direct sunlight. A Footnote on Vaccination A vaccine againstGiardiawas previously available, not to prevent infection in a vaccinated pet but to reduce the shedding of cysts by the vaccinated patient. In other words, the vaccine was designed to reduce the contamination of a kennel whereGiardiawas expected to be a problem. This would be helpful during an outbreak in a shelter or rescue situation but is not particularly helpful to the average dog whose owner wants to simply prevent infection. Because of the limited usefulness of the vaccine, manufacturing was discontinued in 2009. In Summary: Additional information from the Companion Animal Parasite Counsel (CAPC): DrontalPlus® is effective in treating Giardia in dogs when administered per label directions. CAPC Board majority opinion is that asymptomatic dogs may not require treatment.

Category: Heartworm Treatment for Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources It has been said that the treatment of heartworm infection is something of an art. There are several strategies that can be used depending on the dog's medical condition, including the option of not treating at all. The important concept to realize is that, while there are off label alternative heartworm-killing protocols, the FDA-approved method of killing adult heartworms involves very harsh arsenic-based drugs and killing large adult heartworms is neither simple nor safe. Let's review some of the dangers and options in clearing the body of this parasite. Patient Evaluation Prior to therapy, the heartworm patient is assessed and rated for risk into one of four categories. Important factors include: how many worms are thought to be present based upon the tests performed, the size of the dog, the age of the dog, concurrent health factors, severity of the heart disease, and the degree to which exercise can be restricted in the recovery period. Some hospitals use computerized formulas to categorize heartworm infected patients. The categories into which patients are grouped are as follows: Class I: Lowest Risk.These dogs are typically without symptoms and their infection is a surprise discovery during a routine annual health examination when a positive test comes up. Other blood tests are normal and radiographs show mild changes if any change at all. Class II: Moderately Affected.Healthy dogs with minimal signs as above, occasional coughing, fatigue only with exercise but with radiographs that show definite evidence of heart disease. Lab testing shows mild anemia, urine dipsticks show some protein present but not severe urinary protein loss. Class III: Severely Affected.Dog is suffering from weight loss, cough, difficulty breathing, and blatant damage to the vasculature is apparent on radiographs; lab work reveals a more severe anemia and marked urinary protein loss. The damage to the lung blood vessels from the worms creates extra resistance for the heart to pump against, and often, episodes of collapse occur with exercise. If the damage is severe enough, the heart can actually fail trying to pump through all the clogged-up blood vessels. Class III dogs are expected to die without treatment but are, unfortunately, sick enough that treatment itself is not without risk. Class IV: Caval Syndrome.Dog is collapsing in shock with dark brown urine evident. Heartworms are visible by ultrasound in the AV valve of the right side of the heart, with very abnormal bloodwork. These dogs are dying and can only be saved by the physical removal of adult heartworms via an incision through the jugular vein. If such a dog can be saved from this crisis, further treatment cannot be contemplated until the dog is stable enough to fit into one of the other categories above. In this video (we warn you this is not for the faint of heart), view the physicalremoval of adult heartwormsfrom the jugular vein of a dog with caval syndrome. After knowing what class the patient fits in, treatment can be determined. The dog has three groups of heartworms in their body: microfilariae (basically newborn worms whose parents are living inside the dog in question), newly arrived immature worms (relatively fresh from the mosquito bite and living in the skin tissues), and adult worms themselves. Microfilariae are the first stage larvae (basically the youngest stage). These are the children of the adult worms living in the heart and blood vessels. The mother worm gives live birth (no eggs involved) and the babies swim freely in the host's bloodstream. They must be killed so that they cannot be picked up by mosquitos and transmitted to new dogs.. The newly arrived heartworm larvae, freshly delivered from mosquito bites in the last 3 months. These are third and fourth stage larvae living in the skin. For practical purposes, we will include the L5 larvae in this group. The L5's are old enough to leave the skin tissues and enter the circulation but they are not really mature enough to be called adults. This group of young worms (L3's and L4's in the skin and L5's in the circulation) represent the first 5-7 months of infection. We need to kill them before they reach maturity and begin to wreak havoc on the cardiovascular system of the host. The older L5 larvae and adult worms live inside the heart and pulmonary arteries. This group requires the arsenic compounds for destruction while the other two groups can be killed with less toxic products. Now that it's Staged, Let's Get Rid of it The goal is to get rid of all three groups of worms with as little inflammatory reaction as possible. Since the adult worms are the largest, it is not surprising that their deaths generate the most inflammation. We hope to stage the worm-killing process so that when the time comes to kill the adult worms, there are as few adult worms as possible and the patient should be as healthy as possible going into the process. For the sake of terminology, adulticides are products that kill the adult worms and larvicides kill the immature worms. Stabilization First Expect strict exercise restriction to be needed after adulticide therapy but moderately affected dogs will need restriction from the first. If the dog has heart failure, this will need to be controlled as well. Some dogs will need anti-inflammatory doses of steroids to control the inflammation that stems from the presence of worms. This is often done concurrently with the second step as described below. Killing the Microfilaria and Migrating Worms The next step in treatment is clearing the migrating immature worms. Heartworm treatment is a project that lasts at least a couple of months. We do not want immature worms to mature in that time frame. Since our goal is to have fewer adult worms when the time comes to kill the adult worms, it behooves us to kill the younger worms right off the bat. The tissue-based L3 and L4 larvae are killed by monthly macrocyclic lactone-based heartworm preventive products (avermectins and milbemycin). Killing the L3 and L4 larvae prevents heartworm infection. Some of these products can also kill circulating microfilariae (which need to pass through a mosquito before becoming infective to other animals).  The only FDA-approved product for killing microfilariae after adulticide therapy is Advantage Multi®, which contains moxidectin. Other products can be used for this purpose also, but it should be noted that an anaphylactoid reaction can occur if a large number of microfilariae are killed rapidly with products such as high-dose ivermectin (off-label) or high-dose milbemycin (e.g., Interceptor). This problem has not been noted with Advantage Multi. While low-dose ivermectin products (e.g., Heartgard) will gradually eliminate microfilariae in most dogs, the package insert discourages it for this use. KillingWolbachia Wolbachiais a genus of rickettsial organisms (sort of like bacteria, but not exactly) that live inside heartworms of all developmental stages, but their numbers begin to expand once the young worms reach their infectious stage.Wolbachiaorganisms seem to be protective or beneficial to the heartworms that harbor them, aiding in metabolism and general worm health. WithoutWolbachiacolonization, many female worms are not able to reproduce, and third-stage larvae are not able to infect new hosts. Wolbachiaorganisms possess inflammatory surface proteins that are released when adult worms die or are killed in treatment, and these proteins greatly increase the chances of severe circulatory reactions in the canine host. It has been found that killingWolbachiawith an antibiotic such asdoxycyclineis helpful in treating the heartworm infection as theWolbachiacan be removed from their heartworm hosts, thereby weakening the worm and minimizing the release of inflammatory proteins when the worm finally dies. To minimize reactions, the American Heartworm Society recommends using doxycycline along with heartworm preventives for a good month as soon as the diagnosis is made and prior to the use of the arsenic compounds needed to kill the adults. Killing the Adult Worms he only product currently available for treating adult heartworms is melarsomine dihydrochloride (Immiticide®or Diroban®. If you go by the manufacturer's recommendations, treatment can be done in two or three doses, depending on the class of heartworm infection. Most universities, however, opt to treat all patients with the three-dose protocol as it creates a more gradual kill of the adult worms (which is safer in terms of embolism and shock). The patient receives an intramuscular injection deep in the lower back muscles. This is a painful injection with a painful substance, and it is common for the patient to be quite sore at home afterward. Pain medication may be needed. Be careful around the injection site, as the pet may bite. The site may form an abscess that requires warm compresses. Approximately 30% of dogs experience some injection site reaction. These generally resolve in 1-4 weeks. In the two-dose protocol, the dog returns for a second injection the next day on the opposite side of the lower back. In the three-dose protocol, the dog comes back one month later for two doses 24 hours apart (the first dose is an introductory treatment to kill some of the more sensitive worms.) Keep in mind that too many worms dying at once creates circulatory shock. The benefit of the three-dose protocol (sometimes called the split dose protocol) is that the first injection serves to kill off any older or weaker worms without killing off the stronger, younger ones. When the two consecutive doses occur one month later, there will be fewer worms dying at once. After treatment, the patient must be strictly confined for one month following the final treatment. No walks, no running around. The dog must live an indoor life. The reason for this is that embolism, to some degree, is inevitable, and it is important to minimize embolism-related problems. Exercise increases heart rate and oxygen demand, and we need the heart to rest during this recovery period. Watch for: If any of these occur, report them to the vet as soon as possible. The most critical time period is seven to 10 days following a melarsomine treatment, but these signs can occur anytime in the following month. The "Slow Kill Method" with Ivermectin Only Melarsomine treatment is expensive and often out of reach for rescue groups, shelters, and many individuals. If the dog is stable (Class I), one option is to simply leave the dog on an ivermectin-based preventive. This option has led to a great deal of misconception about the ability of ivermectin to kill adult heartworms. Let us lay the rumors to rest now: This means that if you opt to treat a heartworm-positive dog with only an ivermectin heartworm preventive, you can expect the dog to remain heartworm-positive for as long as two years and the heartworm disease will be progressing during that time. This is not good for the dog but certainly beats getting no treatment of any kind. The "Slow Kill Method" with Mox-Dox Adding doxycycline to ivermectin has changed the way slow kill works. As the "slow kill" protocol evolved, topical moxidectin has been substituted for ivermectin, and a month of twice daily doxycycline is used to kill theWolbachiabacteria that are so protective of the living heartworms. The result seems to be a much faster slow kill with microfilaria clearing three weeks or so (addressing the resistance in microfilaria issue of slow kill). The adult worms die over 3-4 months, which is similar to the 3-dose protocol (1-3 months on preventive, one dose of melarsemine with two doses following a month after that). Exercise restriction is still needed, and relatively high doses of moxidectin are also needed. (The topical product is essential; long-acting injectables wane too quickly). Heartworm antigen testing is performed nine months after starting the protocol and continued monthly until negative. If the dog is still heartworm antigen positive after 15 months, new decisions should be made (do mox-dox again, use melarsomine, etc.) The American Heartworm Society views this protocol as a salvage procedure, meaning that it could be considered for a dog for whom melarsomine is not an option. Research and controversy continue with regard to this method.

Category: Heartworm: The Parasite
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources What is a Heartworm? Heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) is a fairly large worm - up to 14 inches long - that, in adulthood, lives in the heart and pulmonary arteries of an infected dog. Dogs become infected through mosquito bites as mosquitoes readily pick up heartworm larvae from the blood of an infected dog and carry the larvae to new dogs. Some geographic areas have severe heartworm problems, while other areas have virtually none. In order for the parasite to establish its presence in an area, the following conditions must be met: When these conditions come together, an area becomes endemic for heartworm disease. Let's look at the heartworm life story in more detail. Heartworms live on the right side of the heart, the side that pumps blood through the pulmonary arteries and on to the lungs to pick up fresh oxygen. (In the graphic below, this pathway is outlined in blue.) The adult heartworm is fairly large, as mentioned up to 14 inches in length, and it prefers to live not in the heart, but in the pulmonary arteries. It swims into a cozy tubular artery where it is massaged and nourished by the blood coursing past it. In the pulmonary arteries of an infected dog, the worm generates a strong inflammatory response and a tendency for blood to inappropriately clot. If there are a lot of worms, the heart must work extra hard to pump blood around all the worm bodies. If the worm infection is a heavy one (over 25 worms for a 40-lb dog), the worms begin to back up into the heart's right ventricle, the chamber that pumps blood through the lung. The worms actually take up a significant amount of space within the heart, space that could have been taken up by blood. With less blood going through the heart, there is less blood being pumped out to the lung. When there are over 50 worms, the ventricle is completely full and the atrium, the chamber receiving blood from the rest of the body, begins to fill with worms. When there are over 100 worms, the entire right side of the heart is filled with worms and there is little room for any blood to be pumped. This drastic phenomenon is called caval syndrome and most dogs do not survive it. Microfilariae (First Stage Larvae)When adult male and female worms are there, mating begins to occur. Heartworms do not lay eggs like other worm parasites; instead, they give live birth, and the baby worms are called microfilariae. Microfilariae are released into the circulatory system in the hope that they will be slurped up by a mosquito taking a blood meal and carried to a new host. Microfilariae may live up to two years within the host dog in whom they were born. After this period, if a mosquito has not picked them up, they die of old age. Microfilariae can also be transmitted across the placental barrier to unborn puppies if the mother dog is infected with heartworm. The puppies may test positive for microfilaria, but they cannot get adult heartworms in their hearts in this manner. A heartworm cannot colonize the heart of a dog without having first developed in a mosquito's body. Parasitic worms have five larval stages and are termed L1, L2, L3, etc. Heartworm microfilariae are first-stage larvae, L1s. Note: Ivermectin, moxidectin, selamectin, and milbemycin-based heartworm preventives will readily kill microfilariae. Dogs on these heartworm preventives, even if infected with adult heartworms, usually will not test positive for microfilariae. Inside the MosquitoLet us continue to follow the young heartworm's development inside the mosquito that has taken it in with a blood meal. Within the mosquito's body, the microfilariae will develop to L2s and finally to L3s, the stage capable of infecting a new dog. How long this takes depends on the environmental conditions. In general, it takes a few weeks. A minimum environmental temperature of 57 degrees Fahrenheit is required throughout this period. The process goes faster in warmer weather, but if the temperature drops below 57 degrees, the mosquitoes will die, and no heartworms can be transmitted. Infecting a New DogWhen a dog is bitten by an infected mosquito, the L3 is not deposited directly into the dog's bloodstream. Instead, it is deposited in a tiny drop of mosquito spit adjacent to the mosquito bite. For transmission to occur, there must be adequate humidity to prevent evaporation of this fluid droplet before the L3’s can swim through the mosquito bite and into the new host. If the climate is dry, the droplet will dry out quickly, stranding the L3 larvae on the dog's skin, and transmission will not occur. Once safely inside the new host, the L3 will spend the next week or two developing into an L4 within the host's skin. The L4 will live in the skin for three months or so until it develops to the L5 stage and is ready to enter the host's circulatory system. The L5, which is actually a young adult, migrates to the heart and out into the pulmonary arteries if there is room, where it will mate approximately five to seven months after first entering the new host. Note: All commercially available heartworm preventives act by wiping out the freshly delivered L3s and the L4s living in the skin. The ivermectin products are also able to kill the younger L5s. Because the heartworm tests on the market either look for microfilariae or adult worm proteins, they will not detect infection with immature worms. This is why it takes five to seven months from the time of exposure to get a valid heartworm test and also why there is no point in testing puppies less than five to seven months of age.

Category: Hepatitis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Hepatitis? Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. It is a syndrome - a group of clinical signs or symptoms - rather than a specific disease, and it has many causes. Your dog can have immediate inflammation in their liver called acute hepatitis or long-term inflammation called chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis (CH), also called chronic active hepatitis, can lead to scar tissue formation and cirrhosis in the liver. Cirrhosis is extensive, end-stage scar tissue. Some dogs with acute hepatitis progress to the chronic form. Infectious Canine Hepatitis One disease that causes chronic hepatitis is infectious canine hepatitis (ICH). ICH is caused by a virus but not the same as the Hepatitis A, B or C viruses that cause disease in humans; you and your family won’t get sick if your dog is infected. Similarly, The hepatitis viruses that cause human hepatitis do not affect dogs. ICH is spread through animal feces, urine, saliva and objects. Since most dogs are vaccinated as puppies against ICH, it is considered a rare infection.If you have a young puppy or an unvaccinated dog in your household, they can get ill with this virus.However, outbreaks sometimes occur, mostly in dogs less than 1-year-old or unvaccinated dogs. An infected dog may show signs of depression, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Treatment involves supportive care such as fluids and medications to boost liver function; the latter may includeSAMe,milk thistle,ursodiol, and vitamin E. Causes Aside from ICH, there are many other causes of hepatitis. Causes of acute hepatitis include toxins, drugs, viruses, bacteria (particularlyleptospirosis), and fungi. On the other hand, chronic hepatitis is caused by bacteria, viruses, excess copper in the liver, drugs, and immune system issues. If a cause cannot be determined, this is referred to as idiopathic hepatitis and is the most common cause. Idiopathic means no cause can be found. Age and Breed Predispositions Any dog can have an acute episode of hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis, on the other hand, is most common in middle-aged to older dogs; most dogs diagnosed with chronic hepatitis are 4-10 years old. Some breeds are suspected to have a genetic predisposition to CH, making them more likely to develop it. These include the Bedlington Terrier, Doberman pinscher, West Highland white terrier, Dalmatian, English springer spaniel, American and English cocker spaniels, Jack Russell terrier, and standard poodle, Great Dane, Labrador retriever, and others. CH is also more common in females than males. Signs Dogs with acute hepatitis often have more severe signs than those with CH. Symptoms may include anorexia (lack of appetite), vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, depression, fever, and jaundice (yellow discoloration of the eyes, gums, and skin), enlarged abdomen and weight loss. How serious your dog’s symptoms depend on how much liver damage they have and this may vary from mild to severe. In severe cases, there are signs of bleeding and bruising. Bleeding can occur inside the body or through any opening of the body, such as the nose and mouth. Dogs with chronic hepatitis often appear normal early on. It is often surprising how normal the dog appears, even with significant progressing disease. This is why it is a good idea to pay attention to elevations in the liver enzymes (particularly ALT), as there is a better chance of slowing down the disease the sooner it is detected and appropriate management begins. As the disease gets worse, common signs are poor appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, increased thirst and urination, weakness, jaundice, and weight loss. A small number of dogs have severe signs such as bleeding, incoordination, and behavior changes. Similar to acute hepatitis, bleeding can occur through any opening in the body. Diagnosis Similar to many illnesses, a thorough history and physical examination from your veterinarian are crucial to making a diagnosis. Drug history and potential exposure to toxins are particularly important as these can cause significant liver damage. Some dogs with hepatitis have increased levels of liver enzymes that can be seen on lab work. These increases do not have to be large to be important; they may indicate liver damage but can also be caused by many different diseases. Elevated liver values are a common abnormality, but they are often non-specific and can be confusing to pet owners. Not all cases of elevated liver enzymes indicate specific liver disease. The liver performs many functions and, in some cases, the liver enzymes may elevate due to problems elsewhere in the body, or simply due to age. It is a good idea to look into these sooner rather than later, especially if your dog is one of the breeds predisposed to hepatitis. They may be the only abnormality a dog with chronic hepatitis has at that time. To add to the confusion, some dogs with hepatitis can have normal liver enzymes. This normalcy does not rule out chronic hepatitis: CH can be so severe in some dogs that there is little functioning liver tissue left to release enzymes, making test results look ‘normal.' If hepatitis is suspected, your veterinarian may recommend a serum bile acids test specifically to evaluate liver function. Another diagnostic test is an abdominal ultrasound. Abnormalities on these tests may strongly suggest hepatitis, but often do not pinpoint a cause. A liver biopsy is the most accurate way to make a diagnosis. Treatment Treating a dog with acute hepatitis involves supportive therapy such as fluids, medications and antioxidants. Treating chronic hepatitis has several goals: treat the underlying cause, reduce inflammation and scarring/cirrhosis, provide supportive care, and treat complications. This support may involve changing current medications, use of antibiotics, and medication meant to reduce excess copper. Steroids, and/or other immunosuppressive drugs, may be used to reduce inflammation if infection is not suspected. Supportive care works to boost liver function, while treating complications depends on the specific problems. Your dog may benefit from specific dietary changes depending on their individual condition and the cause of their chronic hepatitis. Dogs whose chronic hepatitis is associated with excess copper in the liver should be fed diets reduced in copper. They can also have a zinc gluconate supplement added to their food which acts to reduce copper levels as well. Regardless of cause, dogs with chronic hepatitis may benefit from diets with restricted protein levels. Restricted protein diets are not always necessary however and are only considered if your dog has evidence of protein intolerance. Your veterinarian will work with you to determine if your dog needs to be on a protein restricted diet. Another important dietary factor to consider for a dog with CH is how tasty and nutritious the food is. Dogs with CH often do not want to or are reluctant to eat. It's important your pet's food is appetizing to them and has high levels of carbohydrates and moderate levels of fat to provide them with their necessary calories. There is evidence that fiber may benefit dogs with liver disease and is another factor to consider increasing in your dog's diet. Prognosis Your pet’s prognosis depends on the underlying cause of their hepatitis. In general, acute hepatitis has a better prognosis than the chronic form. If the liver is not too damaged, most dogs recover. Some, however, progress to chronic hepatitis. According to one study, the average survival time with chronic hepatitis was two to three years, although individual results depend on the condition and response to treatment. Identification of the liver disease (via biopsies) is the best way to ensure the proper treatment. The prognosis is much worse if scarring and/or cirrhosis is extensive or blood clotting test results are abnormal. To ensure the health of your pet, it is important to not only treat hepatitis as soon as it is diagnosed, but also to look into abnormal test results such as elevated liver enzymes; these may be early signs of liver issues.

Category: Hepatozoonosis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hepatozoonosis is a parasitic infection of dogs primarily caused by eitherHepatozoon canisorHepatozoon americanum. The illness is difficult to treat and can be fatal in dogs showing symptoms. Both forms are transmitted from ticks and are debilitating. Without treatment, chronic wasting begins in either form, which usually ends with death within 12 months. Species ofHepatozoonare protozoans, which are a different kind of infectious organism than bacteria or viruses. Like ameba, protozoans are single-celled parasites that live in the environment. Although both species cause hepatozoonosis, the disease and recommended treatment are different. People cannot be infected by these protozoa. Transmission and Infection Ticks get infected by feeding from a host, and then transmit Hepatozoon protozoans to dogs when the dog ingests them. This is not a disease in which ticks biting the dog make it sick. The tick becomes infected with protozoans after it has a blood meal from an infected animal. This can occur by eating birds or rodents with infected ticks attached, or eating a tick on themselves. Infection does not occur because of a tick bite, and dogs are not infectious to each other. Hepatozoonprotozoans develop to a certain life stage in the tick to allow for infection of another animal. Dogs must eat the infected tick in order to become infected. Concurrent infection, debilitating disease, immunosuppressant drugs, and young age increase a dog’s chances of becoming infected and having symptoms. Symptoms of Infection H. canisandH. americanumhave different symptoms, ticks, life cycles, and prevalence.H. americanumcomes from dogs eating Gulf Coast ticks, and the brown dog tick conveysH. canis.Many dogs have mild symptoms, or none. When a dog is infected withH. canis, the protozoans reproduce and develop primarily in organs associated with blood storage (e.g. spleen) or the immune system (e.g. bone marrow, lymph nodes). You may see your dog not wanting to move around, and he may have fever, pale gums and skin, and enlarged lymph nodes. Many infected dogs do not have symptoms. Disease tends to be less severe than withH. americanum. Young dogs less than 18 months of age are most frequently affected byH. canis. H. americanumprotozoans tend to be a far more severe disease that reproduces and develops in muscles, including the heart. Cysts — thick, protective capsules — can form around the organisms, resulting in life-long infections. A dog’s immune system tends to respond more strongly to these protozoans compared to H. canis, leading to severe reactions. The infection can result in symptoms such as pain in the muscle, bone, and/or joints. Infected dogs may limp or be unable to walk, seem painful when touched, run a fever, and lose weight. Diagnosis A veterinarian will need to examine the dog to note all the physical abnormalities. Blood can be drawn to check immune cells, blood cells, and to make sure the internal organs are working properly. X-rays may help determine the extent of damage and rule out other diseases. Hepatozoonosis can sometimes be diagnosed by blood tests. Examining blood under the microscope can also be helpful for diagnosis. In many cases, a biopsy needs to be taken from infected muscle and examined by a pathologist to determine which protozoan is responsible for the infection. Treatment Treatment is difficult in dogs showing symptoms. Sadly, many dogs cannot be cured. Dogs infected withHepatozoonorganisms can be treated with medications that will decrease the severity of the symptoms, but return of symptoms is common. It’s more difficult to control symptoms inH. americanumthanH. canis. Pain medications, blood transfusions, and nutritional or fluid support such as intravenous fluids, syringe feeding, and high calorie diets may be needed for dogs with severe symptoms. Remember, treatment will not cure your dog, but can make him more comfortable and give him a higher quality of life. Prevention No vaccines are available for hepatozoonosis. The best method for prevention is aggressive, year round tick prevention, as well as keeping your dog from hunting and eating wild rodents or birds (often easier said than done). Treat the yard for ticks if it does not freeze in your climate. Remove ticks quickly from your dog to keep him from eating them.

Category: Influenza Strains in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Just like people, dogs can be affected by different strains of influenza A, a highly contagious respiratory virus. While dogs can sporadically become infected with influenza strains from other species (including human influenza viruses), canine influenza viruses are strains of influenza A that are host-adapted for dogs and spread effectively between dogs. There are two main strains of canine influenza known to affect dogs internationally. H3N8 was identified in the early 2000s but has rarely been identified in recent years. The main current concern is H3N2, a strain of influenza that originated in Asia and was introduced to North America multiple times through imported dogs. H3N2 canine influenza is different from human and swine H3N2 influenza viruses that are in circulation. Where have cases been reported and how prevalent is it? While the flu strain H3N2 has been identified sporadically in Canada and Europe, it persists in Asia and the US causing sporadic disease and some regional outbreaks. Influenza activity tends to be unpredictable, with few cases identified for prolonged periods of time, then numerous outbreaks in many regions. Outbreaks are most commonly associated with kennels, shows, and other situations where numerous dogs have close contact. H3N2 canine influenza has also been found in other countries. Overall, canine influenza is a rare cause of respiratory disease but is important because it can cause large outbreaks. What are the signs? Signs can range from inapparent infection (no clinical signs) to mild upper respiratory tract infection to pneumonia. Most often, infected dogs develop a cough. They may also be lethargic and have reduced appetite and a fever. Sneezing and discharge from the eyes and/or nose may also be observed. These signs are no different than those from other causes of canine respiratory disease complex, more commonly referred to as ‘kennel cough’. In a minority of infections, more severe disease can occur, either from more severe influenza infection or because of secondary bacterial pneumonia. These dogs can develop high fevers (104⁰F - 106⁰F, 40⁰C - 41⁰C; normal is 101⁰F - 102⁰F, 38⁰ - 39⁰C) and have clinical signs ofpneumonia, such as increased respiratory rates and effort. Fatal cases of pneumonia resulting from infection with influenza have been reported in dogs, but the fatality rate is less than 1-2 percent. Most dogs recover in two to three weeks. How is canine influenza transmitted? Influenza is transmitted mainly through direct contact between dogs and contact with respiratory secretions. Transmission via droplets and aerosols may also occur. Dogs can be infectious about one day before they seem sick. They are probably most contagious to other dogs shortly before and for the first couple of days of illness. Dogs with subclinical infections (dogs that are infected but don’t get sick) can also transmit the virus. When should I see the veterinarian and what are common treatments? The need to seek veterinary care is most dependent on the severity of the disease, not whether or not influenza is the cause. There are no specific treatments for influenza, and most dogs do not need special diagnostic testing or treatment. Sometimes, medications to control cough are needed. In a small percentage of cases, antibiotics may be needed to treat secondary bacterial pneumonia or diagnostic testing might be required to evaluate more severe diseases. While there are no specific treatments, knowing whether a dog has influenza can be important for infection control, identifying the cause of outbreaks, assessing vaccination requirements, and assisting with disease control measures. A dog living in an area where outbreaks are being reported should be considered to have canine flu until proven otherwise. Testing to confirm influenza may be most useful when trying to identify a group (e.g., kennel, show) problem rather than directing specific treatment for the dog Veterinary care should be sought if there are any signs of moderate to severe disease (e.g., difficulty breathing, uncontrollable coughing, severe lethargy, or anorexia). Canine flu is very contagious, so clinics might request that you come in through a separate entrance. Dogs with severe disease can require hospitalization with oxygen and fluid therapy, and testing such as chest radiographs (X-rays) to determine whether pneumonia is present. The very young and seniors (who may have compromised respiratory systems or concurrent diseases associated with age) may be more likely to have severe signs of illness. How is a diagnosis made? Influenza is usually diagnosed by swabbing the nose or throat and PCR testing. Viral PCR tests (polymerase chain reaction tests) use technology to detect the genetic material of viruses.  These can help your veterinarian to diagnose the cause of illness and determine the best treatment for your pet. Should my dog be vaccinated against influenza? There is now a vaccine that will protect against both H3N2 and H3N8 strains, as well as a vaccine that is just for H3N2. A booster is required two to four weeks later, and dogs should be revaccinated with one dose every year. It can be used in healthy dogs and puppies over 7 weeks of age. As with most infectious respiratory disease viruses, the vaccine does not protect completely against or eliminate the virus, but reduces how ill your dog can be with it as well as decreases your dog’s ability to transmit the virus to other dogs. As with human flu shots, a vaccine for one strain doesn’t help prevent another strain. The existing vaccine for H3N8 does not prevent H3N2. The vaccine for H3N2 does not protect against H3N8. A regular ‘kennel cough’ vaccination will not prevent influenza. To decide whether or not your dog should be vaccinated for either strain or for both, talk to your veterinarian about the likelihood of any dog being exposed in influenza (both where you live and areas you might visit with your dog) and the risk of severe disease should they become infected (e.g. seniors, pregnant dogs, dogs with compromised immune systems or underlying respiratory or heart disease). Can influenza be prevented? The best preventative measures are to limit or prevent exposure as lifestyle plays a factor in the risk of getting either strain of flu. Dogs that go to daycare, dog parks, performance competitions, dog shows, training classes, or boarding kennels have a higher risk. Dogs that spend most of their time at home or rarely encounter other dogs have a lower risk. People with dogs that might have influenza (or any similar respiratory disease) should keep them away from other dogs. Don’t let your dog socialize with coughing dogs. Can people or cats be infected by dogs? There is no evidence that people can get canine influenza. However, it is theoretically possible that dog-human transmission could occur or that canine influenza viruses could recombine with human or other species’ flu viruses to create a novel strain. Overall, the risks are very low. Owners of infected dogs do not need to isolate from their dogs.

Category: Kennel Cough in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease, CIRD, or Infectious Tracheobronchitis) What is it? Kennel coughis an infectious bronchitis of dogs characterized by a harsh, hacking cough that most people describe as sounding like “something stuck in my dog’s throat.” This bronchitis may not last long and be mild enough not to need any treatment, or it may progress to life-threateningpneumoniadepending on which infectious agents are involved and the patient's immunological strength. An uncomplicated kennel cough runs a week or two and entails frequent fits of coughing in a patient who otherwise feels active and normal. Uncomplicated cases do not involve fever or listlessness, just lots of coughing. Happily, most cases are uncomplicated. Appetite loss, labored breathing, and reduced activity can indicate progression to pneumonia. Again, it depends on the vigor of the patient versus the vigor of the infectious organisms. Numerous organisms (some of which may be prevented by vaccination) may be involved in a case of kennel cough; it would be unusual for only one agent to be involved. Infections with the following organisms frequently occur concurrently to create a case of kennel cough: The classical combination for uncomplicated kennel cough is infection with parainfluenza or adenovirus type 2 in combination withBordetella bronchiseptica. Infections involving thedistempervirus,Mycoplasmaspecies, orcanine influenzaare more likely to progress topneumonia, and pneumonia can readily result in any dog or puppy that is sufficiently young, stressed, or debilitated. Not sure what a Coughing Dog sounds like? Dogs can make assorted respiratory sounds. Usually, a cough is recognizable but it is important to be aware of another sound called areverse sneeze. The reverse sneeze is often mistaken for a cough, a choking fit, sneezing, retching, or even for some sort of respiratory distress. In fact, the reverse sneeze is more like the sound of clearing the throat, and usually stems from a post-nasal drip or “tickle in the throat.” It is considered normal, especially for small dogs, and only requires attention if it is felt to be “excessive". The point here is to know a cough when you hear one. A cough can be dry or productive, meaning it is followed by a gag, swallowing motion, and the production of foamy mucus (not to be confused with vomiting). Here are some videos that might help. Coughing Dog (with Productive Cough):Dixon has kennel cough Note: People who have viewed this video have compared it to what their own dog is doing, and concluded their dog has kennel cough. This video is meant to demonstrate coughing in general. It is important to note that there are many causes of coughing, and the nature of the cough does not generally reflect on its cause. Reverse Sneezing Dog:Maggie reverse sneezes  How Infection Occurs An infected dog sheds infectious bacteria and/or viruses in respiratory secretions. These secretions become aerosolized and float in the air, where they can be inhaled by a healthy dog. Obviously, crowded housing and suboptimal ventilation play important roles in the likelihood of transmission but organisms may also be transmitted on toys, food bowls, or other objects. The normal respiratory tract has substantial safeguards against invading infectious agents. Probably the most important of these is what is called the mucociliary escalator. This safeguard consists of tiny hair-like structures called cilia that protrude from the cells lining the respiratory tract and extend into a coat of mucus above them. The cilia beat in a coordinated fashion through the lower and more watery mucus layer called the sol. A thicker mucus layer called the gel floats on top of the sol. Debris, including infectious agents, gets trapped in the sticky gel and the cilia move them upward toward the throat where the collection of debris and mucus may be coughed up and/or swallowed. The mucociliary escalator is damaged by the following: Without this, a fully functional mucociliary escalator or invading bacteria, especiallyBordetella bronchiseptica, the chief agent of kennel cough, may simply march down the airways unimpeded. Bordetella bronchisepticaorganisms have some tricks of their own as well: Because it is common forBordetellato be accompanied by at least one other infectious agent (such as one of the viruses listed below), kennel cough is a complex of infections rather than infection by one agent. Classically, dogs get infected when they are kept in a crowded situation with poor air circulation and lots of warm air (i.e., a boarding kennel, vaccination clinic, obedience class, local park, animal shelter, animal hospital waiting room, or grooming parlor). In reality, most causes of coughing that begin acutely in dogs are due to infectious causes and usually represent some form of kennel cough. The incubation period is two to 14 days. Dogs are typically sick for one to two weeks. Infected dogs shed Bordetella organisms for one to three months following infection. How is a Diagnosis Made? A coughing dog with poor appetite, fever, and/or listlessness should be evaluated for pneumonia. Usually, the history of exposure to a crowd of dogs within the proper time frame, plus typical examination findings (coughing dog that otherwise feels well) is adequate to make the diagnosis. Radiographs show bronchitis and are particularly helpful in determining if there is a complicated pneumonia. Recently, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) panels have become available in many reference laboratories. Using technology to amplify the presence of DNA in a swab, the lab is able to test for most of the kennel cough infectious agents listed. This knowledge is helpful in guiding therapy and understanding expectations. How is Kennel Cough Treated? An uncomplicated case of kennel cough will go away by itself. Cough suppressants can improve patient comfort while the infection is resolving. The dog should be clearly improved, if not recovered, after about a week. That said, several infectious agents in the kennel cough complex are more intense and can cause minor bronchitis to progress topneumonia, which is a potentially life-threatening disease. Given this possibility, antibiotics are frequently prescribed to kennel cough patients to prevent or curtail pneumonia before it warrants hospitalization. It is important to distinguish an uncomplicated case of kennel cough from one complicated by pneumonia for obvious reasons. The uncomplicated cases will not have a fever or appetite loss, nor will they be listless. As mentioned, they will seem normal except for coughing. Dogs with pneumonia appear sick. Prevention through Vaccination Vaccination is only available forBordetella bronchiseptica, canine adenovirus type 2, canine parainfluenza virus, canine distemper, and canine influenza. Infections with other members of the kennel cough complex cannot be prevented. Vaccine against adenovirus type 2, parainfluenza, and canine distemper is generally included in the basic puppy series and subsequent boosters (the DHPP or distemper-parvo shot). ForBordetella bronchiseptica, vaccination can either be given as a separate injection or as a nasal immunization. There is some controversy regarding which method provides a better immunization or if a combination of both formats is best. Nasal VaccineIntranasal vaccination may be given as early as 3 weeks of age, and immunity generally lasts 12 to 13 months. The advantage is that local immunity is stimulated right at the site where the natural infection would try to take hold. It takes four days to generate a solid immune response after intranasal vaccination, so it is best if vaccination is given at least four days prior to the exposure. Some dogs will have some sneezing or nasal discharge in the week following intranasal vaccination; this should clear up on its own. As a general rule, nasal vaccination provides faster immunity than injectable vaccination. Nasal vaccines forBordetellagenerally also include a vaccine against parainfluenza virus and some also include a vaccine against adenovirus type 2. Oral Vaccine An oral vaccine is available forBordetella bronchiseptica(but not adenovirus or parainfluenza). The idea is that it is easier to give the vaccine with a syringe in the mouth - just inside the cheek - and there is no concern about sneezing out some of the vaccine. The oral vaccine can be given to puppies as young as eight weeks of age. The vaccine is given annually. Injectable VaccineInjectable vaccination is a good choice for aggressive dogs who may bite if their muzzle is approached. For puppies, injectable vaccination provides good systemic immunity as long as two doses are given (approximately one month apart) after age 4 months. Boosters are generally given annually. Some dogs experience a small lump under the skin at the injection site. This should resolve without treatment. Vaccination is not useful in a dog already incubating kennel cough. Bordetella bronchisepticavaccination may not prevent infection. In some cases, vaccination minimizes symptoms of illness but does not entirely prevent infection. This is true whether nasal, oral or injectable vaccine is used. Dogs that have recovered fromBordetella bronchisepticaare typically immune to reinfection for six to 12 months. What if Kennel Cough doesn't Improve? As previously noted, this infection is generally self-limiting. It should be at least improved partially after one week of treatment. If no improvement is seen after that week, a re-check exam (possibly including chest radiographs) would be a good idea. Failure of kennel cough to resolve suggests an underlying condition. Kennel cough can activate a previously asymptomaticcollapsing trachea, or the condition may have progressed to pneumonia. Alternatively, there may be another disease afoot entirely, such as non-infectiousbronchitis,congestive heart failure, or some other condition that causes coughing.

Category: Leptospirosis and Your Pet: A CDC Fact Sheet
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English ThisCenters for Disease Control & Prevention fact sheetis designed to assist pet owners in answering questions related to leptospirosis in pets. Leptospirosis is a disease that can affect human and animals, including your pets. All animals can potentially become infected with Leptospirosis. While for many years occurrence among pets was rare, the disease has been diagnosed more frequently in the past few years. See below for information on how to protect yourself and your pets from leptospirosis and what to do if your pet becomes infected. Infection The bacteria that cause Leptospirosis are spread through the urine of infected animals, which can get into water or soil and can survive there for weeks to months. Humans and animals can become infected through contact with this contaminated urine (or other body fluids, except saliva), water, or soil. The bacteria can enter the body through skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth), especially if the skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water can also cause infection. Infected wild and domestic animals may continue to excrete the bacteria into the environment continuously or every once in a while for a few months up to several years. If your pet has become infected, it most likely came into contact with the bacteria in the environment or was exposed to infected animals. Your pet may have been drinking, swimming, or walking through contaminated water. Because of increased building and development into areas that were previously rural, pets may be exposed to more wildlife, such as raccoons, skunks, squirrels, opossums, or deer that are infected with leptospirosis. Dogs also may pass the disease to each other, but this happens very rarely. Signs and Symptoms The clinical signs of leptospirosis vary and are nonspecific. Sometimes pets do not have any symptoms. Common clinical signs have been reported in dogs. These include: Generally younger animals are more seriously affected than older animals. If you think your pet may have leptospirosis, contact your veterinarian immediately. Your veterinarian can perform tests to determine whether or not your pet has the disease. Treatment If your pet has been confirmed by your veterinarian as having leptospirosis, the appropriate action to take will depend on the nature of contact with your pet. Normal daily activities with your pet will not put you at high risk for leptospirosis infection. Types of contacts that are considered to be high risk include: If you have had these types of high-risk contacts with your pet during the time of its infection, inform your physician. If common symptoms, such as fever, muscle aches, and headaches, occur within 3 weeks after a high-risk exposure, see your physician. Tests can be performed to see if you have this disease. Leptospirosis is treatable with antibiotics. If an animal is treated early, it may recover more rapidly and any organ damage may be less severe. Other treatment methods, such as dialysis and hydration therapy may be required. The time between exposure to the bacteria and development of disease is usually 5 to 14 days, but can be as short as a few days or as long as 30 days or more. Prevention in Pets To help prevent leptospirosis infection, keep rodent problems (rats, mice, or other animal pests) under control. Rodents can carry and spread the bacteria that causes this disease (seePrevent Rodent Infestations). Get your pet vaccinated against leptospirosis. The vaccine does not provide 100% protection. This is because there are many strains (types) of leptospires (the bacteria that causes Leptospirosis), and the vaccine does not provide immunity against all strains. It is important to get your pet vaccinated again even if it gets leptospirosis because it can still get infected with a different strain of leptospires. Pet owners should also take steps to prevent themselves and others from becoming infected with the disease due to an infected pet. The primary mode of transmission of leptospirosis from pets to humans is through direct or indirect contact with contaminated animal tissues, organs, or urine. In some instances, shedding of leptospires in the urine may persist for as long as 3 months after infection as a result of inadequate or lack of treatment. Always contact your veterinarian and your physician if you have concerns about a possible exposure to an infected animal.

Category: Leptospirosis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English About the Organism Leptospiraorganisms are spiral-shaped bacteria called spirochetes. There are several species of leptospires, but the ones that cause disease have been grouped into one particular species calledLeptospira interrogans sensu lato. From here,Leptospira interrogans sensu latohas been sub-classified into smaller related groups called serovars. Over 250 serovars have been named, and at least 10 are important for pets. A vaccine for dogs, however, exists against only four serovars. Different serovars produce different types of disease and are in different geographical areas. Canicola -This serovar is the most common in Mexico. It produces primarily kidney disease. With a constant influx of dogs across the border, watch out for this serovar in states near the Mexican border. Pomona—This serovar is associated with livestock and tends to produce severe kidney and liver disease. Grippotyphosa—In a survey of over 1,200 healthy dogs in Michigan, 24% tested as exposed to Leptospira,and the Grippotyphosa serovar was the most common. Icterohaemorrhagiae-This serovar is mostly associated with exposure to rats and rat urine in standing water. It tends to attack the liver. Leptospires live best in warm, slow-moving water, such as after heavy rains or flooding. After the water clears, they contaminate the soil for many months. Wildlife are common carriers of infection. A survey in Connecticut found 36% of raccoons had been exposed, while a survey in Illinois found 48% of raccoons had been. Another survey found 50% of rats had been exposed. Classically, infection of dogs and humans stems from the urine of infected animals getting into environmental water. Leptospirosis is a common human disease in tropical areas, especially where rice is farmed, and rats infest the paddies. Health authorities believe that rat populations are involved in the rising incidence of canine leptospirosis in urban areas, and leptospirosis is no longer considered a rural disease. Leptospires can survive for months in contaminated soil. This all sounds outdoorsy, but the 2021 leptospirosis outbreak in Los Angeles started in boarding facilities where dogs are commonly exposed to the urine of other dogs in play yards and kennel drainage pathways. Anywhere with potential urine contact is a potential home for Leptospira organisms. Canine Infection Dogs become infected by leptospires when irritated or cut skin comes into contact with infected urine or water contaminated with infected urine. Alternatively, bite wounds, exposure to reproductive secretions, and even eating infected tissues can transmit this infection. The organisms quickly spread through the bloodstream, leading first to inflaming the blood vessels: fever, abnormal bleeding, abnormal bruising, and tissue edema appear after an approximately seven-day incubation period. By two weeks post-infection, the leptospires have set up shop in the kidneys, where they continue to generate inflammation, pain, and potentially total kidney failure and the inability to produce urine. Some serovars also go to the liver and generate inflammation there, though the liver disease is generally not as severe as that of the kidney. A particularly devastating situation occurs if the organism gets into the lungs where the leptospire toxins produce what is termed “LeptospiraPulmonary Hemorrhage Syndrome." The lung bleeding that results is associated with a 70% mortality rate and bodes especially poorly. If the dog is able to keep the acute illness at bay, a chronic form may emerge. There can be more chronic kidney insufficiency and/or hepatitis. Furthermore, long-term immune stimulation can lead to a deep eye inflammation calleduveitisthat can cause the eyes to look cloudy or even change color. If the disease is treated in this form, it may not be possible to reverse the long-term damage that has already set in. The Different Clinical Pictures of Leptospirosis As you might gather, leptospirosis can look different: fever with bruising and bleeding; fever with different degrees of kidney failure; liver disease and kidney disease together; chronic hepatitis; and eye inflammation, etc. Another way to look at leptospirosis is to look at the time frame of the illness and how quickly or slowly it came on. Peracute Disease:Peracute disease means super-sudden onset. These are usually younger dogs with an overwhelming exposure. The large amount of leptospire toxin causes rapid death before the kidney or liver disease even happens. Acute Disease and Subacute Disease: This is more of the classic form described above—fever with bruising and bleeding, general muscle pain, and a painful belly from kidney and/or liver disease. There may be jaundice and inflammation in the eyes that makes them look cloudy. Chronic Disease:Recurring fevers, chronic hepatitis, chronic kidney disease, uveitis, poor appetite, weight loss. Younger dogs (less than one year of age) tend to get the most severe forms of leptospirosis. 87-100% of infected dogs will have some degree of azotemia, which means renal parameters will be elevated on routine blood testing. Excessive water consumption is frequently seen at home when this happens. Testing PCR Testing PCR testing is used to detect leptospire DNA. A blood sample is best in the first 10 days after infection, but after that, a urine sample is more likely to be positive. It may be prudent to submit both blood and urine samples. Past vaccination will not interfere with this test, although antibiotic exposure certainly will, and results can be back in a matter of days. PCR testing will not determine which serovar is present. MAT Testing (the Traditional Test) The Microscopic Agglutination Test, or MAT titer, is still considered the test of choice, though it has some disadvantages. It measures antibody levels against different leptospirosis serovars, with the idea that the one with the highest level is most likely the serovar causing the disease. Antibody levels are expressed as titers, which are ratios reflecting how much dilution is needed before it is too dilute to detect antibodies. For example, a titer of 1:32 means a serum diluted out 32 times still had detectable antibodies. A titer of 1:32 may sound pretty high but it is actually pretty low; an MAT titer must be at least 1:800 to be considered positive. If the serovar under consideration is one that might have been included in a past vaccination, the titer must be higher (1:3200) to be considered positive. To really obtain high confidence in the diagnosis of Leptospirosis, a second titer is submitted two to four weeks later, showing at least a four-fold increase in antibody production. Treatment with antibiotics should not interfere with the validity of the second (or "convalescent") titer level. There are two problems with this testing: In-House Test Kits and Other General Antibody ELISA Tests Recently in-house screening tests have become available so that a result can be obtained in 20 minutes or so. These tests screen for antibodies againstLeptospiraorganisms. They are either positive or negative. They will not tell you which serovar is involved nor how high the titer is. They will not distinguish antibodies from vaccination versus those from true infection. Clearly a positive test needs to be followed by another test. A negative test, however, is very helpful (see below). Other Tests In the past, cultures and darkfield microscopy were used to detect leptospires. This technology is now considered old-fashioned. Which Tests to Use? A good approach to begin with is a general antibody test combined with urine and blood PCR testing. If any PCR test detectsLeptospiraDNA either in blood or urine, infection is confirmed. A MAT test will determine which serovar is afoot and the antibody level can be tracked to be sure the treatment is working. If the PCR tests are negative (meaningLeptospiraDNA was not detected) but a general antibody test is positive, the MAT test will determine if the antibodies are related to prior vaccination or active infection. If PCR tests are negative (LeptospiraDNA not found) and no antibodies are found either, then it should be safe to cross leptospirosis off the list of possible diagnoses. Treatment Fortunately,Leptospira interrogans sensu latois sensitive todoxycycline, a readily available antibiotic. Leptospires are cleared from the blood within 24 hours of starting it, but it takes about a week for them to clear from the urine, so it is important to wear gloves, goggles, etc., and be conscious of contamination during urine cleanup. Infected animals should be isolated from other animals at least until their antibiotic course is complete and probably for a couple of weeks after. Check with your veterinarian for instructions. Intravenous fluids are crucial to support blood flow through the damaged kidneys so that recovery is possible. Any areas at home that have been contaminated with urine should be disinfected with an iodine-based product and you should wear gloves while cleaning any urine. Prognosis is guarded depending on the extent of organ damage; with appropriate treatment 80-90% survival rates are reported. This sounds wonderful, but it is important to keep in mind factors that can interfere with this rosy outcome. While most leptospirosis-related kidney injury responds to fluid therapy which can be given by most animal hospitals, more severe cases can require dialysis, which has limited availability. As mentioned, lung involvement has poor survivability. Infection with thePomonaserovar is associated with more severe disease. A good two weeks of doxycycline is generally needed. If this antibiotic is not tolerated,amoxicillinmay also work. Previously infected dogs may become re-infected. Past infection does not confer future immunity. Prevention Vaccination againstLeptospira interrogans sensu latois only available for the serovars called Canicola, Grippotyphosa,Pomona,andIcterohaemorragiae. (Some vaccines cover all four serovars, while others cover only two out of four.) As a result of the long-standing use of this vaccine, it is hard to assess how important it is to vaccinate against leptospirosis. As you might imagine, most recent outbreaks involve serovars for which vaccination does not exist, which suggests that the vaccine is working. Vaccination againstCanicolaandIcterohaemorragiaehas been traditional for dogs as it is included in the basic distemper shot (DHLPP - the “L” stands for leptospirosis). The American Animal Hospital Association vaccine guidelines consider vaccination against leptospirosis to be optional but recommend that if you are going to vaccinate for leptospirosis, use a vaccine covering all four serovars. In the past, the leptospirosis vaccine was thought to be associated with a higher chance of immunological vaccine reactions, but vaccines made from leptospires grown in protein-free media have made vaccination reactions less likely. Reactions considered to be normal to vaccination include fever, swelling at the injection site, and joint/muscle pain. These symptoms should resolve after a day or so. Small dogs are more likely to experience reactions. Consider pre-treatment with antihistamines prior to vaccination. Vaccination will reduce the severity of the disease but will not prevent infected dogs from becoming carriers. Other important aspects of prevention include controlling rodents in the pet's environment and removing standing water. The Infection in Humans The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors leptospirosis cases in people. Humans can be infected by direct contact with urine from an infected animal or food, soil, or water contaminated with urine from an infected animal. The most common species to transmit leptospirosis to humans are dogs, rats, raccoons, skunks, opossums, and other marsupials, cows, pigs, and mice. Recreational activities involving water and exposure to flood waters are also associated with human outbreaks. Other human risk factors include farm work, animal care work, camping, and sewer work. Remember, leptospires come from contaminated urine, which, in turn, contaminates environmental water and soil. The same symptoms occur in humans as would be seen in dogs.

Category: Lyme Disease in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English See the article summary below.  While the infection we know today as Lyme disease (named for the Connecticut town of Lyme) has been around for at least a century, public awareness and confusion did not occur until the late 1980s. Media exposure of this infection virtually exploded, leaving most of the general public with some basic knowledge and concern about this infection as it pertains to themselves as well as to their dogs. The canine experience of Lyme disease is very different from the human infection and we hope to sort out confusion here. Human Lyme Disease vs. Canine Lyme Disease After exposure to the Lyme organism, 90% of humans will ultimately develop symptoms but only about 5% of dogs will experience the disease. The first lesson to be learned about Lyme disease infection is that, as mentioned, it manifests completely differently in man’s best friend compared with the human experience. After being bitten by a tick that has transmittedBorrelia burgdorferi, 90% of humans will develop a rash and flu-like symptoms. In the next few weeks, for 60% of people, joint pain ensues with 15% of people developing actual neurologic abnormalities associated with Lyme disease and 5% of people developing a heart rhythm disturbance called “A-V block.” At this same point in the infection timeline, dogs have yet to develop any symptoms at all and 95% of infected dogs never will. In humans, Lyme disease presents with the potential for serious long-term illness while this is a possibility for only a small number of dogs. When canine illness does occur, it does not begin to manifest for weeks to months after infection at which point arthritis signs are noticed. Sometimes there is a fever. Most canine Lyme patients will respond rapidly to a simple course of proper antibiotics but there will be some unlucky dogs that develop an associated kidney disease so some related screening tests will be recommended for dogs testing positive. Heart and neurologic issues are exceedingly rare. TheBorrelia burgdorferiorganism is fairly well suited to live in the canine body without causing trouble. Most exposed dogs harbor the organism uneventfully. Still, it is important not to discount Lyme disease in dogs completely lest you overlook an easily eliminated cause of chronic joint disease, especially in dogs of the Northeast U.S. The infected dog’s most serious long-term potential regards glomerular disease. This is a type of kidney damage that occurs when the immune system is stimulated over a long time by a latent infectious organism or other immune stimuli in hiding. This is a much more insidious problem for which specific testing is needed (see below). The Tick and Its Control An organism that serves to transport and deliver an infectious organism from one host to another is called a vector. The vector of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States is the deer tick,Ixodes scapularis. The female tick lays a clump of approximately 2,000 eggs in the spring. A small six-legged larva hatches and attaches to a host as soon as it is able. Since the larva is small, it typically can only reach a small host, usually a white-footed mouse. If the mouse is carrying the Lyme disease spirochete, the baby tick will become infected when it drinks the mouse's blood. The tick won't get sick but it will carry the Lyme organism with it throughout its life. When the larva is full of blood, it will drop off the host and lie dormant until the following spring, about a year later. At this point, the larva molts and becomes a nymph. The nymph is a bit larger and may select another mouse as a host or may approach a larger game such as a dog or human. The nymph feeds for three to five days and when it is full it drops off and remains dormant until late summer. It then molts into an adult tick. When the nymph is feeding, it may infect its host with the Lyme spirochete. If the nymph was not already infected from its larval stage, it may become infected now during its spring feeding. The adult tick seeks a larger host, hence its name the deer tick; however, with man encroaching upon the range of the deer, there are often plenty of dogs or humans for the tick to attack. The adult ticks mate on their new host, feed, and transmit the Lyme spirochete if they are carrying it. The male tick remains attached through the winter but the female, once engorged with the host’s blood, drops off, hides under leaves and other debris through the winter, and in spring lays her eggs for the two-year cycle to begin again. This process of transmittingBorrelia burgdorferifrom the tick to the new mammal host requires a minimum of 48 hours, which means that if the tick is removed within 48 hours of attachment, the spirochete cannot be transmitted and the host will not get the disease. Tick control on the host is an effective means of preventing infection. There are numerous effective tick control products available in assorted formats including chewable treats, collars, and topical spot-on treatments. All of theseproductseither kill the tick or cause it to drop off before the 48-hour deadline. On the west coast ofthe United States, there is far less Lyme disease than in the east, although the northern coast of California is considered to have moderate risk. This is because the Lyme vector in these areas is primarilyIxodes pacificus, a tick whose nymphal and larval stages strongly prefer to feed on reptiles rather than mammals. Reptile blood has natural anti-Borreliafactors that kill the Lyme spirochete and prevent further transmission. There are several subspecies ofBorrelia burgdorferiin different parts of the world, so Lyme disease is not unique to the United States. Borrelia burgdorferi: The Spirochete and Its Detection The spirochete that causes Lyme disease cannot live outside the body of a host. It must live within either a mammal or a tick. In the mammal’s body, the spirochete is especially adept at binding to connective tissue. If you are doing additional reading on this organism, you will encounter references to the spirochete’s surface proteins called Osp (Osp stands for outer surface protein). Different Osps are expressed depending on whether the spirochete is attached to the tick midgut (OspA, OspB, and OspD) or the mammal’s connective tissue (OspC). By modifying its Osps, the spirochete can change its presentation to the mammalian host’s immune system thus escaping immune destruction. In addition to changing Osps, the spirochete can change its presentation to the mammalian host’s immune system, thus escaping immune destruction. In addition to changing Osps, the spirochete can change its shape into at least three different forms and can hide within cellular folds. The Lyme spirochete is a master of disguise and camouflage. This camouflage presents an enormous diagnostic challenge: if the actual host's immune system can't even find the organism, how are we supposed to detect it? Antibody Levels A dog with symptoms of Lyme disease ideally should have a test to confirm or rule out Lyme disease. Since it is almost impossible to culture the Lyme spirochete, efforts have centered on the detection of antibodies against the Osps. The problems encountered with this method are: The solution to some of these problems has come about in the form of the “C6 Antibody test.” This is an immunological test for antibodies against the “C6 peptide,” a very unique section of theBorrelia burgdorgerisurface antigens. It is only displayed by the organism after transmission into the mammal host's body. As the spirochete changes its configuration to escape the host's immune system, the C6 peptide remains constant and always detectable. The vaccine does not contain the C6 peptide so vaccinated dogs will not test positive. Dogs with other infections will not erroneously test positive. Furthermore, this test is simple enough to be available as an in-house test kit that can be run in most veterinary hospitals, with results in approximately 10 minutes. This still does not address distinguishing active infection from exposure. Dogs will test C6 positive within 3-5 weeks of infection. They stay positive for over a year. Putting together a clinical diagnosis based on the test results and symptoms of the pet remains in the realm of the veterinarian in charge. Testing Apparently Healthy Dogs The American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Consensus Statement on Lyme disease recommends testing any dog living in or recently visiting a Lyme endemic area for C6 antibodies. In areas where Lyme disease is common, this is typically done as part of the annual wellness visit along with heartworm testing.  The idea is to identify infected dogs and then screen them for urinary protein loss to catch the diagnosis of Lyme Nephritis early. Since dogs do not generally get sick from their LymeBorreliainfection, most experts do not recommend treating dogs for Lyme disease simply because they are positive for C6 antibodies but owners should be aware of the potential for Lyme disease symptoms in the future. Treatment and Its Goals Which of these dogs get sick and which do not? Does the dog with joint pain, fever, and a positive C6 test need medication? This is where the news is particularly good. Treatment of Lyme disease utilizes a two to four-week course ofdoxycyclineor its cousin minocycline.Oral amoxicillinor injectable cefovecin (Convenia®) can also be used as effective alternatives. If Lyme disease is a consideration, many veterinarians simply prescribe the medication. An obvious improvement is seen within 48 hours. Furthermore, most tick-borne infections capable of causing joint pain, fever, and signs similar to Lyme disease generally all respond to doxycycline so a simple course of medication covers several types of infection. Complete elimination of the Lyme spirochete is not a reasonable expectation with treatment; the organism is simply too good at hiding. The goal instead is to bring the patient into what is called a premunitive state, or when the immune system is in a protective mode. This is the state that 90% of infected dogs achieve when they get infected but never get ill: the organism is in their bodies latently but is not causing active infection or disease. Glomerular Disease (Lyme Nephritis) It is important to discuss a particularly serious complication ofBorrelia burgdorferiinfection: Lyme nephritis. While this occurs in a small portion of infected dogs, the consequences to the kidneys are frequently severe. While, as noted, a good 90 percent of dogs infected withBorrelia burgdorferinever get sick, some infected dogs are harmed by the long-time presence of an infectious organism in their bodies. The immune system is constantly active in its attempt to remove the invading spirochete, and over the years these complexes of antibodies may deposit in the kidney and cause damage that can be severe. This group of dogs will likely require medication for their kidney disease: antibiotics, treatments to reduce protein loss in urine, and potentially immune suppressive therapy.  It has been recommended that dogs with positiveBorrelia burgdorferiantibody levels be regularly screened for significant protein loss in their urine with a test called a “urine protein to creatinine ratio” so as not to miss these patients while their disease is still treatable. Vaccination:Lyme Disease Vaccination The object of vaccination is to prevent infection in dogs vaccinated before any exposure to Lyme spirochetes. A series of two vaccines is given with one dose 2-4 weeks apart followed by annual boosters. Some experts recommend a 6-month booster before going to the annual booster schedule. Dogs living or visiting Lyme areas will definitely need tick prevention and vaccination should be considered for additional protection. Virtually all the vaccines act by blocking OspA. Basically the tick drinks in the vaccinated host's blood full of anti-OspA antibodies. TheBorreliaorganism needs OspA to effectively move into the tick's mouth parts for transmission to the host but with the tick's belly full of OspA antibodies, OspA is blocked and the spirochete is quarantined inside the tick. Some vaccines also include OspC which is expressed. Several types of vaccines have been marketed and all of them are effective: Killed Whole BacterinThe killed whole spirochete vaccine uses intact dead spirochetes injected into the host. By using the entire spirochete, the host is exposed to parts of the organism that are not useful in immunization and has more potential to lead to vaccine reactions. Recombinant OspA VaccineThe next type of vaccine is felt to be superior in preventing reactions and that is the recombinant vaccine against OspA. This vaccine generates antibodies specifically against OspA, the surface protein the spirochete uses to attach to its tick host. When the tick bites and sucks blood full of Anti-OspA antibodies, the spirochete’s migration sequence is blocked and the spirochete is prevented from even exiting the tick. The vaccine utilizes DNA for OspA cloned into a harmless virus so that the entire Lyme spirochete is not used; only the OspA DNA is used. OspA and OspC VaccineThe third type of vaccine targets both OspA as above but also OspC. OspC is the surface protein theBorreliaorganism expresses inside the dog. The idea is that the OspC antibodies target Borrelia organisms that make it inside the dog's body, theoretically providing enhanced protection. Recombinant OspA plus Chimerized OspC VaccineThis vaccine has all the advantages of the OspA attack as well as the advantages of recombinant technology. Taking things a step further is the Chimerized OspC portion. The idea here is thatBorrelia burgdorferiexpresses OspC in the dog's body and generating antibodies against OspC enables the immune system to find the organism where ever it is hiding. The problem is that OspC is not one protein; there are many forms of OspC. The chimerized OspC used in the vaccine takes pieces from seven different versions of OspC and binds them into an amalgamation. In this way, the immune system can be directed against multiple versions of OspC rather than only one. Should Healthy Dogs Testing Positive Still Get Vaccinated? Prevention of Lyme disease in the dog is based on the following principles: Vaccination, Education, and Tick control. Hopefully, we have covered all of this in this article. This is a controversial subject and every veterinarian will have a perspective. Here are the pros and cons: Argument For Vaccination Argument Against Vaccination Dogs that are Lyme positive and sick (including having urinary protein loss) should not be vaccinated for Lyme disease. When it comes to prevention, there is nothing controversial about tick control. It is crucial in Lyme-endemic areas to use tick-controlling products. Lyme disease is a regional problem.

Category: Malassezia Dermatitis (Yeast Infection of Dog's Skin)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Yeasts are spore-like forms of fungi; malassezia dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease that results from the overgrowth of the natural malassezia yeast population on the skin. Why Suspect Yeast? Yeast infections are itchy, crusty, and smelly. Often a dog starts out with a rash or simple itching, but the skin thickens to an elephant skin appearance. The itch is extreme, and the odor can be especially troublesome. Parts of the body or the entire body can be affected. Mostly, dogs are affected, but cats can get yeast infections as well. Where Would a Dog Get a Yeast Infection? Yeast happily lives on most normal skin and in ears, claw folds, and anal glands. To get a yeast infection, conditions on the skin surface have to change to favor the proliferation of the yeasts. The yeasts in small normal numbers are harmless, but when the yeasts are in large numbers, disease results. It is also possible to actually become allergic to the proteins in the yeast cell wall (see below) so that very few yeast organisms are needed to incite very big inflammation. So, what conditions lead to yeast proliferation? An increase in skin oils (which often occurs in an allergic flare-up) would be the most common situation. Sometimes there is an immune deficiency that allows the yeast proliferation. Some animals are battling seborrhea (excessive oil production of the skin) and thus are naturally predisposed to yeast proliferation. Some animals are actually allergic to the yeasts themselves. The most important thing to realize is that while a yeast infection is not contagious, it tends to recur unless the underlying allergy, seborrhea, or other problem is controlled. The following breeds are predisposed genetically to yeast infections: the West Highland White Terrier, Basset hound, Cocker spaniel, Silky terrier, Australian terrier, Maltese, Chihuahua, Poodle, Shetland sheepdog, Lhasa apso, and the Dachshund. How is Yeast Infection/Overgrowth Confirmed? There are several testing methods to confirm the overgrowth of yeasts: Very few yeasts need to be seen under the microscope to confirm yeast infection. How to Get Rid of it? Treatment can be topical, oral, or both. Topical treatment is best used for localized spots of infection while oral medication would be better applied to larger infected areas. If the yeast infection is recurrent or if you wish to supplement oral medication, topical and oral treatment can be combined. Oral therapyKetoconazoleand its derivatives rule when it comes to oral therapy. Typically, a several-week treatment is needed, and there are numerous protocols involving different dosing schedules. Higher doses tend to be needed if recurrence is a problem. The extreme itch usually improves or resolves within one week. For animals that do not tolerate the azole class of medications,terbinafineis a good alternative choice. If oral medications are not effective, this suggests a biofilm has formed, and topical treatment must be added. ShampoosRecently a consensus statement was published by veterinary dermatologists regarding Malassezia dermatitis. When it came to shampoos, those favored contained 2% miconazole and 2% chlorhexidine. Shampoos were applied twice weekly with a 10-minute contact time before rinsing. This type of therapy was helpful in improving the effectiveness of the oral medication and was also a good choice for long-term maintenance therapy once the infection was controlled. There are many shampoo products available with these active ingredients, with vinegar bases, selenium, and/or topical ketoconazole. Your veterinarian may have a preferred product or regimen. Spot TreatmentsIf only a small area is involved, it is probably not necessary to bathe the entire animal. Acetic acid wipes can be used to cleanse the affected area. Mixtures of vinegar and water can be used, but the pet will develop a distinct vinegar odor. Treating the Underlying Cause It is important to realize that yeast overgrowth occurs in response to a primary problem, be it allergy, seborrhea, or something else. If the underlying problem is not controlled, yeast dermatitis is likely to recur periodically. It is common for allergic dogs to require some kind of periodic if not ongoing, anti-yeast therapy.

Category: MRSP Dogs and Spaying
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English This is an increasingly common question, as methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus pseudintermedius(MRSP – essentially the canine version of the high-profile human "superbug" MRSA) has expanded greatly in the canine population. As more dogs get MRSP infections and even more become inapparent carriers of this bug, more dogs that are carriers will need surgery (both elective and non-elective).  Since MRSP is now a leading cause of surgical site infections in dogs, there’s concern about what to do with these carriers, particularly when it comes to elective surgeries like spays and neuters. My answer to the question is… maybe. If the dog has an active MRSP infection (e.g. skin infection), I’d say "hold off for a while" if possible. I don’t like elective surgeries being done on animals with active infections (this applies to almost any kind of infection, not just MRSP). If an animal has an active MRSP infection, it might increase the risk of the surgical site becoming infected because of the greater overall burden of MRSP on the skin and elsewhere. If the dog doesn’t have an active infection (e.g. is a healthy carrier after having gotten over a previous MRSP infection), I’d say "go ahead." Here’s why: So, if infections are rare, despite the fact thatS. pseudintermediusis present on pretty much all dogs and that we don’t use drugs to killS. pseudintermediusduring (or after) spays, there should be no added risk of infection by the antibiotic-resistant version of this bug. Every dog is carrying lots of different bacteria that can cause an infection at any time. That’s why we use a variety of surgical antisepsis practices (e.g. clipping, scrubbing, sterile instruments, proper operating room) to help prevent a critical number of bacteria from getting into the sterile surgical site where they can start to cause problems. This strategy doesn’t necessarily apply to surgeries where antibiotics are used prophylactically (preventive) and where staph are the main causes of infection, especially in situations like orthopedic procedures where MRSP infections are common and can be very hard to treat. What to do in those cases with an MRSP-positive animal is a tougher question, and we’re working on an answer to it at the moment.

Category: Parvovirus Infection: Diagnosis
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A puppy with bloody diarrhea could have a parasite problem, a virus other than parvovirus, stress colitis, an intestinal foreign body, or may simply have eaten something that disagreed with him. It is important to confirm the diagnosis of parvovirus before embarking on what could be the wrong treatment. Tests that Are Especially Useful The Fecal Parvo ELISA Test The ELISA test has become the most common test for parvovirus in puppies. ELISA stands for Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay. This sounds complicated and high tech but is actually the same type of technology used in home pregnancy test kits. The parvo ELISA test is available as a kit and is performed in the vet’s office in about 15 minutes or less. There are many different brands and testing is sensitive in its ability to detect the actual virus in stool. If a puppy is shedding parvovirus in their stool, that would indicate an active infection. The test has some limitations that are important to realize. Recent vaccination with a live vaccine (the type of vaccine that is most effective) may interfere with the test results. This means that the test may detect the live virus from the vaccine and show a positive reading when, in fact, the puppy does not have a parvo infection. Classically, this interference occurs 5 to 12 days after vaccination so if a positive fecal ELISA test is obtained within this period after vaccination, additional tests may be recommended. A false negative result is possible. The puppy could be infected but no longer shedding the virus in its stool or only shedding the virus intermittently. Alternatively, the virus particles may be so thoroughly coated with antibodies that they cannot react with the test’s chemicals. Any test will have some potential for false negatives as well as false positives but if the puppy's clinical presentation fits and the ELISA test is positive, treatment for parvo infection should be pursued. In almost all cases, a negative ELISA reading can be trusted, but it is important to realize that no test is perfect. The Drop in White Cell Count Recall that one of the first actions of the canine parvovirus is to inhibit white blood cell division in the bone marrow. The virus essentially turns the immune system off before making its deadly way to the GI tract. This is a feature of parvovirus infection in all species, which means that a characteristic drop in white blood cell count is seen on a blood panel when the infection is active and real. If there is any question about the veracity of an ELISA test result, the presence or absence of a white cell count drop can be used to clarify the situation but it should be mentioned that the positive ELISA test often precedes the white cell drop by a couple of days. White blood cell count is commonly monitored through the treatment of infection. The white blood cell numbers bottom out during the brunt of infection and recovery of the white blood cell numbers heralds recovery. Tests that are Hard to Interpret and Rarely Used (but you Might Hear About them so We'll Explain them) PCR Testing Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is probably the newest method of testing for parvo. A fecal sample must be submitted to a reference laboratory for PCR testing; this is not the sort of test that can be done while you wait. The DNA of the parvovirus is recognized and amplified so as to be able to detect even small amounts of it. PCR testing is generally too sensitive to be clinically helpful yet canine parvovirus is commonly included on PCR panels that test for multiple intestinal virus organisms. The problem with PCR testing is that, because it amplifies DNA, very small amounts of virus can be detected which means that positive results will turn up on dogs that are vaccinated or who are passing insignificant amounts of virus. PCR testing is very helpful for many infections but often clouds the issue for parvovirus. Antibody Titers There are two types of antibody titers that can be run: IgG and IgM. With the advent of ELISA testing, titers are not frequently used in making this diagnosis anymore. The IgG titer is a more long-lasting antibody level. A high IgG titer would probably indicate an active infection in a puppy that is old enough to generate antibodies and who has not yet received any vaccinations. Most of the time, the IgG titer simply reflects antibodies generated by vaccination. The IgM titer reflects recent antibody production so if a vaccinated puppy had not been vaccinated recently, a high IgM titer might indicate active infection. Because parvovirus-infected puppies have frequently received vaccinations in the recent past and are frequently too young to generate their own antibodies (which is how vaccinated puppies get infected in the first place), these test results are difficult to interpret. It is easy to see why the ELISA test that directly detects the virus has become so popular. Titering is mostly used nowadays to determine if a dog has adequate protection against parvo, either through vaccination or prior exposure. In a shelter setting, a dog of unknown vaccination status can be tested to determine if he is considered protected from infection or not. In the pet setting, a dog can be tested to determine if a vaccine is needed or not. Certain antibody levels are associated with protection; however, because of other contributing branches of the immune system, an inadequate titer does not necessarily mean a dog is vulnerable. Biopsy Parvovirus lesions in the GI tract are of a classical appearance. There is no mistaking them under the microscope. Unfortunately, tissue samples of the GI tract are not readily available and most infected puppies are not good surgical candidates. Still, if a puppy has died and the cause is unclear, submitting samples of the GI tract can generally confirm or rule out a parvovirus diagnosis provided the tissue has not degenerated. It is also important to realize that puppies with parvovirus infection may have concurrent intestinal parasites or may have swallowed foreign bodies. There will be complicated conditions that must be monitored. This means that other tests will be required during the management of the parvo patient. The above tests are simply those that can be used to confirm the parvovirus diagnosis.

Category: Parvovirus: How it Happens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Whether or not infection happens depends on the interaction of three factors: host vitality (including immune experience/vaccination status); virulence of the virus (including virus strain and how many viral particles the host is exposed to); and environmental factors (other stresses and/or concurrent conditions). Obviously, these three aspects interplay somewhat (a stressful environment will reduce host vitality, a dry environment will reduce the number of viral particles, etc.) Where Does the Parvovirus Come From? Remember that this virus has been around since the 1970s, is hard to disinfect, and is shed in extremely large numbers by infected dogs. This means that there is a virus everywhere: on every carpet, on every floor, in every yard and park. The virus is shed in the stool for the first two weeks or less after the initial infection, but only a tiny portion of infected stool - which could be months old, depending on the environmental temperature and humidity - is needed to infect a non-immune dog. Some dogs become what is called subclinically infected, which means they do not appear particularly sick. These animals tend not to be confined since no one knows they are infected; thus, they can spread the virus around a large area depending on where they leave their droppings.  Basically, because the virus is hardy, it travels wherever dirt travels, and not a lot of virus is needed to create an infection in a susceptible dog. Why Only Puppies? The most important factors in whether parvovirus infection occurs seem to be the experience the dog’s immune system has had with the virus plus the number of viral particles the host is exposed to. In the 1970s and early 1980s, when the virus was new, all dogs, young and old, were susceptible, but now that the virus is everywhere, all dogs, even the unvaccinated ones, have at least some immunological experience with this virus. Any exposure, no matter how small, is likely to generate some antibodies. Also, vaccination is a widespread process nowadays, and it is likely that a dog has had at least one vaccine at some point. Will these antibodies be enough for protection? In general, the answer seems to be yes, depending on the dog's age at vaccination and the nature of the exposure; infection in dogs over age one year is rare.  It is important to realize, however, that this observation should not be taken to mean that adult dogs should not continue their vaccinations. Even though infection is unusual in adult dogs, adult dogs should still continue getting vaccinations as this is a life-threatening disease for which treatment is expensive, and no chances should be taken. Widespread vaccination is part of the reason why infection in adult dogs is rare. Natural Protection? The younger the dog, the less immunologic experience and the more susceptibility to infection there is. When puppies are born, they are completely unable to make antibodies against any infectious invader. They would be totally unprotected, except that nature has created a system to protect them. Their mother secretes a specific type of milk called colostrum for the first day or two after giving birth. It contains all the antibodies that the mother dog has circulating in her own body, and in this way, she gives her own immune experience to her offspring. These antibodies are protective until they wear off sometime in the first four months of the puppy's life. How much colostrum an individual puppy gets depends on its birth order and how strong it nurses; not all puppies get the same amount of antibodies. Every nine days, the antibody levels possessed by the puppies drop by half. When the antibody level drops to a certain level, they no longer have enough antibodies to protect them, and if they are exposed to a large enough number of viral particles, they will get infected. The age at which maternal antibodies disappear is different for each individual puppy and is not predictable. We recommend that puppies be restricted from public outdoor areas until their vaccination series is completed at age 16 weeks. There is a period of a week or so during which the puppy has no antibody protection left over from its mother but still is not yet competent to respond to vaccination. This window is where even the most well-cared-for puppies get infected. Incubation The virus enters the body through the mouth as the puppy cleans itself or eats food off the ground or floor. A minuscule amount of infected stool is all it takes. There is a three- to seven-day incubation period before the puppy seems obviously ill. Upon entering the body, the virus seeks out the nearest rapidly dividing group of cells. The lymph nodes in the throat fit the bill, and the virus sets up here first and replicates to large numbers. After a couple of days, so much virus has been produced that significant amounts of it have been released into the bloodstream. Over the next three to four days, the virus seeks new organs containing the rapidly dividing cells it needs: the bone marrow and the delicate intestinal cells. Within the bone marrow, the virus is responsible for the destruction of young cells of the immune system. By killing these cells, it knocks out the body's best defense and ensures itself a reign of terror in the GI tract, where its most devastating effects occur. Parvoviral infections are characterized by a drop in white blood cell count due to bone marrow infection. Seeing this on a blood test may help clinch the diagnosis of parvoviral infection. Also, a veterinarian may choose to monitor white blood cell count to track the progress of the infection with the recovery of the white cell count correlating with the defeat of the infection. The white cell count, which in a normal dog is measured in the tens of thousands, may drop to nearly zero in the brunt of the disease. The GI tract is where the heaviest damage occurs. The normal intestine possesses little finger-like protrusions called villi. Having these tiny fingers greatly increases the surface area available for the absorption of fluid and nutrients. To make the surface area available for absorption greater still, the villi possess microvilli, which are microscopic protrusions. The cells of the villi are relatively short-lived and are readily replaced by new cells. The source of the new cells is the rapidly dividing area at the foot of the villi called the crypts of Lieberkuhn. Parvovirus strikes right at the crypt. Without new cells coming from the crypt, the villus becomes blunted and unable to absorb nutrients. Diarrhea in large quantities results, not to mention nausea. The barrier separating the digestive bacteria from the bloodstream breaks down. Diarrhea becomes bloody and bacteria can enter the body, causing widespread infection (remember that that virus has also simultaneously destroyed the bone marrow's ability to respond immunologically). The virus kills dogs in one of two ways: How is Survival Possible? Even parvovirus cannot disrupt the entire immune system. Plus, every day that goes by allows more antibodies to be produced. This antibody can bind and inactivate the virus. Whether survival is possible amounts to a race between the damaged immune system trying to recover and respond versus the fluid loss and bacterial invasion. Hospitalization with IV fluids and intensive supportive care greatly increases but doesn't guarantee the chance of survival.

Category: Parvovirus: Vaccination and Prevention
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It should not be too surprising that the biggest step in preventing parvovirus is vaccination. As discussed in other sections, the virus exists virtually everywhere. It is hardy in the environment and easily carried on the surfaces of inanimate objects. Every dog will be exposed and every puppy will be vulnerable at least for a time. Prevention is about minimizing exposure to the virus until the vaccination series is completed. We will be discussing how to go about achieving immunity for your puppy. Maternal Antibody: Our Biggest Obstacle in Vaccination The biggest obstacle in protecting a puppy against this infection ironically stems from its own natural mechanism of protection. As mentioned, puppies obtain their immunity from their mother’s first milk, the colostrum, on the first day of life. This special milk contains the mother’s antibodies against all the infections she has experienced or been immunized against, parvovirus included, and until these antibodies wane to ineffective levels, they will protect the puppy. The problem is that they will also inactivate the vaccine. The vaccine is a solution containing a harmless version of the virus, either live and weakened (attenuated or modified live virus vaccine) or killed (inactivated virus vaccine). This virus is injected into the puppy. If there is still adequate maternal antibody present, the vaccine virus will be destroyed just as if it were a real infection. There will be about a week when there is not enough maternal antibody to protect the puppy but too much to allow a vaccine to work. (This period is called the window of vulnerability.)  After this period, a vaccine can be effective. To get around this, we vaccinate puppies in a series, giving a vaccine every 2 to 4 weeks until age 16 weeks. By giving the vaccine at intervals, we are trying to catch the puppy's immune system after their window of vulnerability has closed. We know that by age 16 weeks, puppies should have protection (immune response, immunization), but we still begin at a younger age to provide immunization as soon as possible. If the mother has been well-vaccinated (booster vaccine given at approximately the time of breeding to maximize her colostral antibodies), an additional vaccine at 20 weeks may be a good idea to be sure all the maternal antibodies have waned adequately. This will be also based on the puppy's risk factors for parvovirus (how likely it is for your puppy to be infected) and your veterinarian's recommendations. After a puppy is born, maternal antibody levels drop by half approximately every 10 days.Puppies that were born first or were more aggressive at nursing on the first day will get more maternal antibodies than their littermates. Mother dogs vaccinated at approximately the time of breeding will have the highest antibody levels to pass on to their puppies. Remember, the more maternal antibody a puppy has, the less likely a vaccine is to work, and the longer one must wait for antibodies to wane and for vaccination to be effective. Should Live or Killed Vaccine Be Used? The killed vaccine is the least effective at penetrating maternal antibodies. It is also associated with more vaccine reactions since more stabilizing chemicals are used in a killed vaccine. As a general rule, a live parvovirus vaccine is absolutely the way to go. What is a High Titer Vaccine? In the mid-1990s, a new innovation in parvo vaccination was developed: the high titer vaccine. The term high titer refers to the amount of virus in the dose of vaccine and means that there is a great deal more virus than in the vaccines that were standard at the time. Nowadays, any vaccine against parvovirus is going to be high titer. When the puppy is vaccinated, the maternal antibody binds to the virus present. When a high titer vaccine is used, there is still a virus left over after all the maternal antibodies have been used up. This extra virus can then stimulate the puppy’s own immune system. High titer vaccines commonly produce full protection by age 12 weeks (though most experts recommend carrying vaccination out to age 16 weeks to be certain - an excellent idea for predisposed breeds such as the Rottweiler, Doberman pinscher, and American pit bull terrier). At this point, virtually all commercially available live vaccines are of the high titer type. It should be noted that giving vaccines more frequently than every two weeks will cause interference between the two vaccines, and neither can be expected to be as effective as they normally would.This includes giving vaccines for different infections. Vaccines should be spaced 2 to 4 weeks apart. It is commonly held that puppies need a certain number of vaccines for protection to be achieved (usually, either three or four is the magic number). The number of vaccines given has nothing to do with protection. For protection to be achieved, a vaccine must be given when it can penetrate maternal antibodies. Avaccine FAQcan answer common vaccination questions. Vaccinating Adult Dogs Traditionally, the parvovirus vaccine has been administered annually to all dogs. Vaccine against canine parvovirus has been included in the distemper combination vaccine (the DHLPP, “6 in one,” etc.) There has also been some thought that annual vaccination is not necessary, especially for a disease where adult dogs are considered low risk. Many university teaching hospitals have switched to a 3-year schedule for adult dogs, plus the American Animal Hospital Association recommends that parvo vaccination be given to adult dogs on a 3-year schedule. There is still controversy regarding this practice and many hospitals continue to use the annual guideline as that is usually as far as formal vaccine challenge testing has gone. Do not be surprised if your veterinarian has chosen to follow the university and begins recommending a 3-year vaccination protocol for this virus. Read theAAHA vaccination guidelines. What is the Meaning of a Vaccine Titer? A vaccine titer is a blood test that measures the antibody level a dog is carrying against a certain virus. There are two methods of measuring parvovirus antibody titer: hemagglutination inhibition and serum neutralization. The result obtained, expressed as a ratio, refers to how diluted the dog’s serum (blood) must be for the antibody to still be detectable. Based on work at Cornell University, the following titer levels are generally considered protective: The Virus Neutralization titer is felt to be the most accurate representation of protection, so if you choose to use a titer test to determine if your dog needs a vaccine, be sure you know which type of titer you are getting. There is a great deal of controversy regarding whether or not a certain level of antibody can be considered tantamount to protection. Many veterinarians do not feel it is useful to run titers until this issue is resolved (i.e., there is more to protection than an antibody level; there is an entire immune system involved, and there is no simple way to assess the entire immune system). Other veterinarians find it cost-ineffective to recommend titers prior to vaccination; it costs a great deal more to run the titer than to simply give the vaccination. If the titer is adequate, the worst possible outcome is that the vaccine will be ineffective. Other veterinarians question whether or not it is harmless to annually give vaccinations when there is already adequate immunity. At this time, there is no single answer to this issue, and we recommend trusting your veterinarian’s educated opinions regarding these issues. Protection After Infection A puppy that has recovered from a parvovirus infection can be expected to have strong immunity. This has been tested out to 20 months after infection, and immunity is believed to be lifelong; because this is unproven, continued vaccination is commonly recommended. Prevention by Environmental Control Because of parvovirus, puppies should not be allowed out in the public world until their vaccine series has been completed. This means not going for walks or to the park and not socializing with other puppies. There is some controversy regarding the socialization of young puppies if they are kept isolated in this way until age 16 weeks; however, from an infectious disease standpoint, this is the safest way to go. If the home has previously housed a parvo-infected dog or puppy,disinfection(especially removing fecal matter) is paramount. By getting an older puppy whose vaccination series is already complete, you can avoid this entire issue.

Category: Positive Snap Tests for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are bacterial diseases dogs get that are spread by tick bites. The disease can be a little different depending on the individual bacterial species, but treatment is generally the same. Certain species of ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis can be infectious to humans as well, generally through a tick bite. Bacterial species that cause ehrlichiosis areEhrlichia ewingii, Ehrlichia chaffeensis,andEhrlichia canis. Species that cause anaplasmosis areAnaplasma phagocytophilumandAnaplasma platys. Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis look similar when your veterinarian gives a physical examination. Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is common, which may lead to bruising or abnormal bleeding. Ehrlichiosis and certain species ofAnaplasmacan also cause a low red blood cell count, what we call anemia, which can appear as pale skin and gums or cause a pet to act tired. Swollen or painful joints may also be seen with ehrlichiosis and some anaplasmosis infections. All of these symptoms can occur suddenly, or they may happen off and on over time. Because these diseases are caused by ticks and can lead to pretty serious illnesses in dogs and people, testing methods were created to quickly screen for these organisms in pets. The most common test is an IDEXX Snap® test, which can be performed in minutes by veterinarians in general practice clinics or hospitals. Snap tests use a small blood sample to determine if the pet has created antibodies againstAnaplasmaspp. andEhrlichiaspp.  Antibodies are proteins in the blood that are created when a pet's body is exposed to bacteria and viruses so as to help fight that infection. Each antibody is made specifically for the virus or bacteria the body was exposed to. Even after the infection is gone, these antibodies will remain in the blood stream. This is partly why people and pets become immune to certain illnesses after they get sick. Unfortunately, Snap tests are not 100% accurate and results can be a bit confusing. Tests can sometimes be negative even if the pet has the infection. This could be because the pet was only recently infected and hasn’t had time to build up enough antibodies to make the test positive. Sometimes Snap tests are positive when a pet is not infected. This is usually because the pet was exposed to the bacteria from a tick bite. Even though the pet didn’t develop an infection, their body made enough antibodies to protect itself just in case. Remember that positive Snap tests only mean that antibodies to ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis are in the bloodstream. The tests can’t tell whether the bacteria themselves are in the pet’s body. Snap tests can also be positive if a pet is a carrier of infection, meaning they are infected but not showing any symptoms. Many carriers never show signs of infection. It is not fully clear why this happens, which can be confusing and worrisome for many pet owners. A history of tick bites, symptoms, and abnormal findings on a physical exam need to be taken into account to determine if the pet is truly infected or not. Blood tests to check the platelet and red blood cell count can be done to see if the pet is experiencing active infection (as opposed to being a carrier of infection). Additional testing can be sent out if a true diagnosis is needed. These types of tests can also determine which specific type of anaplasmosis or ehrlichiosis infections the pet has. A pet with a normal checkup who shows no symptoms but has a positive Snap test can be monitored. This means you will need to keep an eye open for new symptoms and physical changes, but you don't need to do anything else. In some cases, if the pet’s tests and symptoms are suspicious for an active infection your veterinarian may prescribe a course of antibiotics. Your veterinarian will help you decide whether additional testing is necessary.

Category: Rabies in Animals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   Click here for a summary. Descriptions of rabies go back thousands of years as rabies has classically been one of the most feared infections of all time. It is because of this fear that dog ownership requires a license and documentation of rabies vaccination. There is still no reliably effective treatment for rabies infection once symptoms have started. The virus does not survive outside of the infected host very long, so direct contact with fresh secretions is required for transmission.  In most cases, the disease is transmitted via a bite wound and it is mostly wildlife that gets infected. When wildlife starts coming into contact with the pet population, then pets become infected and when pets get infected, human infection is not far behind. Because this infection has nearly 100% mortality, preventing it in pets becomes crucial to preventing it in people. Of course, people can get infected by wildlife contact as well. Despite vaccination being readily available, every year the U.S. reports approximately 50 canine deaths, 250 feline deaths, and several human deaths from rabies. Worldwide, some 55,000 human deaths occur annually from rabies even now in the 21st century. The most common wildlife species to spread rabies to domestic animals and humans in the Northern Hemisphere are skunks, bats, raccoons, foxes, and coyotes. Wildlife (especially bats) can gain access to indoor areas where they can come in close contact with both pets and people. Indoor pets are not without risk. Many people do not realize how fast death occurs from rabies. While it may take a long time for the virus to incubate, once even mild symptoms begin, death occurs within 10 days. The injection treatment most people have heard of only works during the incubation period;once symptoms have started, survival chances are slim. The Course of the Disease The virus in the infected animal's saliva enters the victim's tissues during the bite. The virus attaches to the local muscle cells for a couple of days before penetrating local nerves and beginning its slow ascent to the brain. Once within nervous tissue, the virus is not accessible to the immune system and may safely proceed toward the brain. The journey is slow and can take up to a year but the average time is three to eight weeks depending on the species. Virus ultimately reaches the brain and in two to three days more is evident in all body secretions, including saliva. At this point, the disease becomes transmissible and symptoms begin. It can take up to a year from the time of the initial bite before symptoms begin to show.In dogs, typical incubation periods are 21-80 days.In cats, it's 28-42 days.Once symptoms show, treatment is nearly impossible. Prodromal Stage (The First 2-3 Days After Symptoms Have Started)A personality change is noted. Friendly animals become shy, etc. The larynx begins to spasm and a voice change may be noted (especially true in rabid cattle). Most infected animals will actively lick or scratch the site of the original bite. Excitative Stage (Next 1-7 Days) Classically, this would be the "mad dog" stage, though, in reality, most animals skip this phase altogether. The animal has no fear and suffers from hallucinations. If confined, the animal often attacks the bars of the cage. Paralytic or Dumb Stage (Next 2-4 Days) Weakness/paralysis sets in. The larynx is paralyzed, resulting in an inability to swallow, thus drooling and "foaming at the mouth" result. The animal dies when the intercostal muscles that control breathing are paralyzed. It is from animals in this stage where most human exposure occurs. There is no treatment for animals or humans once clinical signs appear. Once the virus has been released to body secretions, it is again accessible to the immune system; however, the patient dies before an adequate immune response is mounted. The classical symptoms of rabies described above may not be recognizable, making diagnosis difficult if not impossible in a living animal. Long quarantines are often needed to determine if the infection has occurred. When human exposure to the animal in question is involved, what happens depends on several criteria. If the animal in question is dead, its brain can be tested for rabies. There is no test for rabies in a living animal but since we know that death follows quickly after the virus becomes contagious, a living animal can be confined for 10 days. If the animal is still alive 10 days after biting a person, then the bite could not have transmitted rabies.  Prevention For Our Pets Happily, rabies prevention is accomplished with vaccination and limiting exposure to wildlife. The standard killed virus vaccines are available for both dogs and cats and, after the initial dose which is good for one year, subsequent doses are generally good for three years. Because tumors have developed in cats who received the killed virus vaccine, a recombinant product is now available that uses a portion of rabies viral DNA cloned into a harmless canarypox virus. This arrangement allows the pet to realize the benefits of live virus vaccination without any risk of exposure to the living rabies virus. Rabies vaccination protocols are typically controlled by municipal regulations. Most communities legally require the vaccination of all dogs. TheAmerican Association of Feline Practitionersrecommends rabies vaccination as a core vaccine for all pet cats. For pets not current on rabies vaccination that have been exposed to biting wildlife, the Texas Post-Exposure Rabies Prophylaxis Protocol has been particularly helpful. In this situation, the pet should be vaccinated for rabies as soon as possible after the wildlife bite with booster vaccines given three weeks post-bite and eight weeks post-bite. The pet should be strictly isolated for 90 days. This protocol has been extremely successful in preventing rabies symptoms and contagion when normal rabies vaccination had lapsed. Treatment for Humans (Post Exposure Prophylaxis or PEP) As mentioned, once symptoms have started, treatment can be attempted but truly there is little chance of survival. The only way to survive rabies is to exploit the long incubation period and basically get vaccinated quickly. Doing this involves a very big piece of information: knowing you were (or may have been) exposed. Every year a small number of people die of rabies in the U.S. Most of these people were bitten by a dog, bat, or some other animal and did nothing other than basic first aid. Recall that it takes many weeks for the rabies virus to reach the brain. This allows time for the vaccine to be given so that when the virus "comes out" of its neurologic hiding place and is ready to infect the brain, a substantial immunologic response is waiting. The virus is foiled and clinical rabies does not result. If you are bitten by an animal and its rabies vaccination history is unknown, there are definite steps to take. A fresh bite wound should be washed out with water quickly as this may wash out viral particles. The time it takes for the virus to reach the brain depends on the amount of virus and how close the wound is to the head. This simple step can be life-saving. If the biting animal is alive, its vaccination status should be confirmed as soon as possible and it will need to be confined according to local law. The bite wound should be reported to the health department as soon as possible. Only rodent and rabbit bites are not reportable. If the animal is dead then its brain can be tested for rabies. The head of the biting animal is submitted to the health department for fluorescent antibody testing for the rabies virus. This process takes a matter of hours so that any bite victims can know right away if they will require rabies treatment. If the animal is not available or its vaccination status is in question, further treatment may be needed. Hyperimmune (antibody-rich) serum is flushed into the wound in the hope of inactivating the virus before it penetrates the nerves. The patient receives a vaccination on a regular schedule for about a month, as described above. Veterinarians have a rabies exposure risk of more than 300 times that of the general population. Anyone pursuing a career with animals should consider vaccination against rabies. The Law Regarding Animal Bites (Against Humans) In the U.S., states and counties have different regulations regarding rabies vaccines for companion animals and bites to humans. Regulations for your area in the U.S. can be found through your county's health department. In almost all states in the U.S., the biting animal must be confinedfor observationfor 10 days at the owner's expense regardless of vaccination status. The purpose of the quarantine period is to determine if the rabies virus could have been in the animal's saliva at the time of the bite. An animal infected with rabies and shedding virus will certainly be dead within ten days. If the biting animal is known to have been exposed to wildlife, the situation is different. A vaccinated animal must be re-vaccinated within the time period required by local regulations and confined for observation for the specified duration. Unvaccinated animals may be confined for a specified time period according to local/regional law, or be euthanized and tested for rabies. In the U.S., all bites to humans that break the skin are reportable to local health departments. Rabies vaccination requirements vary from state to state, and country to country.  Contact your veterinarian if you think your pet has come into contact with or been bitten by a wild animal. Regardless of the vaccination status of your pet, wild animal bites may lead to painful wounds and infection. Again, laws regarding biting dogs and rabies vaccination are highly regional.Check with your local animal regulation department, your veterinarian, or visitrabiesaware.orgto find out what you need to know in the U.S.. Quarantines when Traveling Great Britain, Hawaii, Japan, New Zealand, and several other island areas have successfully eradicated rabies from their territory. These places are EXTREMELY cautious about allowing in potential carriers of rabies. Because of the long incubation period of rabies, a very long quarantine is needed; however, this must be balanced by the expense associated with quarantine and owners' reluctance to be separated from their pets. Most places that have eradicated rabies have protocols for avoiding or minimizing quarantine. Typically, a microchip is implanted in the pet for identification purposes, a rabies antibody titer (a measurement of vaccine-induced protection) must be performed at an approved laboratory, and rabies vaccine documentation is necessary. For listings of what each state requires for entry, go to theUSDA. Fortravel to another countrycheck with that country's consulate, but guidelines are also available at USDA. Other Links TheCDC's rabies home pagehas, in addition to basic information, a children's education area that is particularly helpful for families who go camping. The annualWorld Rabies Daycalls attention to this problem to raise awareness and provides information about rabies in both humans and animals.  In Summary: You can’t treat rabies once symptoms set in; all you can do is prevent it. Rabies is a virus transmitted through saliva or brain tissue. Without rapid preventive treatment, it is almostalwaysfatal. That’s why your pets are required to have rabies vaccines in many areas of the world. The most common wildlife species to spread rabies to animals and people in the Northern Hemisphere are bats, skunks, raccoons, foxes, and coyotes. It is generally caused by a bite wound, and mostly wildlife gets infected. Rabies affects a mammal’s central nervous system. It can take up to a year before symptoms begin to show, but the average time is 3-8 weeks depending on the species. In dogs, the typical incubation period is 21-80 days. In cats, it's 28-42 days.Once symptoms begin, treatment is nearly impossible. If you are bitten, you need a preventive injection immediately as it only works during the incubation period. Once even mild symptoms begin, death occurs within 10 days.  After symptoms have started:  Symptoms may not be obviously recognizable, making diagnosis difficult if not impossible. There is no diagnostic test for rabies in a living animal. What happens after people are exposed depends on the situation. If the animal is dead, its head is sent to a laboratory so the brain tissue can be tested. In some circumstances/locations, a living animal can be quarantined for 10 days at the owner’s expense; if the animal is still alive, then the bite could not have transmitted rabies. The vaccine protocols are typically controlled by municipal regulations. Most communities legally require all dogs to be vaccinated and recommend it for cats. Vaccination requirements vary from state to state, and country to country. Exposed pets not current on rabies vaccination should be given booster vaccines at 3 and 8 weeks post-bite. The pet should be strictly isolated for 90 days. Exposed humans should wash the bite with water as it may wash out some virus particles; the time it takes for the virus to reach the brain depends on the amount of virus in addition to how close the wound is to the head.  This step could save a life. Animal bites need to be reported to local health departments. Veterinarians have a rabies exposure risk of more than 300 times that of the general population. Anyone in an animal-oriented job should consider preventive vaccination.Back to top The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Resource Guarding in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is resource guarding and why does it occur? Resource guarding is a relatively common behavior problem in dogs. It is defined as a dog using avoidance, threatening, or aggressive behaviors to retain control of food or other items in front of a person or other animal. Sometimes, the signs of resource guarding are subtle. In these cases, your dog may show avoidance behavior or mild signs of aggression and anxiety such as stiff or crouched body posture, pinned back ears, lip licking, and physically blocking access to the resource. The aggression may escalate to more severe and overt signs of aggression such as growling, snapping, or biting. Food and food-related items are the most common resources that are guarded by dogs. However, any resource that is valuable to the dog may be guarded. This includes but is not limited to toys, beds, furniture, bones, resting areas, and even certain people. Resource guarding may have a genetic component and occurs in males or females of any breed. This issue can develop at any age. Resource guarding may be an issue that appears and progresses over time, or it may begin suddenly after a change in environment or routine. Resource guarding does not have anything to do with dominance. It is a common misconception that dogs show aggression or develop behavior problems because they do not understand their “place in the pack.” This misconception is problematic because it often leads to training using force and punishment to show the dog who is “top dog.” However,dominancein this sense has been scientifically debunked. Using force and punishment in a situation like resource guarding often makes the behavior problem worse and can cause your animal to fear you and damage your relationship. To successfully manage resource guarding, we must change the underlying motivation and emotion behind the behavior (anxiety, fear, frustration). Studies have shown that reward-based methods are more effective and humane when managing behavior problems such as resource guarding. To a degree, resource guarding can be considered a normal canine behavior since obtaining resources is necessary for survival. However, just because it can be considered normal does not make it desirable, safe, or acceptable in a household. Unfortunately, over time, dogs may learn that their aggressive responses are effective at protecting their resources, so the behavior will persist or even worsen. Additionally, if a dog’s mild signs of aggression are ignored or punished, this can cause their behaviors to escalate to more severe forms of aggression. For example, a dog may initially show mild signs such as freezing or hunching over their resource with a stiff body posture. If this behavior is punished or ignored the dog will likely realize subtle signs are not effective. In this situation, dogs are likely to escalate to more overt forms of aggression, such as growling, snapping, or biting. Then it becomes more challenging to manage and treat the issue. How can my veterinarian help with Resource Guarding? Your veterinarian may be able to help you with this problem themselves, or they may refer you to a veterinary behaviorist. If you are experiencing this problem with your pet, it is important that you discuss it with your veterinarian. Resource guarding may be caused by an underlying medical issue, especially if the behavior starts suddenly in an adult dog. Your veterinarian will complete a thorough physical exam and may request further testing based on their findings to determine if there is a medical issue. Sometimes medications can be helpful in the treatment of resource guarding especially if anxiety is a cause for the behavior.   Treatment and Management: What to do: Treatment and Management: What NOT to do: Prevention and Avoidance The treatment of resource guarding needs to be highly individualized for each dog and household. These dogs often need a combination of behavioral modification, training, and environmental and management changes.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Ringworm Environmental Decontamination: How to Clean Your Home When Your Pet Has Ringworm Dermatophytosis, commonly calledringworm, is a fungal infection of the fur and skin of dogs and cats. When your pet has ringworm, it is really important to clean and disinfect your home to prevent the spread of ringworm to other pets and to people. How to Clean and Disinfect the Home Thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the home when a pet has ringworm is called environmental decontamination and is a two-step process.STEP 1: Remove pet hairWipe, sweep, and/or vacuum the surface then thoroughly wash the surface until visibly clean of pet hair. Remove any excess water before Step 2.STEP 2: Disinfect the surface.Apply disinfectant and let sit for 5 min.Step 1 is the most important step because many surfaces can be rid of ringworm by removing pet hair. Additionally, many disinfectants do not work in the presence of debris. Below is a guide to cleaning and disinfecting various materials.

Category: Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is caused byRickettsia rickettsii. This intracellular parasite is transmitted to dogs through the bite of an infected tick. The ticks that can transmit RMSF are the Rocky Mountain wood tick, the American dog tick, and the brown dog tick. In the United States, RMSF is most common in the southern Atlantic states, western central states, and areas of the mid-Atlantic and southern New England coastal states. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only about 1 to 3 percent of the tick population carriesR. rickettsii, even in those geographic areas. Prior research indicated that the infected tick must be attached for at least 2 hours in order to transmit disease. Research in Brazil demonstrated that unfed ticks had to be attached for more than 10 hours for transmission to occur, whereas fed ticks could transmit disease within as little as 10 minutes after attachment. These results may indicate that transmission across all tick species could occur earlier than once thought, depending on when the tick has last eaten. Transmission of the Rickettsia can then occur due to the bite or from exposure to the parasite while handling the tick. Clinical Signs Clinical signs will show up 2 to 14 days after the bite occurred. The parasite creates an inflammation of the body's small blood vessels, which results in damage to all the organs of the body. Common signs include fever, lethargy, inappetence, pain, eye/nose discharge, nosebleed, cough, enlarged lymph nodes, lameness, skin necrosis/sloughing, hemorrhage, and peripheral swelling. Petechial hemorrhages (tiny hemorrhages in the skin) will occur in about 20% of affected dogs. Up to one third of the infected dogs will have central nervous system signs (lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements, weakness, balance problems, cranial nerve abnormalities, seizures, stupor, spinal pain, etc.). Any organ in the body may be affected and the clinical signs may be mild or severe enough to result in death. Diagnosis Diagnostic tests for RMSF include blood tests looking for severely low platelet count, plus coagulation profiles, blood chemical analysis, and serology. (Paired titers, from blood samples taken 14 to 21 days apart, are often needed, but a single high titer in dogs that have clinical signs is consistent with an active infection.)  Response to antibiotic therapy is suggestive, but not diagnostic. Treatment/Management Specific treatment relies on the use of appropriate antibiotics. Response to the antibiotics usually is seen within 24 to 48 hours, although advanced cases may not respond at all to treatment. The most common antibiotics used are tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. Chloramphenicol is usually reserved for pregnant bitches or young puppies. Fluoroquinolones, such as enrofloxacin, have shown efficacy, but their use is generally restricted to older animals. Side effects to any of the antibiotics may be seen. Your veterinarian will choose the antibiotic that best suits your pet's age, pregnancy status, etc. Blood transfusions to treat anemia and other supportive therapies may be needed. Prognosis Prognosis is excellent in dogs that are diagnosed and treated early and who have no complications. Lifelong immunity often occurs after the infection is cleared.More severely affected patients are at higher risk for complications, such as kidney disease, neurological disease, vasculitis, and coagulopathies. Prognosis is guarded for patients that have complications. PreventionLimit your dog's exposure to ticks and tick-infested areas. Inspect your dog closely for ticks. The sooner you can remove a tick after it attaches, the better the chance that the organism will not have had time to become infective. Wear gloves when removing ticks, as the infective organism can get into your body through abrasions, cuts, etc. You can also use a tick remover tool. Usetick control productsto prevent ticks from attaching or to kill ones that are already attached.

Category: Sanitizing and Disinfecting the Environment after Parvovirus in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Canine parvovirus is a highly contagious virus. Young, old, unvaccinated, or immune-compromised dogs are particularly susceptible. Parvo, as it is typically called, or CPV, lives well in the environment, both indoors and outside. It is a non-enveloped virus, which means it lacks a membrane often called the envelope that is stronger than enveloped ones. It can survive indoors for months and outdoors it can live for months to years, especially in dark, moist environments. Parvo can be easily spread by fomites, which are objects such as a doorknob or pet fur that can be contaminated by a virus. Dog-to-dog contact is not required for susceptible dogs to become infected. Dogs can become infected from contact with the remaining virus where an infected dog has been, or on objects an infected dog has used, or even from shoes and clothing carrying the virus. To make matters worse, non-enveloped viruses are not easily killed by most common household disinfectants and antibacterial soaps do not kill it. If you have had a dog with canine parvovirus in your home or yard, you need accurate information about what you can do to decrease or eliminate the risk of exposing other dogs while understanding that you cannot completely eliminate parvovirus from your home; it's simply not possible. First, Remove Organic Material Sanitizing is a two-step process that involves both cleaning and disinfecting. Some surfaces and substrates are easier than others to sanitize. For instance, carpet and grass are difficult to properly sanitize, whereas sealed cement is easier. Before disinfecting, you need to clean since many disinfectants do not work well on organic material, such as stool or urine. Clean up any organic material from the yard and in the house. Bedding and toys that are not heavily soiled can be washed through a soap/bleach cycle and dried on a hot setting. It is best to discard anything heavily soiled. All areas and items still need to be properly disinfected, but the first step is to mechanically clean them. Water can also be used to spray down outside areas to help remove any dried poop or vomit. Diluting an area such as a lawn by spraying with water may also help, but only if drainage and temperature allow the yard to thoroughly dry afterward. Bathe any dogs using regular dog shampoo who were exposed or infected and recovered, as well as other dogs who had contact with the infected dog or area. This will help to decrease the risk of fomite transmission from their fur. Use an Effective Virucidal Disinfectant When choosing a disinfectant, make sure it has been proven to kill parvovirus. A label claiming to kill viruses does not mean it killsallviruses, such as the hearty, non-enveloped parvovirus. Additionally, any disinfectant must be mixed to the proper dilution and remain saturated for the proper contact time to be effective against parvovirus. Independent studies or FDA approval backing label claims are the most reliable means of determining a disinfectant's effectiveness. Types of Disinfectants Quaternary Ammonium Disinfectant Despite its popularity for many years and label claims of efficacy against parvovirus, independent studies have shown this disinfectant to be unreliable against parvovirus. The label claims are based on diluting at 18 ounces per gallon, which is four times the typical concentration. Despite repeated reformulation and label claims,this is not seen as a reliable disinfectant against parvovirusand is not endorsed by independent studies or label-approved by the FDA.It must be rinsed off. 5% Sodium Hypochlorite (Bleach) Bleach can kill parvovirus when it is used properly. It is readily available and relatively inexpensive but has some drawbacks. It can discolor or even ruin surfaces. The fumes can be irritating to the nose, eyes, and skin. Bleach is most effective on non-porous surfaces from which organic material has been thoroughly removed. For areas where you can safely use bleach, dilute household bleach (5% sodium hypochlorite) using 1 part bleach to 32 parts water (that's 1/2 cup per gallon of water). The diluted bleach must have ten minutes of contact time with the surface, which means saturating the area or continually spraying for ten minutes. It must be rinsed off. Potassium Peroxymonosulfate Disinfectant This disinfectant has some detergent properties, meaning it is effective for mechanically removing organic matter, such as vomit and feces. It can be irritating to the skin and eyes. The label claims efficacy against parvovirus at 1% dilution, even when mixed with hard water or organic material. It can be used in carpet cleaners to clean carpets and furniture (spot test for staining first) and can also be sprayed on yard surfaces. The area must remain saturated for ten minutes. It can be left to dry and does not need to be rinsed. Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide (AHP) Disinfectant This disinfectant has become widely used in animal shelters, where CPV is not uncommon. Its detergent properties make it effective even when there is some organic matter. It can be used in one step for mechanical cleaning and to kill the virus. As in the other disinfectants discussed, proper dilutions and contact time are crucial to ensuring it kills the virus. It should be diluted using one part AHP to 32 parts water (1/2 cup per gallon of water) with a ten-minute contact time. This can be irritating to breathe but is less corrosive to surfaces and mucous membranes than bleach. It can be used in carpet cleaners and sprayed on grassy surfaces as well. It can be left to dry and does not need to be rinsed. The Yard Careful and repeated removal of all visible feces is important. If possible, flush the yard with water and allow it to dry. Then apply a disinfectant that is effective with organic material, such as AHP or potassium peroxymonosulfate. These can be used with a pesticide sprayer or hose-end sprayer at the proper dilution to saturate the outside area. Diluted bleach may also be somewhat effective, but since it does not perform as well with organic matter it is less effective than the others. Bleach is also more dangerous to plant life and other surfaces. If your yard has dirt and grass, rather than just cement, there is no guarantee any disinfectant will be 100% effective. It is best to thoroughly clean, dry, disinfect with the proper contact time and dry at least twice. When possible, maximize exposure to sunlight and allow the area to dry completely. In most home yard situations where there is grass and dirt, it is not possible to completely disinfect a yard. Out of an abundance of caution, you may want to avoid having unvaccinated dogs come to your yard for 6 to 12 months, even after cleaning and attempting to disinfect. The House It helps to understand the difference between porous and non-porous surfaces. Water can go through porous materials. Non-porous materials include stainless steel, glass, metals, rigid plastics, and painted or varnished surfaces. Granite countertops are porous, but quartz is not. Porous materials include unpolished wood, laminate, granite, drywall, carpeting, ceiling tiles, and unsealed cement. As mentioned, the first step is thoroughly cleaning the house and removing any feces or vomit that can be seen. Once all areas have been mechanically cleaned, you are ready to disinfect. Non-porous surfaces can be disinfected with diluted bleach or AHP or potassium peroxymonosulfate. Make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions for the proper dilution and contact times for parvovirus. For carpets and porous surfaces, AHP or potassium peroxymonosulfate disinfectants can be used in carpet cleaners to steam clean carpets and furniture. Understand that these areas are sometimes impossible to disinfect and heavily soiled items should be discarded if possible. Make sure you read the carpet cleaner instructions and spot-test any porous surfaces for possible discoloration. These surfaces will need to remain saturated for ten minutes to ensure the proper contact time. After disinfecting, the areas need to dry thoroughly. Bedding, Porous Items, or Toys Bedding and other fabric or porous items should either be thrown away, especially if heavily soiled, or washed thoroughly with detergent, hot water, and bleach and run through a hot dryer cycle if possible. If it is not possible to bleach the items, you could steam clean them with disinfectant as recommended for carpet and furniture. Consider if it is worth the risk to keep porous items such as bedding and toys that can't be bleached, or if it is better to throw them away. Exposed Bowls and Non-Porous Items Metal or ceramic bowls and non-porous toys should be washed thoroughly with a detergent, rinsed well, and then disinfected using an effective disinfectant. Throw away any plastic bowls that have any signs of wear, scratches, or teeth marks, which create porous areas. Proper dilution and contact time are important. This can be achieved by soaking the cleaned items in the diluted disinfectant for ten minutes, then allowing the items to dry. After disinfecting, thoroughly rinse the items with water and allow them to dry. When is my Home Safe? Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed time frame. There has not been any research that definitively states canine parvovirus can be eliminated from a home or yard environment in a specific number of days. There are many factors that affect whether cleaning and disinfecting efforts will be effective inside the house and outside in the yard. After a parvovirus-positive dog has been in your home or yard, it is safest to only have animals visit who have completed their vaccination series.

Category: Tetanus in Pets (Lock Jaw)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We have all heard of tetanus shots and have some sense that we are supposed to periodically get them, especially after exposure to some sort of dirty wound or bite. Some of us may even know that tetanus is sometimes referred to as lock jaw, but the general knowledge of tetanus generally does not extend much beyond that. Unless you work with livestock, you may not realize that tetanus is a concern for animals as well as for people.Tetanus is a disease caused by a toxin secreted by a bacterium known asClostridium tetani, one of many toxin-secretingClostridia. These bacteria are anaerobic, meaning that they grow in conditions where there is no oxygen (such as a deep bite wound or puncture).Clostridiaare soil bacteria, meaning that they live in dirt so it should be easy to see how a puncture contaminated with dirt would be a classical tetanus-yielding wound. Such wounds are particularly common on farms where there might be nails or bits of wire on the ground, ready to pierce a human or animal foot, but there is nothing special about rusted metal in predisposing to tetanus. The puncture can come from any pointed object. The pointy object provides the puncture (an anaerobic wound) and contamination with dirt provides theClostridia. A fight involving a bite wound and rolling around in dirt might similarly offer an opportunity for tetanus. Different animal species have different sensitivity to the tetanus toxin. Horses, humans, and livestock are more sensitive while cats are quite resistant and almost never get infected. We will be confining our discussion primarily to dogs. The Course of the Disease The tetanus toxin is called tetanospasmin. It is produced by the bacteriumClostridium tetaniin a wound. The toxin binds to local nerves and migrates up into the central nervous system where it interferes with the release of glycine and GABA, both of which are inhibitory neurotransmitters. The result of this loss of inhibition is painful muscle over-activity, spasms and rigidity. In severe cases, the patient cannot breathe because of the rigid paralysis of the respiratory muscles and a mechanical ventilator is required. As a human disease, tetanus has been known and described since ancient times. In the modern world, human death is unusual and is mostly limited to infants and to the elderly, but even in these groups mortality is only 10-15 percent. The incubation period of tetanus is 3 to 21 days, with 5 to 10 days from the original wound being more typical. Classically, the patient first loses the ability to blink and must flash the third eyelid to moisten the eye. The patient becomes sensitive to light and sound such that clapping one’s hands can actually create spasms or seizures. Dogs with ears that hang down may actually develop ears that stand up straight, and the facial muscles pull back in such a way as to create what is called the risus sardonicus or sardonic smile. In more advanced stages, the patient can no longer walk and stands stiffly in what is called a sawhorse stance. In an advanced state of disease, the patient cannot walk or even sit up and is at risk for aspiration of saliva or food contents. If the jaws are locked, feeding may be impossible and if the respiratory muscles become involved, the patient will not be able to effectively breathe. In dogs, a localized tetanus is more common than the generalized (whole body form) and only the limb nearest the original wound becomes rigid or will tremor. This is an easier form to treat compared to the more generalized; however, the localized form can spread and become the generalized form. In the generalized form, initial signs seem to pertain to the eyes and can easily be mistaken for eye disease in the early stages. Testing There is no test for tetanus in the way you might hope: no blood test or unique finding. The diagnosis is generally made based on the appearance of the animal and history of a wound. It is possible to measure antibody levels against the tetanus toxin but this has not been widely used in the clinical setting. Attempting to cultureClostridium tetanifrom the wound is generally not successful. Therapy The first step in treatment is antibiotics to kill theClostridia. Happily, unusual antibiotics are not needed: penicillin works quite well for this classical gram positive rod.Clindamycinandmetronidazoleare also felt to be effective. Improvement is usually obvious in the first week of treatment. Sedation is necessary to control the spasms and/or seizures.Acepromazineand chlorpromazine have been recommended to control the sensitivity to light and noise. The patient will need a darkened quiet room and may need his eyes covered to reduce stimulation. These medications can promote seizures in other sets of circumstances, but tetanus is the exception. Injectable pentobarbital,phenobarbital, propofol, methocarbamol,diazepam, or midazolam can be used to control the muscles stiffness. Patients for whom respiratory compromise is a concern (when the respiratory muscles are affected or if there is larynx spasm) may actually need days of general anesthesia, an endotracheal tube (tube in the windpipe to keep an airway open) or even a mechanical ventilator. The decision on whether or not to include tetanus antitoxin is more controversial. Antitoxin is an antibody solution (a blood product) generated by either a horse or human to bind and destroy the tetanus toxin. It cannot remove toxin already bound to the patient’s nerves but can inactivate new toxin not yet bound. Toxin that is already bound to nerves simply has to unbind in time on its own. There is a risk in using antitoxin because it is a blood product of another species and highly inflammatory to the immune system. Antitoxin can be given under the skin or in the muscle but can take up to 3 days to reach a therapeutic level this way. Giving it by IV is more rapid but also more dangerous in terms of inducing an anaphylactic reaction. Skin testing is commonly used to see how reactive the patient might be. It is potentially helpful in early stages of disease only. Tetanus toxoid is the tetanus shot most of us have had at one time or another. It is a vaccine against the tetanus toxin and it is part of a horse’s regular vaccination set, just as it is part of a human’s vaccination set. Because dogs and cats are much more resistant to tetanus than horses and humans, regular vaccination against tetanus is not recommended for them. Nursing care requires a darkened room with minimal stimulation even if the pet no longer requires hospitalization. Clenched jaws can be problematic for feeding so expect a liquid diet or slurry to be needed. Soft bedding to prevent bedsores is a must. Improvement is generally noted within the first week of therapy but complete recovery can easily take a month. Some Tetanus Statistics Most of the information in this article has been gleaned from a study by Burkittet alpublished in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in January 2007 where 35 cases of canine tetanus seen at the University of California Veterinary Teaching hospital were reviewed for analysis. Severity Classes For the purposes of the study mentioned above, cases were classified by the severity of their signs into four groups. It is important to realize that a dog’s initial classification could easily change (in this study 17 dogs that were normal or in Group I at the beginning of the study ended in Group III or IV). Group I The dog was able to walk but also demonstrated constricted pupils, risus sardonicus, erect ears, inability to open its jaws, sunken eyes, and/or sensitivity to light. Group II All of the above plus erect tail, sawhorse stance, difficulty swallowing, walking stiffly with difficulty. Group III All of the above plus muscle tremors or spasms, inability to walk, and seizures. Group IV All of the above plus any of the following: heart rate below 60 beats per minute, heart rate above 140 beats per minute, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, or respiratory arrest. Study Results Overall, of the 35 dogs included in the UC Davis study, 77 percent survived. All of the dogs that did not progress beyond the severity of Group II survived and 50% of the dogs in Groups III and IV survived. Dogs in these latter two groups required continuous care (intravenous fluids, sedation, nutritional support, etc.) In 27 percent of cases, the initial wound was afoxtail tractand an additional 50 percent of wounds were suspicious of foxtail tract. A foxtail, or grass awn, is a sharp plant tuft that easily gets caught in fur and migrates deep into a wound, ending up in an assortment of inopportune areas of the body. An important conclusion of this study was that the wound need not be a bite or traumatic puncture.

Category: Tick Paralysis in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Tick Paralysis? Tick paralysis (also known as tick bite paralysis, or tick toxicosis) is caused by neurotoxins secreted in saliva by certain species of female ticks. Neurotoxins are chemicals that damage nerve cells and can cause a wide array of symptoms, including paralysis (the loss of mobility and movement), due to nerve toxins in tick saliva. There are differences in ticks all over the world, and the health impacts they may have. In this article, we concentrate on tick paralysis information for species found in North America, Europe, and Australia. Regional and Tick Species Differences In North America,DermacentorandIxodes spp. are primarily involved. Tick paralysis exclusively affects dogs in North America. The disease has not been reported in domestic cats. In Australia,Ixodes holocyclus, Ixodes cornuatus, andIxodex hirstiare primarily involved in dog and cat cases. Female adults ofI. holocyclusare mainly responsible for tick paralysis in the eastern coastal region of Australia, although larvae or nymphs can trigger neurotoxicosis if they are present in large numbers.I. cornuatusis responsible for the disease mainly in south-eastern Australia and Tasmania. In Europe,Rhipicephalus sanguineusis responsible for most canine cases. Feline cases have not been reported in Europe. Clinical Signs of Tick Paralysis in North America Not all ticks produce the toxin and not all tick-infested animals develop paralysis. Signs usually occur five to nine days after tick attachment, and include: Clinical Signs of Tick Paralysis In Europe Signs of tick paralysis are similar to that of North American cases, and animals have symmetrical signs. Clinical Signs of Tick Paralysis In Australia Because the species of ticks are different, in Australia the neurologic signs observed in pets are more severe and rapidly progressive in affected animals.  Both dogs and cats can be affected, and paralysis of all legs can develop within hours. Other signs include: In one study, asymmetrical signs were observed in 8% of dogs withI. holocyclustick paralysis. In the asymmetrical cases, tick(s) were present on the same side as the neurologic problems. Paralysis of the respiratory muscles is more common than in North America and death can occur within one to two days if treatment is ineffective or inadequate. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, finding a tick on the body of the patient, and rapid resolution of clinical signs after removal of the tick. (Either manual removal or treatment with a quick-kill, anti-tick product.) Diseases that can be confused with tick paralysis and that will need to be ruled out by your veterinarian are acute polyradiculoneuritis (a disease that causes paralysis and sometimes facial and vocal weakness), botulism (another motor paralysis condition caused by eating the toxic bacteriaClostridium botulinum), andmyasthenia gravis(a crisis form of this disease, which means rapid onset of full body weakness, respiratory failure, and megaesophagus). Specific Therapies   Tick RemovalWhen tick paralysis is suspected, your veterinarian will examine your pet thoroughly for ticks. This may include whole-body clipping for long-haired dogs. All areas of the body will be checked, and all ticks found will be removed. Removal is the primary means of treatment. Your veterinarian may apply a medication to kill parasites (a parasiticide) on the skin/fur. However, it can take the parasiticide up to 48-72 hours to kill any remaining ticks present on your pet, and some may be younger, smaller, and difficult to see. Because it is sometimes difficult to remove all ticks in this situation, clinical signs may progress during this time. For tick paralysis in North America and Europe, removal/death of tick(s) and supportive care are frequently all that is required, because clinical signs improve rapidly after the tick stops feeding. In Australia, tick removal may work if clinical signs have not yet developed. If signs have already started, more treatment of the signs and/or antiserum will be required to control the toxicosis. Tick Antiserum Immunity to tick neurotoxins after being exposed in the past, or natural immunity. has been described in dogs that have survived tick paralysis; however, natural immunity doesn’t last long, and the animal can develop tick paralysis again after another tick bite. In Australia, tick antiserum (TAS, tick antivenom, tick antitoxin) from hyperimmune dogs may help in the treatment of tick paralysis. Controlled clinical studies are lacking, but there is strong evidence from users of TAS that commercially available TAS is beneficial when dealing with the Australian toxin. However, administration of TAS carries the risk of drug reactions, so your veterinarian will weigh the positives and negatives of the use of this antiserum. Supportive CareSupportive care is extremely important for paralyzed patients. Such care may include intravenous fluid therapy, physiotherapy, urinary bladder management, and hand feeding with the animal in a sternal (laying on the belly) or vertical position (sitting on the bottom, sometimes in a specialized chair) for dogs that have developed megaesophagus. In addition, a feeding tube may be considered. If there is lung damage, antibiotics may be necessary. If there are eye problems, eye lubricants may be needed. Respiratory failure is a major complication of tick paralysis, especially fromI. holocyclus, so oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation, where a tube is placed into the lungs and attached to a ventilation machine to assist with breathing, may be required. Prognosis In North America, the prognosis for tick paralysis due toDeramacenter variabilisorDeramacenter Andersoniiis good, provided all ticks on the patient are removed or killed and adequate nursing care is provided. Removing the tick(s) results in an improvement in signs within hours. Complete recovery usually occurs within one to three days. Occasionally, muscle weakness may persist for weeks, but most patients fully recover from this disease when treated appropriately. Death can occur in untreated dogs from paralysis of the respiratory muscles. In Australia, the prognosis for tick paralysis due toIxodes holcylusis guarded and recovery may be prolonged. In Australia, tick removal may suffice if clinical signs have not yet developed. Otherwise, the clinical signs will progress if appropriate medical treatment is not done. Dogs less than six months of age and small breed dogs are at significantly higher risk of death. Dogs with low oxygen levels have a better chance of survival if they receive mechanical ventilation than if they do not. Occasional cases of sudden death have been reported within a few weeks of recovery. Therefore, your veterinarian will recommend that your pet have a non-stressful, 2-week resting period after recovery. Preventing Tick Paralysis The best way to prevent tick paralysis is to usetick control products.Check pets daily and remove any ticks. Always see your veterinarian right away if you notice any concerning signs after a tick bite.

Category: Viral Papillomas of Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Does my Dog Have Warts? Certain viruses are able to cause the growth of small round skin tumors commonly referred to as warts. Everyone who has ever seen a drawing of a fairy tale witch knows what warts look like, so when the family dog develops small round skin growths, many people assume these, too, are harmless warts. It is important to realize that viral warts are a specific condition and that a growth on the dog’s skin may or may not be a viral wart. Very few skin growths can be identified visually and many types of skin growths look similar.  Before assuming a growth is "just a wart," it is a good idea to learn about warts (viral papillomas) in case what you are seeing doesn't really fit and needs further evaluation. Human warts are round, somewhat flat, and relatively smooth. Viral warts in dogs tend to possess frond-like structures (called fimbriae), creating more of a sea anemone or cauliflower-like appearance, though they can be smooth as well. The classical viral wart patient is a young dog with warts in or around the mouth or eyes. In cases where warts have a typical appearance in a classic patient, diagnosis may be obvious, but in older patients with warts in locations other than the face, other types of growths become more likely. Because many types of growths can appear harmless but behave malignantly, removal and biopsy are often recommended, especially if the appearance of the growth and/or patient does not fit into what is considered typical. It is usually not possible to identify a growth visually though there are some exceptions. Do not be surprised if what you are assuming is a wart is reallysomething else. In dogs, we do not call these growths warts; we use the more formal term: viral papilloma. As in people, viral papillomas are caused by a papillomavirus, although dogs and people have different papillomaviruses and cannot transmit their viruses across species lines. What Do These Papillomas Look Like? By far, the most common type of viral papilloma in dogs is near the mouth, caused by CPV1 (canine papillomavirus-1). Viral papillomas are classically fimbriated, meaning they are round but often have a rough, almost jagged surface reminiscent of a sea anemone or a cauliflower. They occur usually on the lips and muzzle of a young dog (usually less than 2 years of age). Less commonly, papillomas can occur on the eyelids and even the surface of the eye or between the toes. Usually, they occur in groups rather than as solitary growths so if one growth is noted, check inside the mouth and lips for more. When the viral papilloma has a classic appearance like the ones shown above, a biopsy is usually not needed to identify the growth. In cases where there is uncertainty, however, a biopsy will settle any questions. The good news is that most oral viral papilloma cases are mild and resolve on their own within 2 months. How is this Virus Transmitted? The infection is transmitted through direct contact with the papillomas on an infected dog or with the virus in the pet’s environment (on toys, bedding, food bowls, etc.). The virus requires injured skin to establish infection; healthy skin will not be infected. The incubation period is 1 to 2 months. This virus can only be spread among dogs. It is not contagious to other pet species or to humans, and it appears not to be contagious after the lesion has regressed. Recovered dogs cannot be infected with the same strain of virus but there are several viral strains. To become infected, the dog generally needs an immature immune system or a suppressed immune system, thus this infection is primarily one of young dogs and puppies.  Dogs taking cyclosporine orally to treat immune-mediated disease may also have an outbreak of papilloma lesions. The canine papillomavirus has been shown to be able to survive at least two months at temperatures of 40º F but only six hours at 98º F. Are Viral Papillomas Dangerous? Not really. They should go away on their own as the dog’s immune system matures and generates a response against the papillomavirus. The process of regression usually takes 1 to 2 months. If lesions are still there after 3 months, treatment is recommended (see below) and a biopsy may be needed to confirm that the growth really is a viral papilloma. Severe cases can actually interfere with chewing and swallowing, but such heavy involvement is unusual. Sometimes oral papillomas can become infected with bacteria from the mouth. Antibiotics will be needed in such cases to control the pain, swelling, and bad breath. Treatment In most cases, treatment is unnecessary; they simply go away on their own. Occasionally an unfortunate dog will have a huge number of papillomas, so many that consuming food becomes a problem. Papillomas can be surgically removed or frozen off cryogenically. Sometimes crushing several growths seems to stimulate the host’s immune system to assist in the tumor regression process. In humans, anti-viral doses of interferon have been used to treat severe cases of warts, and this treatment is also available for severely infected dogs though it is costly and yields inconsistent results. More recently, a topical medication called imiquimod has been used in both canine and human infections to help boost immune-mediated inflammation and thus facilitate the destruction of the virus by the body. Imiquimod is being prescribed increasingly for dogs with viral papillomas on their skin. Skin irritation is frequently noted adjacent to the growth when imiquimod is in use, but this is generally regarded as a sign that the growth is regressing and the medication is working. A research group in Turkey in 2008 reported excellent success using a 10-day course of azithromycin. Treatment was able to remove all lesions within 15 days, with no recurrences reported in the subsequent 8 months of the study. Subsequent results have been mixed; however, this therapy is frequently used in more stubborn cases as the medication is reasonably priced and readily available. Sometimes some of the warts can be removed and made into a vaccine of sorts. The vaccine helps stimulate the patient's immune system so that the virus and tumors can be made to regress naturally. Making the vaccine requires DNA from the patient's virus and can be used as either treatment or prevention. Special biologic companies use their technology to custom-make tumor vaccines in this way. For more information, visit Torigen.com Other Types of Papillomas The oral papilloma is by far the most common canine viral papilloma, but it is certainly not the only kind. There are other papillomaviruses besides CPV-1. Here are other types of viral papillomas: Cutaneous Inverted Papillomas (Also Called Endophytic Warts)These are caused by the CPV-2 papillomavirus as well as other papillomaviruses. They can appear as single nodules on the belly (1/2- 1 inch across) with a small central pore or they can be disseminated like a lumpy rash. They can also form between the dog's toes. Papillomavirus Pigmented PlaquesThese are caused by several of the "Chi canine papillomaviruses" and usually affect pugs and miniature schnauzers. They are dark, scaly, and of variable size and are usually found on the belly. Unlike other papillomas, these do not regress on their own except in pugs. They are capable of transforming into malignancy. Digital PapillomasThese are caused by the CPV-2 papillomavirus as well as other papillomaviruses and grow on the foot pads and between the toes. They tend to be painful and have the potential to transform into malignancy. These non-oral papillomas do not possess the classic fimbriated appearance of the oral papilloma and are likely to require biopsy for identification. As with oral papillomas, though, they can be expected to regress in most cases within a 2-month time frame. If they do not, the same treatments noted above can be applied.

Category: When You Need Antibiotics for Your Pets, and When You Don’t
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Antibiotics can be literal life savers for your pet when they have the kind of infection that responds to the medication. However, when given for something where they are not appropriate — such as a virus — antibiotics can create a long-lasting problem of antibiotic resistance, lessening the future ability of antibiotics to cure. Using antibiotics for viral illnesses such as colds simply doesn’t do anything to get rid of the cold, but it may create drug-resistant bacteria that are much harder to kill because they no longer respond to typical doses of regular antibiotics. Using large doses of less commonly used antibiotics may not treat the problem either or may simply cause more resistance. Both bacteria and viruses are germs and can make dogs or cats (or people) sick. The two types of germs can cause diseases with similar symptoms, but each one has a different way of multiplying and spreading disease. Diarrhea, for example, can have several different causes, some of which are bacterial, and some are viral. The difference between the two types of germs is that bacteria are living organisms and viruses are not. Bacteria are only single-cell organisms, but they are still considered alive. Viruses are essentially a collection of molecules that work together to replicate, so they only grow and reproduce after they've invaded living cells. Like all other species, their main goal is to replicate. Antibiotics fight living organisms – the bacteria – by killing them or stopping their growth and reproduction, but they can’t do that for viruses. Your own immune system can successfully fight some viruses, but sometimes, such as after catching a common cold, viruses must simply run their course and there is little anyone can do to shorten the time frame. You can treat symptoms such as coughing and headache, but not the disease itself. Your pets are the same way. Many diseases veterinarians see are only viral in nature and that’s the point at which you do not want to give your pet antibiotics. Such viruses include: Some bacterial diseases develop after a virus has made it easier for bacteria to infect. Examples include: Many organs can be infected with bacteria. Bacterial infections include: Taking antibiotics too often or for the wrong reasons can change bacteria so much that antibiotics don't work against them. Giving antibiotics when they are not indicated can have two effects that can profoundly impact the health of your patient. The first is killing healthy bacteria. Not all bacteria are bad, in fact most are probably beneficial. Beneficial bacteria protect from disease-causing bacteria, promote a healthy immune system, and help the body with metabolism. Bacteria in the gut are particularly important, however, bacteria are crucial to the health of many organs. The second effect of antibiotic use is the potential for antibiotic resistance. This means that when a pet has a bacterial infection that could have been treated by antibiotics, the drugs may not be able to help end the infection; your pet will still be sick despite treatment. This can be true if the pet already has received antibiotics, even a different antibiotic.  One example is skin infections.  In some cases, pets can end up with methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus pseudintermedius(MRSP or MRSA).MRSA and MRSPare resistant to numerous drugs and adapt quickly to the immune system, so they are a big concern in the veterinary community. Another common organism that rapidly develops resistance is Escherichia coli, (usually called E. coli), which usually infects the urinary bladder. Your veterinarian understands these risks and may suggest that antibiotics not be used if alternative treatments might be better. Examples include: Thankfully, you can help your pet avoid antibiotic resistance in several ways: The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Degenerative Myelopathy Leads to Paralysis of Dog's Hindquarters
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Degenerative myelopathy (also known as DM, German shepherd degenerative myelopathy, or chronic degenerative radiculomyelopathy) is a slowly progressive disease that affects the spinal cord and a dog's ability to walk. DM results in lost coordination of the hind legs, which progresses to weakness and then to paralysis of the hindquarters. What happens is that the structures within the spinal cord that are responsible for nerve impulses degenerate. In degenerative myelopathy, the myelin (the insulation around the nerve fibers) and the nerve fibers that carry signals to the muscles do not communicate so the nerve's signals to move are not followed. While these changes can happen anywhere along the spinal cord, they usually happen in the mid to lower back. Typically, degenerative myelopathy isn't seen in dogs under the age of five. The degeneration occurs slowly over a period of several months. Often the first signs noticed are difficulty in the hind quarters when the dog is getting up. This awkwardness is most noticeable when the dog walks on a smooth surface. However, as the disease progresses, the dog becomes uncoordinated and will scuff or drag the rear feet, causing excessive wearing of the toenails. Sometimes one side is more noticeably uncoordinated than the other. The disease can either wax and wane episodically or progress steadily. It usually takes a few months to a year after onset for a dog to become unable to walk. Cause The cause is a DNA mutation in a gene called superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). This risk factor of having this gene was identified in 2009. Prior to this discovery, genetic, nutritional, and immune factors were suggested as possible causes of DM. The neurologic disease is similar to some forms of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, often called Lou Gehrig's disease) AND  DM usually affects dogs that are between 8 and 14 years old. Though most of the dogs in early reports were German Shepherd Dogs (GSD), other breeds that have the mutation and clinical signs include American Water Spaniel, Bernese mountain dog, Bloodhound, Borzoi, Boxer, Canaan Dog, Chesapeake Bay retriever, English Cocker Spaniel, German Shepherd Dog, Great Pyrenees, Kerry blue terrier, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Pug, Sealyham terrier, and Whippet. Signs Early signs, such as difficulty getting up or a noticeable sway in the dog's gait, may be confused with hip dysplasia.  As months go by, "scuffing" of the hind limb toe nails or dragging of the hind limb feet usually is noted. The rear limbs may criss-cross when standing or walking.  The dog may not be able to stand well and during an examination a veterinarian will detect rear limb weakness. Muscles of the rear limbs will become atrophied or wasted away.  As the disease progresses, the front legs may become weak. Fortunately, dogs with DM do not appear to be in pain. Diagnosing Since the clinical signs of DM can appear the same as those for other diseases such as a herniated disk, cancer, infection, or stenosis of the spine, the diagnosis in a live animal is based on excluding these diseases.  Thus a variety of diagnostic tests is needed, including physical and neurological examinations, routine blood work, spinal radiographs, myelography in some cases, spinal fluid analysis, and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.  Unfortunately a definitive diagnosis can only be ascertained after death by looking at biopsy samples from the spinal cord. DNA testing by theOrthopedic Foundation for Animalscan identify the DNA mutation that is associated with the development of DM. The test identifies dogs that are clear and have two normal copies of the gene, carriers who have one normal copy and one mutated copy, and those who are at much higher risk for developing DM because they have two mutated copies. In unpublished studies, dogs who have two of the abnormal genes are the only ones that have developed the disease.  However, there are some dogs in these studies with two mutated genes and without clinical signs; it is unclear yet whether these dogs will later develop the disease or if other factors are necessary for DM to develop. The DM DNA Test may be performed on any breed or mixed (hybrid) breed.  By testing before breeding, breeders will be able to avoid mating two dogs with the mutated DNA. As part of an ongoing collaborative effort by research scientists at the University of Missouri and the Broad Institute, a DNA test is available for dogs that have been diagnosed with DM, and for older dogs in selected breeds. Details are outlined in theResearchsection of that website. Treatment Unfortunately no treatment has been shown to reverse the signs; DM can be managed but not cured. Supportive treatment can help. Breeding and Prevention Because the disease is found in specific breeds, responsible breeding is the only way to prevent degenerative myelopathy. If you plan to get a purebred puppy of an affected breed, ask the breeder about history of DM in the kennel’s line. Understand that clinical signs don't develop until long after sexual maturity. The DM gene mutation is very common in some breeds, such as the German shepherd. Overly aggressive breeding programs to remove the gene mutation may create a bottleneck effect, possibly increasing the risk of other diseases and eliminating other desirable qualities of the breed. A realistic approach is to consider the DNA DM results as you would consider any other undesirable trait or fault. Dogs testing at risk should be considered to have a more serious fault than those testing as carriers. Prognosis Most affected dogs are euthanized due to disability within 6 to 12 months of onset of signs. 1Daily controlled physiotherapy increases survival time in dogs with suspected degenerative myelopathy.J Vet Intern Med. 2006 Jul-Aug;20(4):927-32.

Category: Lumbosacral Disease in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The cauda equina is made of the tail end of the spinal cord and the adjacent nerve roots. Sometimes, the spinal canal, through which the spinal cord and nerves pass, narrows and then compresses the nerves. The most common spot for this narrowing is at the lumbosacral joint, where the spine meets the pelvis. Spinal canal narrowing at that joint is referred to as lumbosacral stenosis, and the condition resulting from these compressed spinal nerve roots is called cauda equina syndrome or lumbosacral compression syndrome. Sometimes, these changes can be congenital (an animal is born with it), but they can also develop as the dog gets older. Causes In some cases, the foramina (the holes through which the spinal nerves exit) becomes narrowed and compress the nerves either permanently or intermittently. Intermittent compression is common in very athletic dogs. Narrowing of the spinal canal is most often caused by arthritic degeneration or intervertebral disc herniation, but traumatic injury, congenital malformation, or tumor growth can also be involved. Narrowing of the foramina can be caused by new bone growth, the spurs that grow as a result of arthritis, or by overgrown soft tissue from the capsule surrounding the joints. The most common symptom of lumbosacral stenosis is pain. In the beginning, you may notice your dog has hind end stiffness that leads to difficulty in walking, climbing stairs, getting on furniture, wagging the tail, positioning to defecate, or getting into a car. As the condition progresses, one or both back legs may become weak. Some dogs will cry out in pain when trying to move. In severe cases, the nerve roots can become so compressed that urinary and fecal incontinence will result; however, this is less frequently seen.Trapping of the nerves can also cause intermittent pain and leg tremors, depending on the dog's position. German shepherd dogs and other large, active breeds are most commonly affected. However, it can also affect smaller breeds and even cats. Signs in dogs younger than three to seven years old are unusual. Diagnosis When you present your dog to a veterinarian, they will take a thorough history from you to determine what signs you are seeing at home. If you can capture your pet moving/walking at home on video, this may be helpful to your veterinarian. They may also observe your dog walking and possibly getting in/out of the car or going up and down stairs at the clinic. A physical examination will then be performed, including an orthopedic examination to check the bones and joints followed by a neurological examination to assess nerve function.  Several tests will then be performed to locate the site of pain. This may involve manipulating both back legs, pushing on the spine, or moving the tail. Additional diagnostic tests are usually required to establish the diagnosis. These can include X-rays, CT scans, MRI, and rarely electromyography, a diagnostic procedure that evaluates the health of the muscles and the nerve cells that control them. Advanced imaging techniques - especially MRI - have become the tests of choice for lumbosacral disease and are now thought to be essential when planning treatment, whether this be medical or surgical. Treatment Treating lumbosacral disease depends on the cause and severity of the symptoms. Mild cases often need only supportive treatment, including crate rest, controlled exercise on lead, and anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving medications. Sometimes, injections around the spinal cord, usually steroids, are needed. If symptoms persist or worsen or if neurologic signs develop, surgery may be required. A dorsal laminectomy creates an opening in the top of the spinal canal to relieve pressure from the nerves. Occasionally, adjacent unstable spinal vertebrae may have to be fused to prevent recurrent nerve trauma. If the foramina are narrowed, they may also need to be widened, which can be done in the same surgery. Strict rest in the postoperative period is essential to minimize complications. Outlook (Prognosis) Dogs with mild signs have a good prognosis as they can be medically treated. Severely affected dogs, including those whose nerve root compression is so severe that urinary or fecal incontinence has resulted, have a poor prognosis as most dogs do not become continent again, even after surgery.  However, surgery or epidural cortisone can relieve pain and improve quality of life.

Category: Paralyzed Dogs: How to Care for Them
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Unfortunately, spinal damage leading to rear leg paralysis is not an uncommon problem in pets. The animal will be normal from the point of the spinal injury upward and paralyzed from the point of the injury downward. These animals are colloquially called downer animals and have special management needs. Rarely is rear paralysis temporary, so long-term management will require commitment. It is not for everyone, and it is important to understand what you are getting into; however, for the right owner and patient, management of the downer can be rewarding, and the human/animal bond can continue. Cleanliness The downer animal is frequently also a victim of urinary and fecal incontinence and, of course, will have limited ability to groom. It is important that the animal be bathed frequently for the sake of your household as well as the animal's sense of cleanliness. This is obviously more practical for the smaller pet. Expect to have to bathe the animal every few days at least to prevent odor issues as well as urine scald on the skin. TIP: If dry skin becomes a problem with frequent baths, a moisturizing rinse can be obtained from your vet. TIP: Be sure to maintain good flea control.  You will need a waterproofflea product. TIP: Dry shampoo is available at some pet supply stores and may be helpful for spot cleaning. TIP: To avoid urine scald, use a barrier spray. These sprays are made for people who are confined to bedded areas to protect their skin against urine irritation. Do not usezincoxide-based cremes (commonly used for diaper rash) on pets. Zinc oxide is toxic if licked. Baby wipes are especially handy in caring for the downer dog. Underpads come in assorted sizes and have a padded side and a plastic waterproof side. They are manufactured as a human incontinence products but have many pet-related uses. When it comes to protecting underlying carpeting or flooring upon which a downer dog is bedded, nothing beats an office chair/floor protector (or two, side by side, if need be). Towels, blankets, dog beds, food that may spill, etc., can all safely be placed on the protector. Diapers, wraps, and piddle pants for dogs are available at most pet supply stores. Another important concern regards the pet outdoors. Urine or fecal odors or damaged skin will attract flies readily. The animal will not be able to shoo flies properly. It only takes an hour on a hot day for fly eggs to turn into tissue-eating maggots (a condition called myiasis). If the tissues are deeply invaded, death may result. Be sure your pet is not allowed to attract flies. Bed Sores and Damaged Skin from Dragging The paralyzed pet will probably have some ability to drag himself or change positions somewhat, but be aware of sores developing on pressure points. Especially vulnerable areas include: elbows, ankles, and hips. If sores develop, see your veterinarian for care. Padding or bandages for these areas may be needed. Support garments to prevent pressure sores on the elbows and joints of the legs can be purchased. Similarly, the paralyzed pet may be very strong in the forelegs and move around with the rear quarters dragging. This can lead to scraped skin, especially if the pet does not have sensation in the rear limbs and cannot feel what would normally be quite painful. Again, be aware of the potential for this type of injury; special bandaging or padding may be needed. A specific type of harness can be a great help in your ability to move or carry your dog around, letting you keep the front or hind quarters raised when your dog can’t. An orthopedic bed is a crucial investment for the downer pet. These beds are designed to protect pressure points from bedsores. If your vet's office does not sell such a product, they are available through pet supply stores or online. TIP: When buying an orthopedic bed, be sure it is machine washable. Buy a second bed for use while one bed is in the laundry. It will not be helpful if only the cover of the bed is washable. Bladder Care and Infection Prevention The downer pet is often inefficient at keeping the bladder empty. This strongly predisposes the pet to bladder infections, which can go up to the kidney and cause big problems. Your pet may need periodic urine cultures to monitor for infection. Your veterinarian will give you a recommendation for your particular pet. Bladder infections are easily taken care of with a simple antibiotic, though a pretreatment urine culture can determine which antibiotic will be effective. Some people are able to tell when the pet has one by a change in the odor or coloration of the urine. If you notice any changes, notify your vet at once. Animals with spinal lesions at the level of the waist or higher will have excessive bladder tone (the so-called upper motor neuron bladder). This means that the bladder will require manual expression by pressing or squeezing. Your vet’s staff will show you how to do this. Emptying the bladder should be done a minimum of three times daily. If the bladder is allowed to remain over-filled, it will stretch out and become flaccid. After a couple of weeks, the upper motor neuron bladder develops into an automatic bladder, which means that when it fills, it will empty on its own. If the bladder has over-stretched in the first two weeks after the spinal injury, it will not be able to empty itself when, later on, it develops the neurologic capability to empty. It is important to learn how to express the bladder correctly, as simply squeezing a full bladder can rupture it. Spinal injuries of the lower back produce lower motor neuron bladder, which simply leaks and never has enough tone to fill. It is important not to assume that an animal can empty its own bladder simply because there is urine in the bedding. The full bladder may simply be overflowing. Regular emptying of the bladder is one of the best ways to prevent bladder infection. Carts Mobility carts are especially important for the paralyzed dog who is strong in the front legs. A dog with a strong upper body will be able to run and exercise in a cart, which is not only healthy but psychologically good as well. Carts are fitted according to your dog's measurements. Physical Therapy Muscles are more comfortable when kept flexible. As long as there are no dislocations or healing fractures, passive flexion and extension and light massage are very good for the paralyzed limbs. The joints of the leg are moved through the full range of natural motion and relaxed. This is repeated for about five to 10 minutes two to three times daily. Towel walking is also helpful in physical therapy in keeping muscles flexible and strong. Slip an appropriately sized towel under the belly and use it as a sling. The dog is lifted so as to walk relatively normally in the front with the towel as support in the back. As an alternative to the towel, several gadgets are marketed. Keep in mind that a dog supported from the rear may be difficult to lead. A second person "steering” in front may be helpful. Ask your veterinarian to show you how to do the exercises or give you a referral to aphysical therapist. Care of the downer dog requires commitment and dedication. If the dog is too big for one person to move, the effort is that much more. Still, for the right dog and human family, paralysis need not interrupt the bond.

Category: Pituitary Macroadenoma in Cushing's Syndrome
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources As you probably know at this stage, most Cushing's disease is caused by a pituitary tumor that is over-secreting its hormonal messages to the adrenal glands and causing all the excess stimulation that leads to all the symptoms of Cushing's disease. Most pituitary tumors responsible for Cushing’s disease are so small that their size is insignificant and we can concentrate on their hormone-producing issues only. In other words, it doesn't matter that the pituitary gland (and its tumor) is located at the base of the brain deep inside the skull as long as the tumor is very small; we can just worry about the hormones it produces and never mind its location. Approximately 10-20% of dogs with pituitary dependent Cushing’s disease have a tumor that actually is large enough to take up a meaningful amount of space, unfortunately. These tumors are called "macrotumors" and since there is not much extra space within the skull for extra structures, a macrotumor can compress normal brain tissue and lead to neurologic disease. Further, a pituitary tumor may not be macro at the time Cushing's disease is first diagnosed but may grow to become macro over the years to come. It is thus a good idea to become familiar with signs to watch for and even better to have periodic brain imaging to check the tumor's changing size. How Big is too Big? Ten millimeters (about half of an inch) is the size a pituitary tumor must reach to be categorized as a macrotumor in a human being. Dogs obviously have more variance in the size and shape of their skulls than do people thus it may be inaccurate to use the human definition for dogs but, so far, the veterinary profession has adopted the human description. It appears that up to 50% of dogs with pituitary tumors of this size do not have concurrent neurologic disease. We do not have information regarding how many of these asymptomatic dogs will go on to develop neurologic disease nor do we have rules for smaller dogs with smaller brains. Still, when a dog has a pituitary tumor of 10 mm in diameter and neurologic signs, the tumor should be considered the cause of the signs. In fact, the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine is using 8 mm as their cut-off size for recommending treatment. Is this Cancer? Not in the way most people think of cancer. Pituitary macrotumors are almost always benign in that they do not spread in any way. They can, however, produce harm simply because of their size and location. When Would an Owner Suspect a Pituitary Macrotumor? When a pituitary mass begins to expand, the owner is likely to notice subtle changes in behavior though nothing may be obvious even with a formal physical examination. The dog may seem just off, listless or may develop a poor appetite. Occasionally signs are more blatantly abnormal (walking in circles or seizures) but the subtle start is more common. It should be noted in particular that it is extremely abnormal for a dog with Cushing's disease not to have a good appetite even while on therapy. If a dog with Cushing's disease develops a poor appetite, they should be seen by the veterinarian promptly. Most dogs diagnosed with pituitary macroadenomas have been diagnosed with Cushing’s disease at least 6 months prior and are probably well controlled on medication, so this condition tends to appear out of the blue in an otherwise normal dog. In this situation, a macrotumor must be considered, especially if fresh blood testing does not reveal any new diseases. Of course, blatant neurologic signs in a dog with Cushing’s disease would definitely be suspicious for a pituitary macrotumor as well. Brachycephalic breeds (boxers, pugs etc.) tend to have the biggest pituitary tumors. How is Diagnosis Confirmed? Imaging of the brain is required to confirm a pituitary macrotumor and this means either CT (CAT scan) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). These procedures are expensive; for example, in Los Angeles brain imaging can easily cost a couple of thousand dollars. Special facilities are needed for the equipment involved, and referral to a specialty hospital is usually required. MRI is felt to be superior for imaging the pituitary gland and is the preferred imaging method for this situation; however, CT is more readily available. Both these imaging procedures are performed under general anesthesia and involve some risks. The equipment used is large and the patient must spend a good eight to 10 minutes without monitoring inside the equipment. Since MRI uses powerful magnets, normal anesthetic machines cannot be used (because they are metal) and injectable anesthetics are often needed. Injectable anesthesia is not as easily controlled as inhalation. At this time there is no blood test that can distinguish a macrotumor from a microtumor, but some promising tests are currently under investigation. How is a Pituitary Macrotumor Treated? While surgical removal of pituitary tumors is feasible in humans, the pituitary area is not nearly as accessible surgically in dogs. This means that radiation therapy is the only effective treatment available for pituitary macro tumors. Radiation therapy is performed usually two to three times weekly for four to six weeks and is an expensive undertaking of several thousand dollars. Of dogs that receive radiation therapy, 70 percent will have good improvement as a result with half of them having rapid improvement and the other half improving in the month or two following the course of therapy. Radiation therapy is not without complication. Common problems associated with this treatment include loss of pigment in the skin and hair in the area irradiated, hearing loss, and sometimes problems with tear production in the eyes. Many dogs experience a resolution of their Cushing’s disease if the pituitary tumor responds well, but one should plan to have to continue treatment for Cushing’s disease despite radiation as at least 50 percent still require treatment for their Cushing's disease. Very large tumors (greater than 25 mm in diameter) tend to be too big to respond. For this reason, early detection of the tumor is best and allows for more successful radiation therapy. Is Radiation Therapy Likely to be Curative? Unfortunately, no. The pituitary tumor is likely to recur in time (ranges are reported at 2.5 to 26 months for recurrence). Keep in mind that these patients are geriatric and might not live long enough to see their tumor recur. For more details, see the results of the Theon/Feldman study below. Should all Dogs with Pituitary Cushing’s Disease be Imaged to Potentially Catch the Tumor Early? This is a difficult question to answer; there are arguments either way. Imaging is not without risk since it involves general anesthesia and Cushing's disease patients are generally elderly. Further, imaging is expensive and there is only a 10 to 20 percent chance of finding a tumor big enough to warrant therapy. By the time it has been determined that a dog has Cushing's disease, many owners are tired of the seemingly endless progression of testing and associated expense. On the other hand, imaging early will identify dogs at risk for the development of a macrotumor. For example, a dog with a small tumor (less than 4 mm in diameter) at the time of Cushing's diagnosis is unlikely to live long enough for that tumor to quadruple in size to a tumor large enough to warrant attention. A dog with a larger tumor (say, 7 mm in diameter) could easily have a tumor of significant size in a year or two and such a patient should be re-imaged in 12 to 16 months to re-evaluate the tumor size. A tumor 10 mm in diameter at the time of the diagnosis of Cushing's disease is probably large enough to warrant radiotherapy right off the bat even if no signs are yet seen. If this last patient is not imaged at the beginning, it is likely that the tumor will not be treatable when it is big enough to create more obvious symptoms. A dog with an initial tumor size greater than 10 mm in diameter has a 66 percent chance of developing clinical signs directly attributable to the macro tumor. At this time, universities recommend brain imaging on all dogswith pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease if possible.UC Davis recommends that any tumor 8 mm in diameter or larger be irradiatedand that smaller masses be re-imaged in 12 to 14 months. Results of the Theon/Feldman Study (Theon, A.P. and Feldman E.C. Megavoltage irradiation of pituitary macrotumors in dogs with neurologic signs. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol 213, No 2, July 15, 1998.) Overall survival was increased in macrotumor patients with radiotherapy. The average survival time was approximately five months from the time neurologic problems had started (patients without neurologic problems were not included in this study). Out of 24 dogs in the study, seven survived longer than one year from the time of tumor diagnosis. If neurologic problems were categorized as severe (i.e. there was a compromised ability to walk), survival time wasnotimproved by radiotherapy. Milder neurologic deficits were associated with longer survival. In this study, both dogs with ACTH-secreting tumors (the kind that cause Cushing’s disease) and pituitary tumors that were hormonally inactive (the kind that do not cause Cushing’s disease) were studied. The dogs with ACTH-secreting tumors had better responses to radiotherapy than those with inactive tumors; however, in these patients, radiotherapy yielded a better chance of resolving neurologic problems than it did in resolving the symptoms of Cushing's disease.

Category: Seizure Disorders in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Watching your dog experience a seizure is both frightening and disturbing, especially if it is unexpected. There is collapse, involuntary movement, and often loss of consciousness followed by a period of daze and disorientation. Prolonged seizure activity constitutes an emergency. You are presumably reading this because your dog has had some kind of involuntary fit and you want to understand what it means and what can be done to prevent future episodes so let's cover some basics. What is a Seizure and How Do You Recognize Them? A seizure results from excessive electrical activity in the cerebral cortex of the brain. The electrical activity starts in one area (called the seizure focus) and spreads in a process called kindling. Classically, the patient loses consciousness, collapses, becomes stiff at first, and then begins paddling or struggling but seizures can take many forms. Any involuntary behavior that occurs abnormally may represent a seizure. Seizures are classified into several categories. Generalized (Grand Mal) SeizuresThis is the most common form of seizure in small animals. The entire body is involved in stiffness and possibly stiffness/contraction cycles (tonic/clonic action). The animal loses consciousness and may urinate or defecate. Focal Seizures (Also Called Partial Motor Seizures)Focal seizures involve involuntary activity in only one body part. Consciousness may or may not be impaired. A classic example would be the "chewing gum" fit that frequently is seen in canine distemper infections but can be seen in other seizure disorders as well. Psychomotor SeizuresPsychomotor seizures are focal seizures where the seizure is more like an episode of abnormal behavior than an actual convulsion. The pet's consciousness is disturbed by this type of seizure as the pet appears to be hallucinating or in an altered state. The seizure may include episodes of rage or aggression where the pet does not recognize family members or may be as simple as a brief episode of disorientation or spacing out. Fly-biting is an example of a psychomotor seizure. Seizures (neurological events) are often difficult to tell from fainting spells (cardiovascular events). Classically, true seizures are preceded by an aura or special feeling associated with a coming seizure. As animals cannot speak, we usually do not notice any changes associated with the aura. The seizure is also typically followed by a post-ictal period during which the animal appears disoriented, even blind. This period may last only a few minutes or may last several hours. In contrast, fainting animals are usually up and normal within seconds of the spell, with no post-episode disorientation. Post-ictal disorientation is the hallmark of the seizure. Causes of Seizures and Diagnosing Them There are many potential causes of seizures: toxins, tumors, genetic diseases such as epilepsy, infections, and even scarring in the brain from past trauma. Seizures resulting from metabolic problems or toxicity (i.e. when the brain itself is normal) are called reactive seizures.  Seizures resulting from identifiable brain abnormalities are called structural seizures. Seizures for which no clear cause can be found are called primary seizures and the patient is said to have epilepsy. It turns out that dogs of certain age groups tend to have common causes for their seizures. This means that certain diagnostic tests are especially important in dogs of one age group while other tests are going to be more important for dogs in another age group. Here are some basic concepts concerning how age is an important consideration: Animals Less Than Six Months Old In this age group, seizures are usually caused by brain infections. For dogs, the most common infectious diseases would be caninedistemperor a parasitic infection such as withToxoplasmaorNeospora. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, obtained by a tap under anesthesia, would be important now that PCR technology is available for detecting the DNA of infectious organisms (like bacteria, fungi, or other organisms). Less invasive testing may be recommended depending on the infectious disease under suspicion. Animals Between Six Months and Six Years OldThe most common reason for a dog, particularly a purebred dog, to begin having seizures in this age range is genetic epilepsy (also called primary epilepsy). Epilepsy is diagnosed when no other cause of seizures can be found, there are no neurologic symptoms between seizure events, and the first seizure episodes begin in this age range. Usually basic blood work is done to rule out metabolic causes of seizures but more sophisticated and expensive testing (such as advanced brain imaging) is forgone as the presentation is fairly classic. Schnauzers, basset hounds, collies, and cocker spaniels have two to three times as much epilepsy as other breeds. Labrador retrievers and Golden retrievers are also predisposed to epilepsy but tend to begin their seizures relatively late, closer to age five. Animals More Than Five Years OldIn this group, seizures are usually caused by a tumor growing off the skull and pressing on the brain (meningiomawould be the most common tumor type). Consult your veterinarian about treatment options. Such tumors may be operable or can be treated with radiation if found early. A CT scan or MRI would be the next step. Referral is usually necessary for this type of imaging. For patients where surgery is not an option, corticosteroids may be used to reduce swelling in the brain. Treatment to suppress seizures may also be needed using one of the medications discussed below. When to Begin Treatment In 2016, the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine published a consensus statement on this very subject. If the dog fits into any of these criteria, medication to suppress seizures should be initiated: Treatment Choices: Medication There are currently four main medications that are used in suppressing seizures in dogs in the United States: phenobarbital, potassium bromide, levetiracetam, and zonisamide. If adequate control cannot be achieved with one medication, often two or even three are combined. The ideal first-line anti-convulsant medication is effective, reasonably priced, convenient to administer, and has limited side effects potential. Most dogs are started on either phenobarbital or potassium bromide but we will take a moment to review the pros and cons of all four of these medications. PhenobarbitalPhenobarbitalhas been the first-line therapy for canine seizure control for decades as it is effective, reasonably priced, and can be given twice daily which is relatively convenient. When dogs with seizures are started on phenobarbital, approximately 31 percent of them can be expected to become seizure-free. Approximately 80% of dogs on phenobarbital will experience a greater than 50% decrease in seizure frequency. Approximately 20-30% of dogs on phenobarbital will require a second anti-seizure medication to achieve acceptable seizure control. The downside is phenobarbital has the potential for side effects. Phenobarbital blood levels need to be periodically monitored as higher levels are associated with the development of liver disease. The phenobarbital dose must maintain the phenobarbital blood level within a safe therapeutic range and be adjusted accordingly. There is some expense associated with such testing. Side effects of the drug include sedation, which is usually temporary during the first one to two weeks of medication use and wanes as the patient's body adjusts. The patient is likely to be unusually hungry and thirsty on phenobarbital. These side effects can be objectionable. Some lab test changes are associated with phenobarbital usage and need to be recognized as such. Phenobarbital is removed from the body by the liver so good liver function is essential for phenobarbital use and phenobarbital can alter the metabolism of numerous other medications. Potassium BromidePotassium Bromidewas used for human seizure control nearly 100 years ago but was eclipsed by the development of phenobarbital. It turns out that while phenobarbital may be a superior seizure drug for people, potassium bromide may be superior for dogs. When dogs with seizures are started on potassium bromide, 52 percent of them can be expected to become seizure-free. Approximately, 70 percent will have a greater than 50 percent reduction in seizure frequency. Potassium bromide is associated withpancreatitisand probably should not be used in patients with a history of that disease. Potassium bromide takes many months to reach a stable blood level which could leave the patient vulnerable to seizures during that time. As with phenobarbital, there are monitoring tests associated with potassium bromide use and sedation is a side effect. Levetiracetam (Keppra®)Levetiracetamis popular for refractory epilepsy in dogs because it is fairly reliable and has minimal side effects potential. It appears to work best in combination with other seizure medications rather than as a sole therapy but many dogs do well with it as a single agent. There are no monitoring tests recommended for its use and an extended-release formula allows for twice-daily use. Zonisamide (Zonegran®)Zonisamideis a sulfa-class anti-seizure medication that is rapidly becoming a first-line treatment choice but might also be used to supplement more traditional therapies. Because it is a sulfa, it is vulnerable to the side effects associated with sulfa antibiotics: mostly tear production/dry eye issues but also some immune-mediated reactions. (Sulfa side effects are reviewed more completely in our pharmacy library under sulfa antibiotics such as trimethoprim sulfa). Zonisamide can be used twice a day in dogs but lasts long enough in the cat to possibly be used once daily. For more information about zonisamide,click here. Diet In 2017, a veterinary therapeutic diet designed to supplement anti-seizure medications was released. The diet uses medium-chain fatty acids as a fat source (fats come in short, medium, and long-chain types which relate to the length of their carbon chain) and it turns out that MCTs have a direct anti-seizure effect. Dogs that were not able to achieve full seizure control with medication were able to improve control or achieve total control after a three-month trial of this diet. It is not meant to replace medications by any means, just to give them a nutritional boost. Seizures at Home (When is it an Emergency?) A Single Breakthrough SeizureIt is a lucky pet that never has another seizure after beginning medications, but an occasional breakthrough seizure (as disturbing as it may be to watch) is rarely of serious concern. In most cases, one can simply give an extra dose of the oral anti-seizure medication that has been in use and consider the episode over with. The veterinarian should be appraised of the situation and the medication regimen evaluated to see if adjustments should be made to prevent further breakthrough seizures in the future. A Second Breakthrough Seizure Within 24 HoursIf asecond seizureoccurs within 24 hours, one might consider bringing the pet to the vet's office for a "seizure watch" (which means the pet can receive medication to interrupt any further seizures) as well as for re-evaluation of the current medication protocol. Since emergency care can be expensive, one might consider rectal administration ofdiazepam(Valium®) as a means of first aid and tiding your pet over until one's regular veterinarian is available. In anticipation of late-night seizing, request a set-up for rectal diazepam to keep on hand. The injectable product is delivered rectally with a special syringe that can be kept at home. The rectal route avoids any danger of being bitten while trying to administer medication. Recently compounding pharmacies have been able to produce diazepam rectal suppositories which may be easier to use than the syringe method, however, absorption rates are unknown with these products and most neurologists prefer using the injectable product. Rectal diazepam administration has been used successfully for many years in epileptic children; the technique has adapted well to veterinary patients. Diazepam can also be given nasally but there is a greater chance of being bitten. It is important not to put yourself in danger around a seizing pet. Involuntary jaw motion may bite you and in the period of post-ictal disorientation, the pet may not recognize you and may snap. As mentioned, an isolated seizure at home probably does not require more than staying out of the way and keeping the pet from hurting himself. That said, there are some emergencies: Either of these situations is called "status epilepticus" and are absolute EMERGENCY situations. See a veterinarian immediately! This is considered "cluster seizures" and warrants your pet being hospitalized and closely monitored for seizures. Can Seizure Medication be Discontinued Eventually? While there is some risk to discontinuing seizure medications, this may be appropriate for some patients. Dogs should be completely seizure-free for at least a year before contemplating stopping treatment. In breeds for which seizure control is difficult, it is probably best never to stop medication (German Shepherds, Siberian Huskies, Keeshonds, Golden Retriever, Irish Setter, St. Bernard). Phenobarbital is a medication that cannot be suddenly discontinued; if you are interested in discontinuing seizure medication, be sure to discuss this thoroughly with your veterinarian.

Category: Senility in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cognitive behavior issues include difficulties with spatial orientation (a sense of direction while moving around); problems with memory, learning, housetraining; and difficulty in recognizing and reacting to human family members. Pet owners have long been frustrated by age-related behavior changes, including house-training problems, apparent memory loss, disorientation, confusion, staring, wandering, getting stuck in corners, sleep disturbances (waking at the wrong time, sleeping unusually deeply, night pacing), restlessness, barking, separation anxiety, panting, drooling, obsessive licking, etc. Progression of clinical signs is so gradual that most owners fail to recognize the early stages. These changes are often written off as being due to normal aging. A recent study at the University of California-Davis School of Veterinary Medicine demonstrates how common these observations are: out of 69 dogs participating, 32% of the 11-year old dogs were affected by this syndrome and 100% of the dogs 16 years of age older were affected. In another study of 180 dogs aged 11-16 years, 28% of 11-12 year-old dogs and 68% of 15-16 year old dogs showed at least one sign consistent with cognitive dysfunction. Ten percent of 11-12 year old dogs had signs in two or more categories and this rose to 36% in the 15-16 year old group. Still, the high frequency with which the syndrome is seen in older dogs does not make the behavior normal. Increasing age results in some or all of the following changes in the brain: Treatments Treatments that may help improve cognitive dysfunction (CDS) include selegiline, dietary changes, SAM-e, environmental enrichment, and cerebral perfusion (an improved blood flow to brain cells). L-DeprenylAniprylL-Deprenyl helps prolong dopamine activity. This may account for part of its efficacy (power to be able to produce an effect) in treating cognitive dysfunction. In addition, since dopamine breakdown results in free radicals, L-Deprenyl also helps reduce the amount of free radicals in the brain. Of the 69 dogs mentioned in the above University of California-Davis study, approximately 76% showed improvement on L-Deprenyl after one month of therapy. Some dogs improved in the first few days or weeks; some dogs did not show improvement until the second month. Often dogs continued to improve during the first three months. Anecdotally, the earlier L-Deprenyl is started, the better the result. When using L-Deprenyl to treat cognitive dysfunction, if no improvement is seen after the first month, your veterinarian may recommend doubling the dose for an additional month before deciding the drug may not be useful in that individual pet. Dietary ChangesSome commercial therapeutic diets contain antioxidants, mitochondrial cofactors, and omega-3 fatty acids. These diets have been shown to improve the performance of a number of cognitive tasks when compared to older dogs on a non-supplemented diet. Improvements have been seen as early as to 2 to 8 weeks after therapy begins. SAM-eS-adenosylmethionineSAM-ewas found to be effective in improving clinical signs associated with CDS in a double-blinded, placebo controlled trial. Environmental EnrichmentJust because they're old doesn't mean your dogs can't learn new things. Use their intelligence to improve the quality of their lives. If your old dog's vision is still good, teach signals. This will serve as a back-up if hearing fails, which it often does. Signals are fun for dogs and are a more natural language for them than words. Grooming (touch) will help your dog cope with vision and hearing loss. Your touch will help guide your dog. In a laboratory study of older dogs over a 2-year period, environmental enrichment (e.g., housing with another dog, playing daily with toys) was shown to be effective tool for task learning. In fact, the combined effect of a special diet and enriched environment provided the greatest improvement in learning ability when compared to the dogs who did not have either dietary or environmental enrichment. Improved Cerebral PerfusionDrugs that increase cerebral perfusion may have some benefit in CDS. With proper care, senior dogs can be helped to manage the cognitive changes they will encounter.

Category: Syringomyelia in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Suh-ringo-my-eelia) Also called caudal occipital malformation syndrome, COMS, Chiari-like malformation, occipital dysplasia Syringomyelia is an odd word, and it does not exactly roll off the tongue on the first attempt. Furthermore, most of us never need to know what it means. Who needs to know what it means aside from doctors and those with a special interest in neurology? Probably anyone contemplating owning a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel should know what it means since it appears a large percentage of this breed has the condition. This condition is not limited to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, though numerous individuals of other breeds have been affected. Syringomyelia causes pain in the back of the neck as its hallmark sign but can also produce other neurologic deficits and weaknesses. It is a progressive condition. Neurology is a complicated science, but fortunately, one can understand this condition without specialized knowledge. Basically, syringomyelia involves small fluid pockets within the spinal cord and is caused by a mismatch between skull size and brain size. To understand how this leads to pain in the back of the neck, we'll review a little basic anatomy. The Central Nervous System The nervous system is divided into two parts: the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (nerves). The brain is located in a cavity in the skull where it is well-protected and bathed in cerebrospinal fluid. The spinal cord runs down a canal formed by our vertebrae (our backbones). It, too, is bathed in cerebrospinal fluid. The cerebrospinal fluid, lovingly referred to as CSF, provides nutrition, waste removal, lubrication, and shock insulation to our central nervous system. You might consider that the brain and spinal cord are almost like fish in an aquarium, and CSF is the water. CSF is formed in chambers inside the brain called ventricles. These chambers generate CSF, which then flows down a central channel (called the central canal) down the middle of the spinal cord, then outside and around the spinal cord and brain, and is eventually absorbed into the bloodstream. The blood-brain barrier separates the materials in the bloodstream so they are not secreted into the CSF. This is protective but also keeps many potentially helpful medicines out of the central nervous system. So, What is Syringomyelia? In syringomyelia, there is altered CSF flow due to an assortment of problems (congenital malformation, tumor, trauma, etc.). The altered flow leads to cavities of fluid forming in the spinal cord. This creates swelling and, ultimately, small pockets of fluid within the spinal cord, and since the cord is confined within a bony protective “cage,” there is no room for the swelling to expand. Pain results. Why is this Sometimes Called the Chiari Malformation? The Chiari malformation is by far the most common cause of syringomyelia, and because the two conditions frequently go together, it is not unusual to see the terms used interchangeably, though this is not technically correct. Dr. Hans von Chiariwas a pathologist who, in 1891, categorized different congenital malformations in human infants that generated the condition we now call syringomyelia. When human medical terms are applied to veterinary patients where anatomy is similar yet different, it is questionable whether the same terms are really appropriate. This is another reason why the trend in veterinary patients is towards the term Chiari-like malformation and away from Chiari malformation. A dog can have the Chiari malformation without syringomyelia. The Chiari malformation is the most common cause of syringomyelia but not the only cause. What is Happening in Syringomyelia? The driving force for creating the abnormal fluid pocket seems to be the beating of the heart and the pulse it generates. Each pulse generates a pressure wave in the CSF, displacing fluid from the brain and down into the spinal cord. This is how CSF normally accomplishes circulation, but in syringomyelia patients, there is some kind of obstruction to CSF flow (usually the Chiari-like malformation). This creates increased CSF pressure around the obstruction, and CSF can be pumped directly into the spinal cord tissue. This distends the cord, creating fluid pockets. The fluid is not CSF but simply what is called extracellular fluid. The distended cord exacerbates the obstruction of CSF flow, thus creating a progressive problem (i.e., a vicious cycle). Why is this a Back of the Neck Problem in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels? The brain is commonly thought of as one organ, just as the skull is often thought of as one bone. In fact, the brain has many parts, all very different, and the skull consists of many bones fused together. The occipital bone is the skull bone in the back of the head. It contains a depression known as the caudal fossa in which the cerebellum, pons, and medulla all take up space. In Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, the common cause of syringomyelia is an abnormal shape of the caudal fossa. Basically, the cerebellum is too big, and the caudal fossa is too small. This compresses the cerebellum, pons, and medulla, creating the obstruction that allows for syringomyelia to occur. In this case, the fluid pocket is just at the back of the neck. The abnormally shaped caudal fossa is the Chiari malformation. What Does Syringomyelia Mean for the Patient? In short, the fluid pocket in the spinal cord hurts. Certain postures, states of excitement or even weather conditions can make the situation worse or better. It would seem that the pain would be symmetrical behind the neck, but it is not. Scratching at the neck, chest, or shoulder without actually making contact with the skin and doing so only on one side is the most commonly reported observation. People with syringomyelia report headaches, neck pain, back pain, facial pain, or pain radiating down an extremity. The neck can develop a curve away from the lesion. Aside from pain, there may be other signs of spinal disease, such as weakness in the legs. Facial nerve paralysis (leading to loss of facial expression) is common in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with or without syringomyelia. Recent technological advances that made magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) more accessible to veterinary patients have shown that syringomyelia is not an uncommon problem in this breed, and it has been suggested that there may be a connection with facial nerve paralysis previously thought to be unexplainable.Seizure disordersare also common with this breed, so we do not know if there is an association with syringomyelia or if this is a coincidence. Most patients with caudal fossa overcrowding are diagnosed between the ages of six months and three years. Confirming Diagnosis/Ruling Out PSOM Diagnosis cannot be made without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This not only confirms that there is a fluid pocket but also helps determine the cause of the syringomyelia. There are other conditions that can cause neck pain: disk disease,granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME),disk infection, tumors, vertebral instability, and even ear or skin disease. One particular condition that might mimic syringomyelia is called primary secretory otitis media, or PSOM, and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is genetically predisposed to this condition, just as it is to syringomyelia. PSOM also causes neck scratching and/or facial nerve paralysis as well as head shaking, hearing loss, head tilt, or any combination of the above. PSOM is a condition that leads to the accumulation of thick mucous discharge in the middle ear and currently, the only treatment is periodic lancing of the eardrum and flushing out the mucus. The leading theory is that the conformation of the Cavalier's throat leads to abnormal fluid drainage through the auditory tube connecting the ear and throat. Obviously, it is important to distinguish syringomyelia from PSOM. If the dog has an obvious bulging ear drum (generally easily visible through a routine otoscope), this largely confirms PSOM; however, a good many dogs with PSOM do not have an obvious bulging ear drum. For these dogs, MRI should be able to distinguish these two conditions. Treatment: Surgery Probably the most effective way to address syringomyelia is through surgery to decompress the CSF flow obstruction. The earlier surgery is performed the better the results. The largest study to date looked at 16 dogs receiving surgery, and 81 percent experienced success. The problem is that scarring tends to lead to recurrence, and of these 16 dogs, only 45 percent were still judged as having good life quality two years after surgery. The fluid pockets eventually reform. Pain management medications, as described below, are almost always needed despite surgery. Simply draining the fluid pockets has not been meaningfully successful. Treatment: Drugs Obviously, surgery is invasive and expensive and may not create long-term results in a given patient. Given this information, many opt for medical management of syringomyelia, which means pain relief and using medication to reduce CSF pressure. There are three approaches to using medication: addressing pain, reducing CSF formation, and reducing swelling with corticosteroid hormones. Because of interactions and side effects, it is likely not practical to try all three approaches simultaneously. You can begin with a medication such asfurosemideand/oromeprazoleto reduce CSF production. Add a pain reliever such asgabapentin, which addresses neuropathic pain specifically, and possibly an anti-inflammatory pain reliever (NSAIDs). Dosing can be adjusted with the diuretic several times before deciding if it helps or not.Corticosteroidscan be added in, assuming the other medications are compatible with them, so as to find an effective regimen. Additionally, food bowls can be elevated, and the patient's collar can be changed to a harness to avoid pressure on the neck. Despite these efforts, 75 percent of patients will continue to deteriorate if surgery is not included in the treatment plan. If a combination of pain medication and diuretics is not helping, the pain medication can be replaced by a veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID). There are many options, and your veterinarian can guide you through the choices. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can be used with gabapentin but not with the NSAIDs. It is unclear exactly what the steroids do in this situation: reduce CSF production, reduce inflammation, simply blunt pain, or something else, but they are an additional combination that can be used.Long-term use of steroid hormones has important side effects to consider. Omeprazole, mentioned previously, has been helpful in treating syringomyelia, but its use is best restricted to 8 weeks in duration. Omeprazole is a strong stomach antacid that is also able to reduce CSF secretion. If the stomach does not require such a powerful antacid, it may be harmful to use one long-term in this way, but the spinal pain may be helped. Patients without Pain There are three reasons to screen an apparently normal Cavalier with an MRI: evaluation as a candidate for breeding, general evaluation, and monitoring of the individual. Whether or not you need to monitor an apparently normal individual is a controversial matter as MRI requires anesthesia and is, therefore, not entirely without risk. Dogs that are not experiencing pain do not need treatment. As for breeding, it is important not to breed affected individuals whether they are experiencing pain or not. This is problematic as some dogs do not develop their condition until later in life after they have already been bred. Still, the U.K. Cavalier clubs have developed a screening protocol involving screening MRIs. The U.S. clubs have thus far not adopted these guidelines but that does not mean they cannot be followed or adapted. Our understanding of this condition is still incomplete, and research is still active.

Category: Teeth Chattering in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Teeth chattering in dogs can be caused by several different things. Some veterinarians believe that the source of teeth chattering is usually dental or oral (mouth) pain until proven otherwise. An abscess, broken teeth, or gingivitis can cause pain; even some ulcerations or growths that don’t touch the teeth can cause chattering as a response to that pain. Dogs can also suffer from pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). A dog with arthritis around that joint or who has or has had a jaw fracture may chatter their teeth in response to that pain. Teeth can rub together if the jaw is clenched or from grinding the teeth. Imaging such as X-rays or computed tomography (CT) (both done under anesthesia) may be recommended to help your veterinarian better visualize what is happening in the jaws or mouth. Even though the most common cause is somewhere in the mouth, the source can be elsewhere, including the gastrointestinal tract, or involving a neurologic disease. In some greyhounds, and likely in some other breeds, it’s a relatively common sign of anxiety and often ends as the cause of anxiety ends, such as a veterinary appointment. Generally, the first step in treatment is a tooth-by-tooth exam under anesthesia with dental imaging, either X-rays or a CT scan. Tooth Resorption Tooth resorption is when the dentin, or the harder outside of a tooth, is inflamed and disintegrating. Teeth need to be evaluated closely for any tooth-resorbing lesions, as oral lesions may not be visible even on dental radiographs. Identifying tooth resorption can be difficult, and choosing which teeth to pull requires experience and judgment. You and your veterinarian should discuss whether referral to a veterinary dentist is in your pet’s best interest. Gastrointestinal Issues With some gastrointestinal issues, dogs may become nauseous, vomit, drool, or have gastroesophageal acid reflux. Lab work and imaging, such as ultrasound or endoscopy (a camera scope fed into the GI tract) or surgery, might be recommended. In cases caused by gastrointestinal issues, medications may help stop the chattering within the first week. Focal Seizures Focal seizures are sometimes a neurological cause of teeth chattering. A focal seizure is a type of seizure that only affects a certain area in one half of the brain, not both halves. A dog with focal seizures may chatter their teeth or display what may be referred to as “fly-biting behaviors,” where they snap at the air as if chasing an insect. However, unlike other causes of teeth chattering, a dog experiencing focal seizures will not respond to you as they normally would when you call them by name, make noise, or so on, and they may seem to stare off into space. Before this type of seizure, your dog may act unusual, such as walking back and forth or clinging to you. If your dog stops chattering their teeth during a short trial of anti-epileptic drugs, the cause of the chattering is likely related to the seizures. Other less common causes of teeth chattering exist, such as pain in other parts of the body or even hormonal changes. A physical examination and consultation with your trusted family veterinarian, along with appropriate testing, can help pinpoint the cause of chattering and help guide treatment. Additionally, taking videos for your veterinarian and listing all signs can be helpful to get them started on the best diagnostic path for your pet.

Category: Tetanus in Pets (Lock Jaw)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We have all heard of tetanus shots and have some sense that we are supposed to periodically get them, especially after exposure to some sort of dirty wound or bite. Some of us may even know that tetanus is sometimes referred to as lock jaw, but the general knowledge of tetanus generally does not extend much beyond that. Unless you work with livestock, you may not realize that tetanus is a concern for animals as well as for people.Tetanus is a disease caused by a toxin secreted by a bacterium known asClostridium tetani, one of many toxin-secretingClostridia. These bacteria are anaerobic, meaning that they grow in conditions where there is no oxygen (such as a deep bite wound or puncture).Clostridiaare soil bacteria, meaning that they live in dirt so it should be easy to see how a puncture contaminated with dirt would be a classical tetanus-yielding wound. Such wounds are particularly common on farms where there might be nails or bits of wire on the ground, ready to pierce a human or animal foot, but there is nothing special about rusted metal in predisposing to tetanus. The puncture can come from any pointed object. The pointy object provides the puncture (an anaerobic wound) and contamination with dirt provides theClostridia. A fight involving a bite wound and rolling around in dirt might similarly offer an opportunity for tetanus. Different animal species have different sensitivity to the tetanus toxin. Horses, humans, and livestock are more sensitive while cats are quite resistant and almost never get infected. We will be confining our discussion primarily to dogs. The Course of the Disease The tetanus toxin is called tetanospasmin. It is produced by the bacteriumClostridium tetaniin a wound. The toxin binds to local nerves and migrates up into the central nervous system where it interferes with the release of glycine and GABA, both of which are inhibitory neurotransmitters. The result of this loss of inhibition is painful muscle over-activity, spasms and rigidity. In severe cases, the patient cannot breathe because of the rigid paralysis of the respiratory muscles and a mechanical ventilator is required. As a human disease, tetanus has been known and described since ancient times. In the modern world, human death is unusual and is mostly limited to infants and to the elderly, but even in these groups mortality is only 10-15 percent. The incubation period of tetanus is 3 to 21 days, with 5 to 10 days from the original wound being more typical. Classically, the patient first loses the ability to blink and must flash the third eyelid to moisten the eye. The patient becomes sensitive to light and sound such that clapping one’s hands can actually create spasms or seizures. Dogs with ears that hang down may actually develop ears that stand up straight, and the facial muscles pull back in such a way as to create what is called the risus sardonicus or sardonic smile. In more advanced stages, the patient can no longer walk and stands stiffly in what is called a sawhorse stance. In an advanced state of disease, the patient cannot walk or even sit up and is at risk for aspiration of saliva or food contents. If the jaws are locked, feeding may be impossible and if the respiratory muscles become involved, the patient will not be able to effectively breathe. In dogs, a localized tetanus is more common than the generalized (whole body form) and only the limb nearest the original wound becomes rigid or will tremor. This is an easier form to treat compared to the more generalized; however, the localized form can spread and become the generalized form. In the generalized form, initial signs seem to pertain to the eyes and can easily be mistaken for eye disease in the early stages. Testing There is no test for tetanus in the way you might hope: no blood test or unique finding. The diagnosis is generally made based on the appearance of the animal and history of a wound. It is possible to measure antibody levels against the tetanus toxin but this has not been widely used in the clinical setting. Attempting to cultureClostridium tetanifrom the wound is generally not successful. Therapy The first step in treatment is antibiotics to kill theClostridia. Happily, unusual antibiotics are not needed: penicillin works quite well for this classical gram positive rod.Clindamycinandmetronidazoleare also felt to be effective. Improvement is usually obvious in the first week of treatment. Sedation is necessary to control the spasms and/or seizures.Acepromazineand chlorpromazine have been recommended to control the sensitivity to light and noise. The patient will need a darkened quiet room and may need his eyes covered to reduce stimulation. These medications can promote seizures in other sets of circumstances, but tetanus is the exception. Injectable pentobarbital,phenobarbital, propofol, methocarbamol,diazepam, or midazolam can be used to control the muscles stiffness. Patients for whom respiratory compromise is a concern (when the respiratory muscles are affected or if there is larynx spasm) may actually need days of general anesthesia, an endotracheal tube (tube in the windpipe to keep an airway open) or even a mechanical ventilator. The decision on whether or not to include tetanus antitoxin is more controversial. Antitoxin is an antibody solution (a blood product) generated by either a horse or human to bind and destroy the tetanus toxin. It cannot remove toxin already bound to the patient’s nerves but can inactivate new toxin not yet bound. Toxin that is already bound to nerves simply has to unbind in time on its own. There is a risk in using antitoxin because it is a blood product of another species and highly inflammatory to the immune system. Antitoxin can be given under the skin or in the muscle but can take up to 3 days to reach a therapeutic level this way. Giving it by IV is more rapid but also more dangerous in terms of inducing an anaphylactic reaction. Skin testing is commonly used to see how reactive the patient might be. It is potentially helpful in early stages of disease only. Tetanus toxoid is the tetanus shot most of us have had at one time or another. It is a vaccine against the tetanus toxin and it is part of a horse’s regular vaccination set, just as it is part of a human’s vaccination set. Because dogs and cats are much more resistant to tetanus than horses and humans, regular vaccination against tetanus is not recommended for them. Nursing care requires a darkened room with minimal stimulation even if the pet no longer requires hospitalization. Clenched jaws can be problematic for feeding so expect a liquid diet or slurry to be needed. Soft bedding to prevent bedsores is a must. Improvement is generally noted within the first week of therapy but complete recovery can easily take a month. Some Tetanus Statistics Most of the information in this article has been gleaned from a study by Burkittet alpublished in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in January 2007 where 35 cases of canine tetanus seen at the University of California Veterinary Teaching hospital were reviewed for analysis. Severity Classes For the purposes of the study mentioned above, cases were classified by the severity of their signs into four groups. It is important to realize that a dog’s initial classification could easily change (in this study 17 dogs that were normal or in Group I at the beginning of the study ended in Group III or IV). Group I The dog was able to walk but also demonstrated constricted pupils, risus sardonicus, erect ears, inability to open its jaws, sunken eyes, and/or sensitivity to light. Group II All of the above plus erect tail, sawhorse stance, difficulty swallowing, walking stiffly with difficulty. Group III All of the above plus muscle tremors or spasms, inability to walk, and seizures. Group IV All of the above plus any of the following: heart rate below 60 beats per minute, heart rate above 140 beats per minute, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, or respiratory arrest. Study Results Overall, of the 35 dogs included in the UC Davis study, 77 percent survived. All of the dogs that did not progress beyond the severity of Group II survived and 50% of the dogs in Groups III and IV survived. Dogs in these latter two groups required continuous care (intravenous fluids, sedation, nutritional support, etc.) In 27 percent of cases, the initial wound was afoxtail tractand an additional 50 percent of wounds were suspicious of foxtail tract. A foxtail, or grass awn, is a sharp plant tuft that easily gets caught in fur and migrates deep into a wound, ending up in an assortment of inopportune areas of the body. An important conclusion of this study was that the wound need not be a bite or traumatic puncture.

Category: Tick Paralysis in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Tick Paralysis? Tick paralysis (also known as tick bite paralysis, or tick toxicosis) is caused by neurotoxins secreted in saliva by certain species of female ticks. Neurotoxins are chemicals that damage nerve cells and can cause a wide array of symptoms, including paralysis (the loss of mobility and movement), due to nerve toxins in tick saliva. There are differences in ticks all over the world, and the health impacts they may have. In this article, we concentrate on tick paralysis information for species found in North America, Europe, and Australia. Regional and Tick Species Differences In North America,DermacentorandIxodes spp. are primarily involved. Tick paralysis exclusively affects dogs in North America. The disease has not been reported in domestic cats. In Australia,Ixodes holocyclus, Ixodes cornuatus, andIxodex hirstiare primarily involved in dog and cat cases. Female adults ofI. holocyclusare mainly responsible for tick paralysis in the eastern coastal region of Australia, although larvae or nymphs can trigger neurotoxicosis if they are present in large numbers.I. cornuatusis responsible for the disease mainly in south-eastern Australia and Tasmania. In Europe,Rhipicephalus sanguineusis responsible for most canine cases. Feline cases have not been reported in Europe. Clinical Signs of Tick Paralysis in North America Not all ticks produce the toxin and not all tick-infested animals develop paralysis. Signs usually occur five to nine days after tick attachment, and include: Clinical Signs of Tick Paralysis In Europe Signs of tick paralysis are similar to that of North American cases, and animals have symmetrical signs. Clinical Signs of Tick Paralysis In Australia Because the species of ticks are different, in Australia the neurologic signs observed in pets are more severe and rapidly progressive in affected animals.  Both dogs and cats can be affected, and paralysis of all legs can develop within hours. Other signs include: In one study, asymmetrical signs were observed in 8% of dogs withI. holocyclustick paralysis. In the asymmetrical cases, tick(s) were present on the same side as the neurologic problems. Paralysis of the respiratory muscles is more common than in North America and death can occur within one to two days if treatment is ineffective or inadequate. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, finding a tick on the body of the patient, and rapid resolution of clinical signs after removal of the tick. (Either manual removal or treatment with a quick-kill, anti-tick product.) Diseases that can be confused with tick paralysis and that will need to be ruled out by your veterinarian are acute polyradiculoneuritis (a disease that causes paralysis and sometimes facial and vocal weakness), botulism (another motor paralysis condition caused by eating the toxic bacteriaClostridium botulinum), andmyasthenia gravis(a crisis form of this disease, which means rapid onset of full body weakness, respiratory failure, and megaesophagus). Specific Therapies   Tick RemovalWhen tick paralysis is suspected, your veterinarian will examine your pet thoroughly for ticks. This may include whole-body clipping for long-haired dogs. All areas of the body will be checked, and all ticks found will be removed. Removal is the primary means of treatment. Your veterinarian may apply a medication to kill parasites (a parasiticide) on the skin/fur. However, it can take the parasiticide up to 48-72 hours to kill any remaining ticks present on your pet, and some may be younger, smaller, and difficult to see. Because it is sometimes difficult to remove all ticks in this situation, clinical signs may progress during this time. For tick paralysis in North America and Europe, removal/death of tick(s) and supportive care are frequently all that is required, because clinical signs improve rapidly after the tick stops feeding. In Australia, tick removal may work if clinical signs have not yet developed. If signs have already started, more treatment of the signs and/or antiserum will be required to control the toxicosis. Tick Antiserum Immunity to tick neurotoxins after being exposed in the past, or natural immunity. has been described in dogs that have survived tick paralysis; however, natural immunity doesn’t last long, and the animal can develop tick paralysis again after another tick bite. In Australia, tick antiserum (TAS, tick antivenom, tick antitoxin) from hyperimmune dogs may help in the treatment of tick paralysis. Controlled clinical studies are lacking, but there is strong evidence from users of TAS that commercially available TAS is beneficial when dealing with the Australian toxin. However, administration of TAS carries the risk of drug reactions, so your veterinarian will weigh the positives and negatives of the use of this antiserum. Supportive CareSupportive care is extremely important for paralyzed patients. Such care may include intravenous fluid therapy, physiotherapy, urinary bladder management, and hand feeding with the animal in a sternal (laying on the belly) or vertical position (sitting on the bottom, sometimes in a specialized chair) for dogs that have developed megaesophagus. In addition, a feeding tube may be considered. If there is lung damage, antibiotics may be necessary. If there are eye problems, eye lubricants may be needed. Respiratory failure is a major complication of tick paralysis, especially fromI. holocyclus, so oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation, where a tube is placed into the lungs and attached to a ventilation machine to assist with breathing, may be required. Prognosis In North America, the prognosis for tick paralysis due toDeramacenter variabilisorDeramacenter Andersoniiis good, provided all ticks on the patient are removed or killed and adequate nursing care is provided. Removing the tick(s) results in an improvement in signs within hours. Complete recovery usually occurs within one to three days. Occasionally, muscle weakness may persist for weeks, but most patients fully recover from this disease when treated appropriately. Death can occur in untreated dogs from paralysis of the respiratory muscles. In Australia, the prognosis for tick paralysis due toIxodes holcylusis guarded and recovery may be prolonged. In Australia, tick removal may suffice if clinical signs have not yet developed. Otherwise, the clinical signs will progress if appropriate medical treatment is not done. Dogs less than six months of age and small breed dogs are at significantly higher risk of death. Dogs with low oxygen levels have a better chance of survival if they receive mechanical ventilation than if they do not. Occasional cases of sudden death have been reported within a few weeks of recovery. Therefore, your veterinarian will recommend that your pet have a non-stressful, 2-week resting period after recovery. Preventing Tick Paralysis The best way to prevent tick paralysis is to usetick control products.Check pets daily and remove any ticks. Always see your veterinarian right away if you notice any concerning signs after a tick bite.

Category: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-Like Syndrome in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called Uveodermatologic Syndrome) True VKH syndrome is a human disease, well described for nearly a century. A similar disease in dogs has been described but since we do not know the relationship between the canine and human disease, we are hesitant to call the canine version VKH syndrome as well. Until we know what is really going on in dogs, we will leave it at VKH-LIKE syndrome or, more accurately, uveodermatologic syndrome. A syndrome is a collection of symptoms. In humans, VKH syndrome consists of the following: Affected people are typically of Mediterranean, Hispanic or Asian descent. There are numerous links for more information regardingthis condition in humans. The syndrome in dogs includes: Unlike the human disease, deafness or meningitis is not a feature. The most detrimental part of the syndrome is blindness. What Causes this Syndrome? Uveodermatologic syndrome is an immune-mediated disease where the body inappropriately attacks its own melanocytes (the pigment-producing cells). These cells seem most prevalent in the skin, retina, and uveal tract of the eye. It is speculated that the immune reaction is initially triggered by a virus though research is ongoing. How is the Diagnosis Made? The best way to confirm this diagnosis is by a skin biopsy (the lip is said to be the best location). Treatment, however, is focused on the eye disease as this has the most serious outcome ‒ blindness ‒ while skin disease is generally cosmetic. Uveitis is most literally inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye. The uveal tract consists of the iris (the colored portion), the ciliary body (the area inside from which the lens is suspended), and the choroid (the vascular coating of the inside). The treatment for uveitis due to a VKH-like syndrome is the same as for other causes of uveitis. Thanks to the Animal Ophthalmology Clinic, Ltd. for these pictures. See the completecase studyof Sheila. Treatment Uveitis, whether it is caused by VKH-like immune-mediated inflammation or something else, is treated by suppressing the inflammation. This means corticosteroids (such asprednisone) are taken orally as well as topically. VKH-like syndrome will require ongoing immune suppression to prevent blindness and sincelong-term steroid useis undesirable therapy often switches toazathioprine,cyclosporine, or some other stronger immunomodulating agent. Topical therapy is also necessary; steroid-containing eye drops or injections of steroids into the conjunctival membranes are commonly used.With aggressive treatment, some dogs are able to regain some vision but in general, vision cannot be preserved and a more realistic goal is to control the eye pain. Blind dogs still have a good quality of life as long as the pain is controlled. A 2018 study published in the JAVMA by Zarfoss et. al., reviewed 50 dogs with uveodermatologic syndrome. At the initial evaluation, 36% of dogs had glaucoma (increased eye pressure) and 57% were blind in both eyes. Some dogs were able to regain vision and 50% of subjects could see in at least one eye at the end of the study. Of the dogs that ultimately became blind in both eyes, blindness came on over 13.5 months (median). At least 10 eyes had to be removed in order to provide long-term comfort.

Category: Wobbler Syndrome in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English “Wobbler syndrome” is the common term used for the spinal disease cervical vertebral instability, (CVI). The name comes from the weak, uncoordinated gait dogs with the condition have, giving the appearance of “wobbling” as they move. What is it? Wobbler syndrome affects the neck and spine in dogs. Dogs with CVI experience compression of the spinal cord and the spinal nerve roots, causing either neck or back pain or both, and gait problems. A narrowing, or stenosis, of the spinal canal and spinal nerve passages in the neck may occur. Causes CVI is divided into two types. One type is associated with the gel-filled disks in the spine that act as a cushion between the vertebrae. If these disks degrade and rupture, it causes spinal compression and affects nerves and blood vessels. Doberman pinschers are most commonly affected with this type of CVI. In the second type, dogs may have a type of osteoarthritis caused by a misshaped vertebra, causing the spinal cord to be compressed. This type of CVI is suspected to be inherited and occurs more commonly in Great Danes and other large breed dogs. CVI has not been seen in cats. Symptoms and Diagnosis While the first signs of wobblers are often an abnormal gait, symptoms include neck pain and stiffness, lameness or stiffness in the dog’s front legs or shoulders, and difficulty standing or laying down. Your dog can have weakness in the front or hind legs and not want to move, leading eventually to muscle weakness and deterioration. The disease can become so severe as to cause partial or complete paralysis in all four legs. Your dog may have a chronic condition, seeming to have weakness or pain that gets worse over time, or the signs of CVI may come on suddenly. Your veterinarian will likely recommend radiographs or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). MRI is the preferred method for evaluating CVI because it identifies the site, severity, and nature of the compression. Treatment If symptoms of CVI are mild in your dog, reducing exercise is recommended. Using a harness instead of a collar puts less pressure on your dog’s neck. If overweight, reducing calories may be suggested. Your veterinarian may prescribe anti-inflammatory medications. In more severe cases, your veterinarian may recommend surgery to help stabilize your dog’s spine. Approximately 40-54% of dogs with CVI that don’t require surgery improve. With surgery, about 80% of dogs improve. With or without surgery, your veterinarian will monitor your dog’s progress and response to treatment.

Category: Copper Storage Disease in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is copper storage disease? Copper is an essential nutrient needed in small amounts by your pet’s body for energy production, antioxidant defense, connective tissue formation, and many other biological processes. Your pet gets trace amounts of copper through their diet and water. Copper is ingested by your dog, absorbed in the small intestine, transported to the blood stream, and eventually settles in the liver. It is stored in the liver until needed by other body tissues. The portion that is not absorbed in the small intestine is removed through feces (poop). A small amount of copper is an important nutrient for your dog’s body, but too much is toxic and damages the tissues. Copper storage disease is excessive amounts of copper accumulating in the liver due to the inability to get rid of it, or too much in the diet, or both. Who gets copper storage disease? This disease occurs in dogs and is uncommon in cats. Humans have a version called Wilson’s disease. Certain dog breeds are genetically predisposed or are suspected of being predisposed to it. The average age of diagnosis is 7 years old, but dogs as young as 2 have been diagnosed. Both female and male dogs can have this disease. Common breeds: Signs There is no specific sign of copper storage disease. Because there are no definitive signs, it is usually diagnosed while running bloodwork for other reasons. Diagnosis The bloodwork may show values that indicate liver damage, which occurs in copper storage disease. Blood clotting requires certain factors made by the liver. In some diseases that damage the liver these factors are reduced, causing a change in blood clotting (coagulation) tests. The only definite way to diagnose the disease is a biopsy of the liver tissue. Here are the ways copper storage disease can be diagnosed: Treatment There are two goals of copper storage disease treatment: remove the excess copper from your dog’s body, and prevent future excess copper consumption. Therapeutic copper-restricted diets decrease the amount of trace copper consumption. Your dog will need to be on this specialty diet lifelong. Chelating agents are medications that bind the excess copper in your pet’s system and help excrete it in the urine. In some cases, diet alone is sufficient to control signs, while others may need additional therapy with chelating agents. Your pet’s health will be monitored during treatment by rechecking bloodwork and liver biopsies and your veterinarian can help you decide which therapy is best. Left untreated, your dog’s liver function will be irreversibly damaged. Treating early and continuing with lifelong therapy has a good prognosis. Lifelong monitoring of your dog’s health by your veterinarian is important.

Category: Diabetic Dog Diet
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources By now, you know thatdiabetes mellitusis about a lack of insulin and a need to balance insulin given by injection with dietary nutrients, especially sugars, fats, and proteins. Regardless of the patient's species, there are some basic principles that hold true for the dietary management of diabetes mellitus. First, the obvious: the pet must like the food and reliably eat it. For most diabetic dogs, the excessive appetite typical of the disease ensures this but after regulation is achieved and appetite is more normal, it is important that the dog eats on a dependable schedule. Insulin is typically given only after the pet has eaten, so the food should taste good, and the pet should want to eat it. Second, the food must be of quality and quantity to maintain a good body condition so that the dog is able to build muscle and a healthy amount of body fat. Some diabetic dogs are very thin, while others are too fat. It is important to tailor the diet to the individual rather than to adhere to rigid dietary rules. The ultimate goal is to feed the dog two similar meals a day, approximately 12 hours apart, with less than 10% of the total nutrients for the day coming from treats. Insulin is given within an hour of eating each meal and this schedule should be maintained with as much regularity as possible. No diet type has emerged as being optimal for diabetic dogs. The basic idea is to feed the dog a food that will maintain a healthy weight. Most dogs will not need a diet change, but this may be a good time to re-evaluate your feeding strategy. Here are some considerations: Treats Basically, minimize them. The regulation of diabetes mellitus depends on the balance between the carbohydrates going in and the insulin allowing them to be stored. Many people like to offer the dog a treat after insulin injections or after blood sampling. This can add a surprising amount of calories, and it is important to realize that every treat works against the insulin injections you are giving. If treats are felt to be necessary it will be important to determine how many calories are being added to the daily intake this way and adjust the meal amount accordingly. Ideally, treats are small and low in carbohydrates. High-fiber vegetable bits usually work. Baby carrots should fit the bill. Similar vegetables are also good choices.   Fiber These large bowel bacteria break down this type of fiber to feed not only themselves but also to feed the animal's colon cells, improve bowel circulation, and generally contribute to bowel health. The problem is that this process leads to a higher post-meal sugar surge in the bloodstream, which is exactly what we do not want. Insoluble fibers, such as cellulose, bulk up the stool, which can stimulate the colon. Insoluble fiber is not digested by the colon bacteria and does not offer calories to the pet that has consumed it. This is helpful for weight loss programs, as the indigestible fiber contributes to a feeling of fullness without contributing calories. After a meal, the starches and sugars taken in with the food lead to a postprandial surge in blood sugar levels. Since the diabetic dog is dealing with runaway blood glucose levels 24 hours a day, meals, as necessary as they are, raise blood sugar even further. Our goal with dietary therapy is to blunt this effect. Insoluble fiber in the diet helps accomplish this by slowing the digestion and transit of the food in the gut. Too much insoluble fiber, however, will give the pet a false sense of being full and reduce appetite, which may not be what we want if the pet is underweight. So what are we looking for in a food? If the dog is overweight, we probably want a higher fiber diet (say greater than 15 percent of the dry matter as fiber) but for a more average dog, we want a moderate amount of fiber (5-15 percent of the dry matter). The fiber content noted in the guaranteed analysis will likely not specify if the fiber is soluble or insoluble; you will need to check the ingredient list to be sure. HOW TO CALCULATE FIBER CONTENT IN FOOD ON A DRY MATTER BASIS  To calculate the percentage of fiber in a diet on a dry matter basis, look for the “crude fiber” and the “moisture content” amounts on the guaranteed analysis on the food label. SAMPLE GUARANTEED ANALYSIS Crude Protein (min).......8%Crude Fat (min).........6%Crude Fiber (max).........1.0%Moisture (max).........78%  The moisture content is the amount of water in the food on an "as fed" basis expressed as a percent (what percent of the food you are feeding is actually just water). Take the moisture content and subtract from 100 to get the dry matter content of the food (the part of the food that is actually food and not water). For example, if the moisture content is 78% (typical canned food) then the dry matter is 22%. Now take the crude fiber value from the guaranteed analysis on the label and divide by the percent of dry matter. For example, crude fiber on the label is 1%, and moisture content is 78%. This means dry matter is 22% and 1 divided by 22 = 0.045 or 4.5%. Our hypothetical canned food is 1% fiber as fed but 4.5% on a dry matter basis. When comparing foods, always compare on a dry matter basis so as to compare "apples to apples". The above diet is way too low in fiber for an overweight dog and probably a little light on fiber for a dog of normal weight or thin dog. High Digestibility Diets: Probably not the Best Thing There are numerous diets on the market designed for dogs with sensitive stomachs. These foods typically are designed for easy digestion and absorption. While this is helpful to the dog with digestive issues, easy digestion and absorption amounts to higher blood glucose levels after eating. This is probably not the best thing for a diabetic dog. Similarly, soft moist foods are preserved and flavored with sugars. These, as you might guess, raise postprandial blood sugar readily and are poor choices. These diets are not as common as they once were and should not be confused with canned foods. Low Fat A common issue that accompanies diabetes mellitus is elevated triglycerides (fats) in the bloodstream. In humans, this is the doorway to vascular disease, cholesterol deposits, heart disease, and stroke. Dogs do not generally have to contend with these issues but dietary fat becomes more relevant if the dog is one of the 30% for whom pancreatitis is believed to have damaged the pancreas and led to diabetes in the first place. If pancreatitis is in play or if the patients circulating triglyceride level is high, then fat restriction is going to be a must. Further, L-carnitine supplementation may also be of benefit as this nutrient is helpful in fat transport and metabolism. Fat-restricted diets may not be a good idea for very thin diabetic dogs, however. Other Concepts As long as the diet is consistent, it is generally possible to work with it to achieve diabetic regulation. Here are some additional tips: Your veterinarian can help you choose the most appropriate food for your diabetic dog. There are several commercial diets made just for this purpose or you may elect to find one on your own. You can also contact a commercial pet nutrition service for further help.

Category: Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar) in Toy Breed Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The creation of different dog breeds represents centuries of selective breeding to create true lines of dogs all with similar desired characteristics. Somewhere in all this breeding and selection, toy breeds were deemed desirable and were hence developed. Some typical examples of these very small dogs are Chihuahua, Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, Toy Poodle, and Pomeranian. And, of course, there are many others. Consider that if these dogs are so tiny as adults how tiny they must be as newborn puppies. These itty bitty babies tend to cut their baby teeth in late and thus have trouble chewing kibbled foods. They also have difficulty maintaining body temperature which promotes listlessness as they get cold. Both these factors combine into reduced food intake and difficulty keeping up normal blood sugar levels. Low blood sugar, which is called hypoglycemia, creates even more listlessness. Because the brain cannot burn fat or protein and relies almost entirely on sugar, the potential result includes incoordination, loss of consciousness and even seizures. Before you Adopt When you look at these darling miniature puppies, think twice before you adopt. The toy breed puppy is frequently a high maintenance project. This is not a living stuffed animal; this is a live creature with a handicap, at least until he or she has grown up a bit. You may need to feed this animal 4-6 times daily. Soft puppy foods are often needed as these puppies may not be able to eat hard food. They need extra warmth and it is important that you make an appointment with your veterinarian for a well-baby check up promptly. Puppies of this size do not toleratefleas. They are simply too small to have any blood to give away to blood sucking parasites. They need to be adequately dewormed and checked over for any signs of infectious disease. Diarrhea is common for puppies but a very tiny puppy cannot withstand the dehydration that accompanies diarrhea. Pet store puppies are high risk for kennel cough and the pneumonia that sometimes accompanies it in severe cases.Parvovirusordistemperare particular disasters for puppies of this size. A young toy breed puppy is a project more so than any other type of puppy. If this is more than you bargained for, you may want to get an adult toy breed dog or older puppy or even another type of dog. Puppies should be at least 8 weeks old for adoption. Ten weeks is even better when it comes to micro-dogs like these. Preventing Problems So you already have a toy breed puppy. Remember how sensitive to problems these puppies are so if your puppy is coughing, has diarrhea, is vomiting, has appetite loss (especially appetite loss!) or seems listless, waste no time in seeing the vet. Be sure your puppy is eating and mentally engaged. If possible, look in your puppy’s mouth and see if there are any teeth. In particular, look for the molars and premolars along the sides of the mouth. These are teeth needed for chewing and they may come in late. This will not stop your puppy from lapping up soft food. Be sure the food you are using is soft enough and that your puppy will reliably eat it. Nutrical: A Handy Supplement This product is frequently provided by both veterinarians and breeders for use in toy breed puppies. It consists basically of a malt-flavored paste with sugar and vitamins. Some puppies will readily lap it off fingers and others will only take it if it is smeared on the roof of the mouth. If a puppy seems listless, the first thing to do is attempt feeding. If the puppy will not eat, a finger tip of Nutrical may make all the difference. What to Do if you Think your Puppy Is Hypoglycemic Potentially, hypoglycemia is an emergency. The puppy will be listless maybe even uncoordinated. If the puppy is conscious, start by offering delicious food that he or she will want to eat. This may be all you have to do to avert catastrophe if the puppy will accept the meal. If you have Nutrical® as described above, this would be a great time to use it. In an extreme case, the puppy will become cold, will lose consciousness and begin to have seizures. For first aid, a small amount of Karo syrup can be rubbed on the gums. (It will absorb through the gums; actual swallowing is not necessary). Beyond this and especially if the puppy does not fully regain its normal playful attitude, the puppy should be rushed to an animal hospital for treatment. In the hospital, the puppy will be warmed and a blood sugar level checked. If intravenous access is possible, dextrose will be infused directly into the blood stream. Response is generally rapid once sugar is supplied in this way and a sugar drip or regular sugar injections will be continued. But the puppy has to reliably eat before he can go home. Anticipate the need for 24 hour care and expect a few days of care. Complicating Factors Bacterial infectionBacteria can be tremendous consumers of glucose (blood sugar). For this reason, hypoglycemic puppies may be given antibiotics. Portosystemic (Liver) shuntThis is a problem for the Yorkshire terrier in particular. In this congenital malformation of the liver circulation, blood travels from the GI tract to the general circulation by-passing the liver. The liver does not develop properly and has abnormal function. One of the liver’s functions is to maintain the body’s blood sugar level. An abnormal liver leads to low blood sugar. This condition can frequently be cured with surgery. A liver function blood test is an easy way to rule this condition out as a complicating factor. Parasitism/Diarrhea/StressStress from any cause increases the body’s demand for sugar. This is why it is especially important to insure the general health of the toy breed puppy. When there are stressors, maintaining a healthy blood sugar level is all the more difficult. Sometimes there is more to hypoglycemia than just low blood sugar. While being extra small and extra young is enough to drop blood sugar, sometimes there is more to the story. When your puppy comes home again after a hypoglycemic episode, it is important to watch food intake and be aware of any changes in energy level. As the puppy gets bigger, risk factors diminish. Teeth get stronger, body fat stores develop, and the immune system matures. Eventually, hypoglycemia risks become minimal and the puppy can continue life as any other puppy, playing, chewing things up, and learning the behavior control necessary to be a good house pet.

Category: Tremoring or Shivering in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dogs are often brought in for tremoring or shivering episodes. The patient can be any age or any size. Tremors can involve only certain muscles or body areas or the entire dog. Finding the reason behind tremors is tricky as tremoring occurs for many reasons. The first step is to consider normal reasons for shivering. The patient is: Usually, these can be excluded from being a disease by providing a blanket or sweater, comforting the anxious patient, or rousing the sleeping patient. Elderly dogs with muscle atrophy tend to suffer muscle fatigue and muscles will shake when over-worked. This type of tremoring is often pretty easy to distinguish as the patient is elderly and the tremors begin when the patient has been standing longer than they would prefer. When a muscle becomes fatigued, tremoring helps release stored glycogen/glucose to permit continued muscle contraction. Tremoring generally stops when the muscle is allowed to relax and the patient rests. Mild shivers are rarely a significant symptom; it is the more violent involuntary tremors and twitches that indicate neuromuscular disease. Conditions When Only Certain Body Parts Tremor If only certain body parts tremor, there are some neuromuscular diseases to consider. Intention TremorsDiseases involving the cerebellum of the brain will lead to tremors when the patient directs his attention to a task. The patient may sit quietly without tremors, but if a bowl of food is put out, tremors of the neck and head erupt when the patient reaches for the food. This sort of tremoring generally goes way beyond what might be described as shivering or even twitching. A classic example of cerebellar intention tremors is seen in kittens born withcerebellar hypoplasia, a neurologic condition stemming from the mother becoming infected with or vaccinated forfeline distemperduring pregnancy. Cerebellar disease certainly does not have to be congenital. Any damage to the cerebellum (trauma, tumor, infection, etc.) can produce an intention tremor. An intention tremor is highly suggestive of disease in the cerebellum, though, and diagnostics should be pursued to uncover the nature of that disease. See a video of thesewobbly kittens. Idiopathic Head TremorsNo one really knows why this occurs but some dogs have episodes of head bobbing (usually up and down but can be side to side). Breeds that seem over-represented are Boxers, English bulldogs, beagles, and Doberman pinschers. This condition is totally unresponsive to seizure medications and the best way to curtail an episode seems to be to focus the dog’s attention on a toy or treat. Episodes tend to get milder with age. See thisboxer's head tremors. Distemper MyoclonusDogs that survive acanine distemperinfection may suffer from seizures, paralysis, or muscle twitching long term. Often a young dog is adopted from the shelter or rescue, and her history is unknown. Distemper myoclonus appears as involuntary twitches of muscle groups anywhere on the body. Multiple areas can be involved. These twitches are not seizures and do not respond to seizure medications. Numerous medications have been used with inconsistent results. The most successful treatment has involved injections of cosmetic Botox® into the muscle group involved, but this therapy is expensive and many dogs do not seem particularly inconvenienced by their myoclonus. In thisvideo, the black dog is showing myoclonus of his jaw and neck muscles. Orthostatic Tremors This condition is observed only when the dog is standing and involves tremors of the leg muscles. The patient is typically a young, very large-breed dog (Great Dane, mastiff, Weimaraner). The condition tends to progress in severity over time and may come to require treatment. It is generally responsive tophenobarbitaland/or togabapentin. Conditions When the Whole Body Tremors If the entire dog is shivering and shaking, then we must consider diseases that involve the entire dog. Normal muscles rely on oxygen, nutrients, and electrolytes from the bloodstream as well as normal electrical stimulation from the nervous system. We need to look at problems with these systems: Severe tremors can elevate the body temperature dangerously and cause brain damage. Patients for which tremoring is an emergency are generally clearly mentally distressed by the involuntary motions or disoriented from the underlying neurologic disease. Many toxins can cause twitches and involuntary muscle tremors, so it is important to let your veterinarian know what products are in your home. What flea products do you use? Do you have pesticides in the garden? These products are frequently neurotoxins that produce seizures and twitching. Snail baits containingmetaldehydeare particularly common, as are permethrin-based flea products (generally safe for dogs but cats are uniquely sensitive). Tremors are a notable feature ofchocolate toxicity. Obviously,poisoning is an emergencyso you will need to see your veterinarian or local emergency service right away. TheAnimal Poison Control Centeris a 24-hour service run by the ASPCA. Consultations with veterinary toxicologists are $95 and are available around the clock in the event of an emergency. It is a good idea to keep their phone number handy. 888-426-4435  HomeAgainoffers 24-7 Medical Hotline access included in premium memberships with a HomeAgain microchip ID. In this case, the phone number is:  888-HOMEAGAIN then follow the prompts to connect. Brain diseases can produce seizures that can manifest as persistent but fine tremoring or more violent convulsions. Metabolic diseases, such as low blood sugar or low blood calcium, can lead to tremors and even seizures. Muscle diseases such astetanuscan lead to involuntary muscle contraction. Twitches and tremors may be intermittent and are certainly not always emergencies; however, blood testing and possibly advanced neurological testing may be needed. Your first step is going to be an evaluation with your veterinarian to narrow down the search and complete the necessary basic tests. Not all veterinarians are comfortable diagnosing neurologic disease, so discuss with your veterinarian whether referral to a specialist would be best for you and your pet. The best treatment plan can be made from there. The small white dog in this video hasWhite Shaker syndrome. It is generally controlled with immune-suppressive doses of corticosteroids. The prognosis (outlook) is generally good.

Category: Amputation is Preferable to Continued Pain
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dear Friend: I've decided to sit down and put pen to paper on behalf of your veterinarian and indeed, all veterinarians in small animal practice. If you've found your way to this article, it's very likely that your veterinarian has advised you to consider amputation of one of your pet's limbs. There may be many reasons for such a recommendation including irreparable trauma, cancer, or even severe arthritic pain. Amputation is obviously a drastic step and one that you need to carefully consider, sometimes even to the point of soliciting a second opinion. Your veterinarian and I urge you to take whatever steps you feel are necessary in carefully considering such a decision. The reason for this friendly letter is that those of us in the veterinary profession see too many owners who reject the option of amputation out of hand. While contemplating amputation in a pet can be a very emotional situation, very many owners see continued pain or even euthanasia as better options than amputation and this has us veterinarians scratching our heads! First, let me assure you, as your veterinarian probably already has, that animal amputees do extremely well. In fact, most are just as mobile after surgery as they ever were. Every veterinarian has stories of animal amputees who resume their jobs as herding or hunting dogs or accompany their owners jogging every morning! We've all seen cat amputees where casual observers of the animals don't even realize that the cat is missing a limb! There are even stories of double-amputee animals who function well on two legs! In light of this knowledge, it's very hard for us veterinarians to understand how a client would prefer suffering or death for their pet to an amputation. Does this mean that everything is sweetness and light after an amputation? There's no doubt that amputees have to recover from the surgery and may take a few days to learn to balance on their three legs although a great many have already had little use of the affected limb. There is also no doubt that a few patients, specifically very obese or giant breed dogs and animals with severe restrictions to the functioning of their other limbs, may have greater difficulty in adapting after amputation. If you're like most clients, despite the eloquence of my prose, you remain unconvinced. If so, there are a couple of things you can do so you can make an informed decision. Your veterinarian can likely provide you with the names and phone numbers of other clients who have gone through an amputation with their pets and would be happy to chat with you. You might also discuss with your veterinarian the option of a trial amputation! All that involves is bandaging the affected limb up against the body for a couple of days to see how your pet will function. Still not convinced? Here is a website that might be of interest fromCassie's Club, the Place for Three-Legged Dogs and the People who Love them. I hope this gives you a little more information upon which to base your decision. The key is that whatever you decide, you owe it to your pet to make an informed decision. Yours truly, Dr. Greg Harasen and your veterinarian!

Category: Bicipital Tendinopathy in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Sometimes dogs develop a foreleg lameness without any witnessed injury. Initially, you may note only stiffness or limping when rising or after heavy play. Over time, the limping becomes consistent. One of the possible reasons for these subtle changes progressing to a lameness is tendon damage, which can range from uncomfortable to painful. Tendons are connective tissue that attach muscle to bone and help the bones move. One tendon that dogs are likely to have problems with is the bicipital tendon, which attaches the bicep muscle to the shoulder blade and crosses through the shoulder joint. The bicipital tendon allows the shoulder to extend and the elbow to flex. While people and dogs sometimes have problems with this tendon, people don’t walk on their arms, so it’s an entirely different problem for dogs. Repetitive motion over time from running, jumping, and playing can lead to changes in the tendon, causing it to become tight and painful. In addition, an overweight dog will be putting more stress on the tendon. It is this repetitive trauma and/or overloading of the tendon that initially causes inflammation and tendon damage. The body will try to heal the tendon naturally; however, the lack of blood vessels at the origin of the tendon result in a response that is prolonged and lacks complete healing. This lack of complete healing can result in scar tissue forming, thus not allowing the tendon to work as well as it should. With bicipital tendinopathies, pain and lameness increase with exercise and improve with rest. It gets worse after vigorous exercise. The condition is seen most often in medium- to large-breed dogs of most ages, and in athletic dogs (agility participants, racing and lure coursing dogs), and often in dogs who jump a lot, either over hurdles in flyball and agility or on and off the couch. Sometimes it is seen in small breed dogs too. However, it’s most common in out-of-shape dogs, those weekend warriors who sit all week and overdo on weekends. There are also some underlying diseases that can cause it, such as such as osteochondritis dissecans, medial shoulder syndrome, or developmental elbow disease. Diagnosis If the dog has a history of a subtle lameness of the front limb when rising or after play/exercise, an orthopedic examination is the first step. The shoulder will need to be localized as the source of discomfort. Your veterinarian will perform various manipulations to see if there is pain associated with the biceps tendon. Following an orthopedic examination, radiographs are the next step. A radiograph does a great job of giving us bony information to rule out many things; however, since the biceps is a soft tissue structure, unless it is calcified it can’t be seen on a radiograph. To truly diagnose a biceps tendinopathy, an ultrasound is used and in some cases magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be called for. Treatment Initially for an acute lameness or a first-time offender, it can be managed medically with rest, exercise restrictions, andnonsteroidal anti-inflammatories(NSAIDs) or other pain medications. The timeframe for healing is typically around 4-6 weeks. In more severe cases or repeat offenders, a formal rehabilitation program and/or intra-articular injection of a steroid or biologic can be used. The timeframe for exercise restriction is going to vary between 8-12 weeks. That is a long, long time in which to walk the dog on leash to go potty, be restricted inside the house, and to forego all manner of squirrel chasing, playing, and running. However, that's what lessens the inflammation. If a dog is not restricted to rest during that time frame, the inflammation is almost certain to return, and the rest period will need to start from day one again. The addition of formal rehabilitation therapy will aid in tendon healing and allows your pet to be intellectually stimulated during the down time of exercise restriction. If the lameness does not go away after appropriate conservative management, surgery can be considered. The surgery aims to cut the tendon from its origin inside the shoulder joint (biceps release) to eliminate the discomfort that occurs from the tendon stretching across the joint. This surgery is commonly completed arthroscopically as this results in less tissue damage and a quicker return to function. Restricting activity and physical rehabilitation are still necessary after surgery, though. In most situations appropriate conservative management solutions result in a return to normal function. Unfortunately, because the tendon was damaged over a long period of time, the full recovery time is also prolonged. A full recovery takes approximately 4 to 6 months for a patient to go through the exercise restriction/rehabilitation phase as well as the return to activity/conditioning phases. Weight control after healing is critical as an increased body condition causes overloading of the joint, which is damaging. After the dog has healed, take care to avoid repetitive concussive activities and weight gain.

Category: Cervical IVDD (Intervertebral Disc Disease) in Dogs - Background and Signs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English IVDD/IVDH - Background Cervical intervertebral disc disease is just one possible diagnosis your veterinarian should consider when your dog appears to have a cervical spinal issue. While helpful, neck X-rays can be unreliable. If the patient is not sedated or is positioned incorrectly for the X-ray, false findings may appear, or actual issues might be missed. In these instances, proving or disproving a diagnosis is not always possible. Degeneration of IVDs can be invisible on standard X-rays, whether the disc remains in its proper location or has protruded or extruded. X-rays that appear “normal” don’t necessarily exclude the diagnosis of IVDH. Disc space narrowing (smaller space between adjacent vertebrae) seen on an X-ray of a dog with signs may suggest a disc herniation but can’t prove that disc herniation at that site is the cause. Dogs with signs of cervical IVDH may first have milder signs that still are unchanged or mild first signs that increasingly worsen, including progression to weakness or paralysis, or they may start out with more severe initial signs of weakness or paralysis. Signs and their progression depend on several factors, including the force with which the spinal cord is impacted, the amount of spinal cord and/or nerve root compression, and the degree of inflammation present. If your dog has signs of neck pain alone, your veterinarian may perform a neurologic exam to ensure there are no other issues that may have been missed. This exam will include watching how your dog walks and moves their head and neck and checking for muscle spasms, coordination, and reflexes in the limbs. X-rays may be ordered, but as said previously, X-rays may not be reliable. If your dog shows severe signs or signs that aren’t improving with medical treatment and rest, your veterinarian may refer you to a surgeon for evaluation. More severe signs are less likely to improve or may not improve quickly with non-surgical treatments alone. Your Dog’s Spine All mammals, including your dog, have spines made up of individual bones called vertebrae. The spine is divided into five areas: The Spinal Cord The spinal cord is the communication trunk for the body’s central nervous system, connecting the body with the brain. The spine acts as a bony tube that protects the spinal cord. To allow movement, joints, ligaments, muscles, and tendons connect the individual vertebrae. Between each vertebra (except the first two neck vertebrae) are cushiony wafers called intervertebral discs, or IVDs. These discs are made of a tough outer ring of fibrous tissue and an inner jelly-like material, serving as shock absorbers for the vertebra. Intervertebral Disc Disease IVDs are subject to several possible diseases, called intervertebral disc disease or IVDD. Health issues affecting the backbone commonly relate to aging and worsen over time. The soft inner material of the IVD loses its water content and becomes stiff and fibrous (fibroid degeneration). This process usually goes unnoticed because the discs have no sensory nerves. Less cushion between the discs creates more movement between the adjacent vertebral bones, which can produce bony spurs. These spurs may join and partially fuse the vertebrae. The spurs are not painful but can be seen on X-rays. IVDs, whether normal or undergoing degeneration, are, in general, invisible on X-rays. The other type of degeneration is called chondroid (cartilage-like) metaplasia, which is seen in dog breeds that resemble dwarfs with short, curvy limbs. This type of degeneration is genetic and begins early in life. Studies have shown that about 90% of dogs in these breeds will have evidence of this form of IVDD by the time they reach one to two years of age. With chondroid degeneration, the discs will undergo mineralization/calcification, meaning calcium builds up in tissues and hardens into mineral deposits. Mineralized discs can be seen on X-rays. Signs related to IVDD appear when the disc moves out of its standard location and presses against either the spinal cord or the nerve roots that come off the spinal cord. This kind of disc disease is more common with discs that already have some level of degeneration. In people, this is called a “slipped disc”. The medical term for this is disc herniation, or IVDH (intervertebral disc herniation). IVDH The three significant forms of disc herniation are: It is uncommon for simple IVD degeneration to result in IVDH (meaning most animals with IVDD, even if it can be seen on X-rays, won’t have any symptoms as a result); however, the chondrodystrophic breeds have a higher risk for IVDH as mentioned above. Signs of Cervical IVDH Pain is the most common and often the only sign of disc herniation in the neck. Your dog may be reluctant to: Most of these signs are due to nerve root compression from the herniated disc. Sometimes, with disc herniations in the mid and lower part of the neck, this nerve root compression may result in signs in the forelimb served by that nerve root. In people, this is reported as tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, pain, or weakness in an arm. Dogs may be seen limping or holding a forelimb up. Root Signature Dogs might limp, hold up a front leg, or lick a paw. This is called a “root signature”.  These signs may make you think there is a problem with the leg itself, such as joint, bone, or muscle pain. If issues with the front leg’s bones, joints, and muscles are ruled out, and especially if there is neck pain, a “root signature” may be the cause. Signs of Spinal Cord Injury Neurological deficits can result when the spinal cord is injured by compression from a herniated disc. Signs include paresis (weakness) and ataxia (incoordination). Your dog may trip or stumble, and their body may veer from side to side. Their limbs may cross over themselves, or they may have trouble getting up and walking. With a cervical disc herniation, the signs will affect all four limbs. The hind limbs may be more affected, or weakness may be more severe on one side than the other. In cases of severe weakness, your dog may be unable to walk without help or at all (paralysis). More severe neurologic issues may mean a poorer prognosis or a slower recovery.

Category: Cervical IVDD (Intervertebral Disc Disease) in Dogs - Diagnosis and Treatment
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Once your dog has been diagnosed with cervical intervertebral disc disease, your veterinarian will discuss treatment options with you. Advanced Diagnostic Imaging If your dog has been referred for possible surgery, the surgeon will review the history and prior treatments and examine your dog. After your dog’s evaluation has been completed and surgery is recommended as the next step, the surgeon will recommend advanced diagnostic imaging. Such imaging will help pinpoint the cause and location of the problem and guide the surgical treatment. There are several techniques used for advanced diagnostic imaging: Note that none of these imaging types are generally recommended unless there is an intention to pursue surgery for treatment since knowing the specific cause and location of a problem won’t alter the non-surgical options available. Conservative Treatment Treatment usually begins with non-surgical interventions in dogs where pain, or pain plus a root signature, is the only sign, and the presumption is that signs are due to IVDH. The key to successful conservative treatment is restricting your dog’s activity. Resting a herniated disc is like resting a sprain. In dogs, this means strict crate rest. Rest helps decrease inflammation and allows the body to heal the injury. Activity should be limited to bathroom breaks on a leash with no excessive movement. Crate rest will probably be recommended for at least two to four weeks, even if you see improvement in your dog before the end of the prescribed rest period. Along with limited activity, your veterinarian will likely prescribe one or more medications. These include analgesics (painkillers), anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids or non-steroidal medications), muscle relaxants, and sedatives. Because these drugs can help control symptoms but do not specifically treat the underlying cause, improving while on medication does not eliminate the need to continue crate rest for the prescribed period, especially as your dog begins to feel better and wants to move more. The finding of neurologic deficits and not just pain points to some degree of spinal cord involvement. If neurologic signs are mild, it may still be appropriate to follow a conservative course of treatment. However, your dog should be watched closely for evidence of a worsening condition, especially if they have been confined appropriately and has had medical treatment. Surgery is usually recommended if signs are more extreme (such as severe incoordination and weakness). Mild signs such as pain alone do not always relate to the amount of herniation by the disc or the degree of spinal cord compression. Dogs with only mild signs may have very large disc protrusions or extrusions. These dogs may not respond to conservative treatment or may relapse. If this is the case with your dog, your veterinarian may feel surgical referral is more appropriate. Surgical Management The choice to pursue surgery for IVDH is based on the severity and progression of signs, your dog’s past history (have there been previous bouts of similar signs?), and response (or lack thereof) to non-surgical treatments. A scale of the severity of the signs can be created, starting with neck pain alone and moving to paralysis. While there is no defined cut-off point for trying non-surgical treatment, it is generally true that the chances for recovery without surgery decrease the further down the scale, and surgery is usually recommended if a patient is non-ambulatory (unable to walk). Even milder signs may justify surgery if they do not resolve with appropriate medical treatment or relapse often. Surgical Procedures The goals and capabilities of surgery for IVDH are surprisingly quite limited and straightforward: To decompress (take the pressure off) the spinal cord and nerve roots. Surgery generally cannot “fix” any internal spinal cord injuries. It is hoped that the signs will be eliminated quickly with surgery and that better blood flow to the spinal cord will result in healing and recovery of lost functions in dogs with more severe signs. There are two basic approaches for neck surgery: The most common approach is to make an incision in the front of the throat and approach the spine from the bottom. This is less traumatic to the dog than you might think since muscles and organs in the neck can be retracted (moved away) rather than cut to reach the spine. Specialized cutting instruments are used to create a small slit-like window (called a ventral slot) through the bottom of the disc and the adjacent vertebrae (spinal bones), allowing the surgeon to remove the herniated disc without harming the spinal cord. The dorsal approach is through the back of the neck. This is done when the disc has herniated laterally (off to one side) or where the surgeon feels the more limited ventral slot approach will be inadequate for accomplishing decompression. The roof of each vertebra is called the “lamina,” and opening the bone here is termed a laminectomy or hemilaminectomy (just one side of the bony roof). Regardless of the surgical approach, decompression is only achieved once the surgeon removes the herniated disc and alleviates all spinal cord and nerve root deformities. Surgical Recovery and Prognosis Patients that have undergone spinal cord decompression surgery have a varying prognosis. Factors that influence outcome include the severity of the spinal cord injury, duration of the compression, completeness of the decompressive procedure, and severity of signs preceding surgery. Even with an MRI, the degree of internal spinal cord injury associated with disc herniation cannot be fully known. Spinal cord injury is estimated based on the severity of signs, but some dogs do much better than hoped, and others unfortunately less well than expected. The time needed for recovery also varies. Some dogs may show immediate improvement, while others may not show signs of recovery for two to three weeks post-surgery. Pain is often improved promptly after surgery due to the nerve roots' decompression. Usually, recovery in paralyzed dogs follows a standard pattern, depending on the severity of the injury. Once limb movement returns, bladder and bowel control are expected to follow. However, until then, and until it is decided that the dog can voluntarily control going to the bathroom, a critically important part of patient care is bladder management to ensure the bladder is being emptied regularly and frequently. This may initially require in-hospital management, but eventually, owners are taught how to meet this need at home. Many facilities offer formal physical/rehabilitation therapy staffed by veterinarians and nurses certified in these fields or physical therapists from the human field working under a veterinarian’s supervision. Patients recovering from spinal surgery may likely be referred to such a facility. While there may be core exercises for rehabilitating dogs after such surgery, programs are usually tailored to individual patient requirements and tolerance.

Category: Chondrodystrophy in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is chondrodystrophy? Chondrodystrophy is the abnormal development of cartilage. It causes the long bones of the body to grow at an abnormal rate and results in shortened legs. What is a chondrodystrophic breed? Chondrodystrophic breeds have the short leg, long body look. Classic examples include Dachshunds, Basset Hounds, Beagles, Corgis, English Bulldogs, and others. A chondrodystrophic dog can be a purebred or a mixed breed that inherited the short leg appearance. What is a different ‘normal’? To get the desired short legged look, certain degrees of limb deformities are selected for in these breeds. These deformities are changes in the shape or size of bones that are considered normal and expected in chondrodystrophic breeds but cause problems in other dogs. In chondrodystrophic dogs, one of the bones in the forelimb, the ulna, grows in an abnormal direction. This causes the other bone, the radius, to grow in a curved manner instead of straight. This curved bone contributes to the bow-legged appearance and is a normal finding as long as it does cause any problems for the dog. When the legs are not as straight as they should be, it is called an angular limb deformity. This can occur in any limb. It results in toes pointing outward to the sides (duck-toed) or pointing inward towards the body of the dog (pigeon-toed). The former is common in the front legs; the latter is common in the back legs. Either way, the toes do not point forward. This is a common finding in chondrodystrophic dogs. Another trait of chondrodystrophic breeds is misalignment of elbow bones. The bones of the elbow are meant to click into place like puzzle pieces; this does not happen in these dogs. Similar to other skeletal deformities, veterinarians don’t recommend fixing the elbow unless they cause problems for the dogs. Many dogs with this deformity move around fairly well. Are any diseases associated with chondrodystrophy? Many times deformities of chondrodystrophic dogs are excessive and cause enough problems walking that it’s a good idea to see a veterinarian. Some limb deformities lead to increased stress on nearby joints, resulting in joint instability, partial dislocation of bones (subluxation), pain, reduced range of motion, and lameness. The elbow joint is commonly affected but other joints are as well. Over time, these joints are more likely to develop arthritis. Chondrodystrophic breeds are predisposed to specific diseases and conditions. One such condition is an ununited anconeal process. The anconeal process is a small projection of bone on the ulna, one of the bones in the dog’s forelimb. An ununited anconeal process means this part of the bone did not unite or fuse; this contributes to elbow instability, pain, and lameness. Chondrodystrophic dogs are also predisposed to canineintervertebral disc disease,or IVDD. This disease also causes front limb problems and lameness but is an issue within the spinal column. Intervertebral discs are sponge-like cushions that sit between the bones in a dog’s spinal column. They provide flexibility and allow mobility of the spine during everyday movement. Chondrodystrophic breeds are associated with the premature deterioration of these discs causing disease. IVDD is a serious, expensive disease with high rates of mortality. In some cases, it can be painful enough to strongly consider euthanasia. As an owner, it is important to be aware of the risk of IVDD and other diseases of chondrodystrophic breeds; these risks should be considered before purchasing a pet. How do I treat my chondrodystrophic dog? Owning and caring for a chondrodystrophic dog is more about preparation and awareness than prevention and treatment. As mentioned earlier, many limb deformities do not need to be treated. To an extent, the limb deformities are necessary and desirable; they help create short stature. Chondrodystrophic dogs live well with deformities that cause pain and lameness in non-chondrodystrophic breeds. If your dog does show signs of discomfort or lameness seek veterinary care. In some cases, these symptoms are temporarygrowing pains; time will tell. In other cases, they indicate a severe deformity and need to be addressed. Treating these severe deformities involves medical management, exercise restriction, and possible surgical intervention. There is no current scientific evidence that chondrodystrophic dogs need to be restricted in jumping up and down, running or other movements to prevent IVDD. This disease is genetic and occurs regardless of activity. If you are set on owning a chondrodystrophic dog, educate yourself on the particular diseases your dog may get and consider creating a savings account and/or buying pet insurance; your dog may need expensive medical treatment at some point in their life. What about genetic testing? Recently, scientists have discovered mutations associated with a higher risk of IVDD in chondrodystrophic dogs. Some laboratories offer genetic testing. While this is one step closer to reducing an often fatal disease, more research is needed to determine how test results should influence owners and breeders. As an owner of a chondrodystrophic breed, tt may be more cost-effective to save for potential treatment than to spend on a genetic test. As a breeder of a chondrodystrophic breed, it is important to discuss this test with your veterinarian. Chondrodysplasia is an abnormal finding in some breeds and there is a genetic test available for breeders seeking to eliminate the trait from their breeding program.  Breeds like the Australian Shepherd, American Cocker Spaniel, and Chesapeake Bay Retriever are among those in which the condition is considered abnormal and undesirable.

Category: Elbow Dysplasia Causes Front Limb Lameness in Young Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Elbow dysplasia is the most common cause of lameness on a front leg in young dogs, especially of the larger breeds. Dysplasia refers to abnormal development, in this case of the elbow joint. The elbow is formed from where three bones meet: the humerus, which is the upper limb from shoulder to elbow; the ulna, from the elbow to the paw along the back of the limb; and the radius, which supports the major weight-bearing along the front of the lower limb.  All three of these bones need to grow and develop normally and at the same rate such that they fit perfectly together. If there are any abnormalities along these lines, or if the cartilage lining the elbow joint does not form properly, then dysplasia or an abnormal formation results. Elbow dysplasia can take several different forms.  They can be seen individually or combined. While all of the variations are distinct and probably develop in different ways, they all produce loose pieces of bone and/or cartilage within the joint that act as irritants, much as a pebble does in your shoe. These variations also are primary problems that invariably lead to arthritis in the elbow. The term arthritis simply describes inflammation within a joint. The longer time an elbow joint is ill-fitting or irregular, the more arthritis forms. While traumatic episodes may affect the elbow's development, the vast majority of elbow dysplasia cases are genetic in origin. Symptoms The first sign of a problem is a mild to moderate front leg lameness in a young dog between 4 to 10 months.  If the problem is not diagnosed at this stage, more lameness may be seen as severe arthritis sets in.  In the following list of commonly affected breeds, it’s mostly large breed dogs that suffer from elbow dysplasia. Diagnosis The history of front leg lameness in a young, large breed dog is suggestive of elbow dysplasia.  When examined, the elbow may show pain, thickening or swelling, and restricted movement.  Radiographs of the elbow will usually confirm the diagnosis. There are usually radiographic signs that suggest the diagnosis.  Advanced imaging studies, particularly computed tomography (CT scan), may be helpful.  Ultimately, surgery may be needed to provide a complete diagnosis.  In recent years, such exploration is most often done with an arthroscope, a camera that is inserted in the joint without the need of major open surgery. Treatment The use of an arthroscope provides the preferred means of diagnosis and treatment for many cases of elbow dysplasia.  Some cases may be managed with open joint surgery and still others may do well with medications alone, such as anti-inflammatories.  Early surgical management of these problems provides the best chance for minimizing arthritic changes in these elbows, but virtually all dysplastic elbows will develop some degree of arthritis.  Older dogs, where arthritis is well established, may still benefit to some degree from arthroscopic surgery but the benefits are less predictable. The newest generation of canine anti-inflammatory drugs, along with supplements and diets high in omega-3 fatty acids, may provide some relief.

Category: Elbow Hygromas in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The usual patient for this condition is a short-haired, large breed dog, usually an adolescent, brought to the veterinarian for a fluid-filled swelling at the point of one or both elbows. The swelling is generally non-painful but can be quite bulbous and bizarre looking. What has happened is relatively simple: the dog has most likely been resting on a fairly hard surface and the pressure of their weight has created tissue damage over the elbow bones. The area is not able to heal because of the repeated tissue damage from the dog simply resting on their elbows. A fluid pocket forms as the body attempts to create its own cushion. This fluid pocket is called a hygroma. The most common location for a hygroma is the elbow, though they can occur on the "sit bones" of the pelvis as well. The Uncomplicated Hygroma The simple or uncomplicated hygroma is not painful and is mostly of cosmetic concern. Changing the dog’s bedding generally solves the problem though sometimes elbow pads or bandages must be constructed or purchased. If the dog begins to lie on softer, more pliant materials, the hygroma is likely to simply resolve over two to three weeks as the inflammatory tissue is able to scar down. It is best not to tap off the fluid as any time the hygroma is pierced, infection can be introduced, potentially creating a complicated hygroma. Surgery on a hygroma should be avoided if possible for reasons described later on. Treatment for uncomplicated hygroma is basically changing the bedding or surface upon which the dog lies. The Complicated Hygroma If the hygroma becomes infected, it will become tender and surgical drainage becomes necessary. If the surface of the hygroma is not ulcerated, it can be drained and flushed. Rubber drains can be inserted into it to allow for further drainage into bandages. The bandages should be changed daily but it should resolve after a couple of weeks. If only drains are needed and no trimming is needed, the natural callus on the elbow will be preserved to protect the area; any surgery that disrupts the natural callus is asking for trouble. Any time a hygroma is lanced and opened, the potential exists for the area to be unable to heal. After all, the reason the hygroma formed in the first place is because the damaged soft tissue was unable to heal. The extensive motion of the elbow area also hampers healing. Establishing soft bedding is critical. If the hygroma is infected, there is no choice but to flush and drain it. Treatment for the infected but not ulcerated hygroma is placing asurgical drain in addition to changing bedding as above. If the hygroma is severely proliferative or chronically draining, or basically has a big sore on it, a more extensive surgery is needed. The callus is too far gone and must be removed. Skin flaps or even grafts may be needed to reconstruct the skin after the infected callus is removed. A splint will likely be needed to sufficiently pad and immobilize the leg during healing, which takes a month or so. As mentioned, the motion of the area works against healing, and removing the natural callus and elbow soft tissue is also an obstacle. It is important to recognize the hygroma early in its course so that it need not progress to a complicated status. If you are unsure about any swelling on a pet, see your veterinarian promptly. Other Hygromas Technically, a hygroma can form over any bony protuberance that repeatedly receives the patient's weight. The elbow is the most common area to form a hygroma but the "sit bones" of the pelvis is the second most likely area. These are called ischial hygromas and look like swellings under the tail right where the dog sits down. Again, softer bedding generally resolves the problem.

Category: Femoral Head and Neck Ostectomy in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The femoral head osteotomy (referred to as FHNO) is the hip surgery where the head and neck of the femur (thigh bone) are cut off and permanently removed. There are many reasons why a pet might benefit from removal of the femoral head and neck. Some typical reasons include: Ultimately, the goal of the femoral head and neck osteotomy (FHNO) surgery is to create a false hip joint that will be more comfortable and yield better mobility than the diseased joint the patient had before. Since results are generally so good with surgery, provided the patient is relatively small and/or relatively active, often simply removing the femoral head is the least invasive, least costly, and fastest route to a pain-free mobile hip. The Normal Hip Joint The hip joint is a ball and socket type joint that attaches the rear leg to the trunk of the body. The ball part is the head of the thigh bone (the uppermost long bone of the rear leg), called the femur, and the socket is the part of the pelvis known as the acetabulum. The femoral head is held in place by a thick ligament called the capital ligament, or simply the round ligament of the femoral head. Also keeping the bones in their proper location are the muscles of the hip; the upper rim of the acetabulum, which acts as a protective ledge, and the fact that the whole joint is enclosed in a fibrous capsule. When the femoral head is cut off, there is no more ball and socket, just basically an empty socket. The femur is kept in place by the leg muscles, and eventually, a fibrous connection forms what is called a “false joint” around the acetabulum and the area where the femoral head used to be. This fibrous false joint does not produce joint fluid and does not possess the normal cellular structures of a real joint, but it connects the bones together effectively. The Optimal Patient The FHNO surgery is best done on a smaller patient, about 45 pounds or less. This is because a false joint simply is not strong enough to readily support the weight of a large dog, and mobility would be compromised. On the other hand, lots of activity strengthens the muscles and builds a stronger false joint, so a very active, larger patient may end up with better mobility than a less active, smaller patient. Surgery As mentioned, surgery involves removing the femoral head under general anesthesia. Your pet will be in the hospital overnight on pain management medication and will go home when he has a good appetite and is mobile on three legs. It will take time before the pet is willing to bear weight on the leg, so he/she will be walking on three legs at first. There may or may not be visible stitches. Recovery can be expected to take approximately six weeks. The First Two Weeks after Surgery During this period, the tissues are healing from having been cut and manipulated during surgery. The focus is on pain management and rest. After the second day, apply warm (not lukewarm but very warm) compresses for 10 to 20 minutes are helpful to improve circulation to the area. This should be done two to six times daily. If the patient tolerates it, moving the hip forward and back (passive range of motion, or PROM) will help keep the muscles from becoming stiff or scarred. The entire leg should receive flexion/extension, as shown inthis video. Do not perform PROM if your dog is too painful. Try to keep the movements to a range that does not evoke pain. If you think your dog is in too much pain for any of this, notify your veterinarian so that the pain management regimen can be revised. The pet should be confined indoors to one room during this period with no running or jumping onto furniture. Dogs should be walked on a leash outside to go to the bathroom and right back in with no further walks outside. At the end of the first week, the foot should be touching down. After the First Two Weeks At this stage, the post-operative pain has largely resolved, and the goal is to strengthen muscle and prevent atrophy from disuse. The above exercises should be easily performed more definitively, plus other activities may be restarted: walking through water (better than swimming), walking (especially upstairs or uphill), and “dancing” (holding the pet up by his front legs and walking him on his hind legs). If the false joint forms too tightly, the pet will not regain normal range of motion, so exercise is important during this time. Healing is generally complete after six weeks. The recovery time may be prolonged if activity is limited by arthritis in any of the other legs, by the size/weight of the patient, or if there is scarring or atrophy of muscles from the initial condition that necessitated thefemoral head osteotomyin the first place. More formal rehabilitation programs (by a qualified animal physical therapist) can be designed for patients with these situations or who are behind schedule on their recovery for unknown reasons. If you have questions or concerns about your pet’s recovery, let your veterinarian know at once so that your pet can get back on track for normal mobility.

Category: Helping your Arthritic Dog
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many products may be helpful for dogs with weakness, especially rear leg weakness. These products may be available through your local pet supply store, various internet sources, or your regular veterinarian’s office. They may facilitate the lifestyle you and your dog enjoyed prior to arthritic limitations. If you think your pet might require more intensive aid, visit our page onParalyzed Dogs: How to Care for Themfor more information, including a discussion of carts and “doggie wheelchairs.” The products discussed here are examples and are not all-inclusive. Many companies make the same type of products for disabled dogs. We can’t vouch for any of these products or their companies, but if something seems like it may be helpful for your pet, please research it further or contact the company directly and find out for yourself. Shoes Slippery floors are trouble for the weak dog. Many a dog can exhaust himself trying to rise on a hardwood or tile floor. Rubber shoes for dogs have been used to protect the paws of performance and rescue dogs. They also help with negotiating slippery floors. Since the introduction of boots, other products have been introduced to support mobility on slippery floors such as paw friction pads and toe covers that help grip. Other items useful for slippery floors are rubber bathtub mats and yoga mats. These frequently provide the necessary friction for mobility. Handles and Special Leashes   Some dogs simply need help getting up and we don’t all have the strength to keep dog-lifting several times a day. Fortunately, special handle-harnesses or slings are available to assist in raising up the back or front of the patient, whichever end needs help. Raised Bowls When the food and water bowls are located on the floor, it may be hard for a dog to lean down to reach them. Your dog may not be able to steadily bend his elbows and knees slightly so as to reach the food without becoming weak and having to lie down. And then it may be all the more difficult to stand up again. Providing raised bowls allows your dog to maintain a standing position and be able to reach the food and water. Orthopedic Bed   Not all beds are created equal. Look for supportive, orthopedic foam beds rather than just a fluff-filled bed. Pet Ramp Consider getting a ramp for your dog to get in and out of vehicles. This may be more comfortable for you and your dog than trying to lift them in or out when they are no longer able to jump. If your dog spends time with you on the bed or couch, the ramp may be helpful for them as well.

Category: Hip Dysplasia in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hip dysplasia is a common condition of large breed dogs. Many dog owners have heard of it, but anyone owning a large breed dog or considering a large breed dog should become familiar with this condition. The larger the dog, the more likely the development of this problem becomes, particularly as the dog ages and loss of mobility/arthritis pain become important life quality issues. What is Hip Dysplasia? The term dysplasia means abnormal growth, thus hip dysplasia means abnormal growth or development of the hips. Hip dysplasia occurs during a puppy's growing phase, usually a large breed puppy, and essentially refers to a poor fit of the ball and socket nature of the hip. The normal hip consists of the femoral head, which is round like a ball and connects the femur to the pelvis; the acetabulum, which is the socket of the pelvis; and the fibrous joint capsule and lubricating fluid that make up the joint. The bones (femoral head and acetabulum) are coated with smooth cartilage so that motion is nearly frictionless and the bones glide smoothly across each other's surface. See more detail on the structures of thenormal joint. When a dog has hip dysplasia, the ball and socket do not fit smoothly. The socket is flattened and the ball is not held tightly in place, thus allowing for some slipping. This makes for an unstable joint and the body’s attempts to stabilize the joint only end up yielding arthritis. If this Disease Starts in Puppyhood why are most Affected Dogs Elderly? Actually, there are two sets of patients typically affected by hip dysplasia. The first affected group is adolescent dogs, typically six to 18 months of age. Image 2 in this article shows the hips of such a patient. This dog has hip dysplasia but has not yet developed arthritis. Note the shallow hip sockets. Dogs in this group are commonly brought in for signs of discomfort. Radiographs are then taken and hip dysplasia is discovered. Many young dogs with similar radiographs will not be in pain and thus will not end up coming in for an evaluation. As they age, they develop bony spurs along the margin of the socket, mineralization of the joint capsule, cartilage wear, and inflammatory change in the joint (i.e. degenerative arthritis) and become painful and now these dogs come to the veterinarian for an evaluation.Why Are There Differences in Age and Size for Patients with Hip Dysplasia? Obviously, different individuals may have different degrees of dysplasia. A dog's weight makes a difference (a lighter dog can more easily tolerate a more abnormal hip joint). The muscle mass supporting the joint is greater in a younger dog and helps reduce the stress directly on the bones. Still, some dogs have truly shocking radiographs and virtually no symptoms while others show relatively subtle changes and are very uncomfortable. It is not known why there is not a better correlation between radiographs and actual pain. How Can Owners Tell if Their Dog is Having Discomfort? Do not expect a dog with dysplasia (or any other chronically painful condition for that matter) to cry or whine in pain. Instead, discomfort is shown with reduced activity, and difficulty rising or lying down, or going upstairs. A characteristic swivel of the hips is seen from behind and classically stairs are taken in a bunny hop fashion. What Causes Hip Dysplasia? The primary cause of hip dysplasia is genetic but inheritance of this trait is not as simple as a dominance/recessive relationship like we study in high school biology. Normal dogs can breed and yield dysplastic offspring as the condition may skip generations. Furthermore, dogs with a genetic picture conducive to hip dysplasia still must contend with other factors such as level of exercise at an early age, nutritional factors, hormonal/neutering factors, and other environmental situations. Preventing hip dysplasia primarily focuses on breeding dogs with normal hips. The problem with this approach is that dogs often do not develop signs of hip dysplasia until well after they have been bred. A genetic test would be of great value in dog breeding, but currently, there is only such a test available for Labrador retrievers; identifying dogs with less than stellar hip quality so as to exclude them from breeding is done via OFA and PennHip certification (see sections on registration below). It is important to consider the breed of dog when choosing a puppy for many reasons, including potential genetic orthopedic problems. Hip dysplasia is typically a problem for large, stocky dog breeds. Small dogs and lean, slender breeds such as sighthounds rarely develop hip dysplasia. If you have settled on a breed that has an issue with hip dysplasia, be aware of the certification process of the parents. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals publishesstatistics on affected breeds. Other than selective breeding, it is possible to manage other factors in hip dysplasia development when raising a predisposed puppy that may help make the genetic issues less severe. Nutrition Nutritional factors are important in developing hip dysplasia. For example, it has been popular to try to nutritionally push a large breed puppy to grow faster or larger by providing extra protein, more calcium, or even just extra food. Practices such as these have been disastrous, leading to bones and muscles growing at different rates and creating assorted joint diseases of which hip dysplasia is one. One study showed that when puppies of hip dysplasia-prone breeds were allowed to free feed, two-thirds went on to develop hip dysplasia while only one-third developed it when the same diet was fed in meals. Another study showed German Shepherds were nearly twice as likely to develop hip dysplasia if their adult weights were above average. Studies such as these have led to puppy foods designed for large-breed puppies, where the optimal nutritional plane is lower than for small-breed puppies. After puppyhood, maintaining a lean body condition seems to be helpful in lessening arthritis signs. Exercise Exactly what the proper preventive exercise regimen might be is yet undefined. One study showed that puppies had an increased risk for hip dysplasia if they were allowed to freely run up and down stairs before age three months. The decreased risk was found in puppies allowed off-leash exercise, such as in the backyard, before age three months. Neutering Age There is some controversy about the effect of spaying/neutering before puberty. Male dogs rely on testosterone to stop bone growth and early neutered males will grow taller as their bones grow for a longer period if testosterone is removed early. This may lead to a predisposing disparity in the growth of bone and muscle. There appear to be predisposing factors for early spay as well, assuming the dog has the genetic predisposition.  How much added predisposition comes with early spay/neuter and for which breeds remains controversial. In one study, it was found that neutering before age 5.5 months was associated with a 6.7% incidence of hip dysplasia while neutering after age 5.5 months was associated with a 4.7% incidence of hip dysplasia. How Can I Find Out if My Dog Has Hip Dysplasia? There are two reasons to pursue testing: to explain a dog's discomfort/rear weakness or to screen a dog for breeding purposes. If a dog is not going to be bred and is not in any apparent discomfort, there may be no benefit to looking at the conformation of the bones in a radiograph except possibly to look back at a future time to get a sense for the progression of bony changes. The first step in diagnosis is an examination. Your veterinarian will likely extend the dog's hind leg backward to check for pain as hip dysplasia causes pain on hip extension. The dog may be asked to walk around to demonstrate the possible hip swivel. Another test involves having the dog lie on its back with a hind leg perpendicular to the body. As the leg is moved away from perpendicular to the body, a dysplastic hip will generate a pop as the femoral head slips to the center of the acetabulum. This pop, which can be felt if your hand is resting on the hip during the exercise, is called an Ortolani sign. You may hear this term used as hip dysplasia is discussed. The true confirmation of hip dysplasia comes with radiography. The dog must be radiographed on their back with both legs positioned straight down. This posture is painful to a dog with dysplasia so to get maximum cooperation from and comfort for the patient, sedation is needed. The seating of the femoral heads in the acetabular sockets is examined and assessed for arthritis. Above are two radiographs: normal hips in Image 1 and dysplastic hips in Image 2 (and severely dysplastic hips in Image 3). It is easy to see how the femoral heads are not well seated in their sockets in the dysplastic hips. This puppy in the above left has a subluxation, which means the hips are nearly out of the socket completely. Over time, the femoral heads will flatten and the sockets will become even more shallow. Bone spurs will develop around the joint capsule as the body attempts to stabilize the abnormal joint. What is OFA Registration? When purchasing a puppy, particularly one of a larger breed, often the parents will be listed as “OFA Good” or “OFA Excellent.” What this means is that the breeder has had the hips of the parent dogs certified by theOrthopedic Foundation for Animals. The OFA is an organization with the goal of reducing the incidence of hip dysplasia (though now it is also possible to obtain certification for elbows, thyroid function, and other issues). The idea here is that a dog for breeding can have radiographs taken at the age of 24 months. The radiographs are sent to the OFA for review by several independent radiologists where they are graded. Hips that are rated as “good” or “excellent” receive a registration number. Offspring of OFA-certified parents would be less likely to develop dysplasia themselves, however, it is important to realize that a dog with excellent hips at age 2 may not have such excellent hips at age 5, 7, or 10. OFA certification is no guarantee that a dog will not develop hip dysplasia symptoms in the future and does not guarantee that the offspring will not develop hip dysplasia but, as mentioned, until a DNA test for hip dysplasia is developed parental certification is the best we can do. What is PennHip Registration? Many people with potential breeding dogs do not want to have to wait two years for OFA registration. The University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Plan, developed by Dr. Gail Smith, allows for another way to predict if a dog will develop hip dysplasia. ForPennHip certification, the veterinarian taking the radiographs must receive specific training and special equipment is necessary. The pet is anesthetized and two radiographs are taken: one with the femoral heads compressed (pushed into the acetabula as far as they will go) and one with the femoral heads distracted (pulled out of the acetabula as far as they will go). A measurement called a distraction index is calculated from these radiographs,  the idea being that a tighter-fitting hip - one allowing less distraction - is less likely to develop dysplasia. Each dog breed has a different range of distraction that is considered acceptable. Puppies can be certified as young as 16 weeks of age with this system. Is Surgery the Best Treatment for Hip Dysplasia? There are many surgical options for hip dysplasia and it is important to understand which patients benefit from which surgery. Some surgical procedures are controversial and some are not. All will entail a recovery period as well as expenses. Both hips need not necessarily be treated surgically; treating one hip is often enough to yield good results. Hip surgery is relatively expensive and a surgery specialist may be required, depending on the procedure. If you are considering surgery for your dog, these are the procedures to know about. Femoral Head/Neck Ostectomy This surgery is commonly referred to as theFemoral Head/Neck Ostectomy(FHO)and is best used for smaller dogs (50 lbs/22.7kg or less) or very active dogs. Here, the femoral head is cut off and removed, allowing the joint to heal as a false joint (just a capsule connecting the two bones but no actual bone-to-bone contact). If the dog is not carrying too much weight, a false joint is strong enough. If the dog is very active, a false joint will form quickly. The pet typically does not want to use the leg for the first two weeks but should at least be partially using the leg after four to six weeks. The leg should be used nearly normally after a couple of months. Many veterinarians are well experienced with this surgery and often a specialist is not needed. This surgery is typically substantially less expensive than the other procedures. Triple Pelvic Osteotomy This surgery is appropriate for young (8-18 months) dogs with dysplasia but without degenerative arthritis changes. This means that there is a window of opportunity for this surgery and if the dog develops arthritis or becomes too old, it will be too late to do this surgery. Here, the ill-fitting acetabulum is essentially sawed free of the rest of the pelvis, re-positioned for a tighter fit on the femoral head, and then plated back into place. Many times surgery on one hip leads to positive changes in the other hip so surgery on the second hip is not necessary. Alternatively, it is possible to do the TPO on both hips if it seems clear that ultimately both will need surgical correction. Many general practitioners will not feel comfortable doing this procedure, so discuss with your veterinarian whether a referral to a board-certified surgeon or a surgeon with extensive orthopedic experience is in your pet's best interest. Aftercare involves a good three to four months of exercise restriction. No leashed walks, except to go outside for elimination, for two months. The biggest problem with the TPO is determining whether the patient really needs it. If the dog is not experiencing hip discomfort at the time of diagnosis, he may not experience hip discomfort until he is elderly, and should he really have an invasive procedure early as a preventive? On the other hand, if he is having discomfort at a young age, the arthritis is likely to only get worse and early surgery could help this tremendously. These are matters to discuss with the surgeon. Total Hip Replacement This procedure is for dogs with established degenerative hip changes. For these dogs, the best choice may be to simply replace the hip or hips with a prosthetic hip. This procedure may sound radical but it has been commonly performed for over 30 years in dogs with great success.  It is a highly invasive procedure, obviously, and infection must be avoided at all costs (no skin disease can be in the skin over the hips, extra precautions for sterility are used). In other words, when complications occur they have the potential to be severe. Complications have about a 10 percent incidence. Expect about three months of exercise restriction after this procedure. Usually, only one hip receives surgery at a time. Often only one replacement is needed and the pet does well enough not to need surgery on the other side. Juvenile Pubic Symphysiodesis This surgery is performed on young puppies before age five months, so it is generally done as a preventive procedure before it is known if the puppy will indeed have dysplastic hips but after hip laxity has been detected. The pubic symphysis is the cartilage seam connecting the right side of the pelvis to the left side. As an individual matures, this cartilage converts to bone and the two halves of the pelvis fuse permanently. This surgery prematurely seals the symphysis, which in turn results in rotating the developing hip sockets into a more normal alignment. This is the same re-configuring as the TPO above but instead of doing the reconfiguring with surgery, it is done by directing the puppy’s own bone growth. The window is very narrow for this procedure so if a puppy is a predisposed breed it may be worth getting screening radiographs around age 4 months even though no physical discomfort has developed. It may be worth having this preventive procedure while the puppy is still at an age to benefit from it. No matter which, if any, procedure is selected, it is important to get an idea of expenses, recovery procedure, and what is entailed from your veterinarian and the surgeon before making a decision. What Non-Surgical Treatment is Available? Non-surgical treatment of hip dysplasia is essentially the same as a non-surgical treatment for any other type of arthritis. There are nutritional supplements to help repair cartilage, pain medications, and anti-inflammatory medications. Physical therapy and massage are also important and helpful in non-surgical joint therapy. There is no medical way to reverse or prevent hip dysplasia; the medications described are for pain management.  For details, seemedications for degenerative arthritis.

Category: Hip Dysplasia in Dogs - Background, Signs and Diagnosis
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Hip Dysplasia? Hip dysplasia occurs in many species (including humans and cats) but is mainly a concern in dogs. It can occur in any breed or size of the dog but is more common and tends to be a bigger issue in larger breeds. An Overview The hip is the ball and socket joint that connects the hind limb to the pelvis. The femur is the thigh bone. The ball is called the femoral head, and the socket in the pelvis is the acetabulum. The ball and socket grow in concert with one another in the normal hip joint. The ball sits deeply in the socket and rotates within. The ball and socket are held together by a ligament (a band of tough tissue between the bones), a joint capsule (which also contains joint or synovial fluid), and muscles that connect the pelvis to the femur. Articular cartilage (joint) lines the ball and socket. In a hip with dysplasia (dysplasiameaning abnormal growth and development), the connection between the ball and socket becomes looser than what is considered normal. This results in abnormal movement of the ball in and out of the socket in addition to the regular rotation, and the shape and depth of the socket or the shape of the femoral head may also be altered. A scale is used to rate a hip’s condition, with “more normal” on one end of the spectrum and “more dysplastic” on the other. The higher the rating is on the dysplastic side, the more likely the dog will show abnormal movement as they walk or run. Healthy joint cartilage and proper lubrication by joint fluids result in a nearly frictionless and smooth motion. Abnormal hip movement affects hip function, tiring the muscles surrounding the hip as the dog moves or engages in activity. This abnormal motion eventually wears down the joint cartilage and can result in permanent damage with loss of smooth function. Damaged joint cartilage does not repair well, and further changes to cartilage and bone occur as the process continues. These changes and the resultant bone-on-bone rubbing from the loss of cartilage can cause pain. This process of cartilage damage, loss, and changes to the joint capsule and bones is termed osteoarthritis (“OA”) or degenerative joint disease (“DJD”). Signs of Hip Dysplasiain Younger Dogs Signs of hip dysplasia may be observed in puppies before one year of age. Most of these signs will be mechanical lameness, although some may also have early symptoms of arthritis. In some dogs, signs of mechanical lameness may seem to disappear around one year of age until about two to four years of age, when osteoarthritis progresses and symptoms recur. However, many dogs with hip dysplasia never have recognizable signs or only display such signs when they are older. In younger dogs, the signs of hip dysplasia include:  Puppies with dysplasia may “bunny hop” with the two hind limbs together when running or climbing stairs. Before OA sets in, young dogs might not be in obvious pain except for some muscle soreness. The signs often do not respond much to analgesics (pain medications) or anti-inflammatory medications. An owner might notice poor muscle development in the dog’s hind limbs or notice the hip bones seem more pronounced. This is due to poor muscle mass around the point of the hips. Sometimes, an obvious “pop” from the hip area can be heard or felt as the dog moves because the ball is moving inappropriately in and out of the socket. Arthritis and Signs of Hip Dysplasia in Older Dogs Even in “normal” joints, arthritis can be a part of aging, but if a dog has dysplasia, arthritis can develop much sooner than it might in a dog without the condition. The signs of pain and limping or lameness are more likely when arthritis is present. As arthritis progresses, pain may start to increase. Signs of arthritis pain, in addition to some of those signs described above with mechanical lameness, can be:   Arthritis pain is more responsive to anti-inflammatory and pain medications than mechanical lameness alone. Your dog’s lifestyle can affect the degree of pain. Working dogs may exhibit more pain than less active house pets. Thigh muscle atrophy (loss of muscle mass) may be noticed as the dog bears less weight on the affected limb. What Causes Hip Dysplasia? Hip dysplasia results from a combination of genetic makeup and environmental factors. A veterinarian relies on tests of a dog’s phenotype to decide where the dog’s hips are on the spectrum of more normal or more dysplastic. Phenotype is the result of genotype (the genetic makeup inherited from the parents) and environmental factors, such as diet and hormones. Since hip dysplasia is felt to be mostly due to underlying genes and less to environmental influence, assessment of phenotype gives a decent view of a dog’s genetic “load”. However, genes and hereditary traits don’t always show up in every animal, and even if hips fall into the more ”normal” range for phenotype, the genes for hip dysplasia may still be carried and passed on to future generations. Thus, dogs with “normal” hips and “normal” pedigrees may yet produce puppies with the condition. Hip dysplasia is considered to be a “developmental” disease rather than congenital (a disease present at birth), so a dog can have “normal” hips at a younger age and then develop the condition or have the condition worsen later in life. About 95% of dogs with hip dysplasia will have detectable evidence by the time they are two years old, although they may or may not have or develop signs. Diagnostics/Testing Palpation In young dogs, the veterinarian may perform an Ortolani test. This involves palpation (manipulation) to look for abnormal movement of the ball and socket joints. More normal hips would lack the loose movement of hip dysplasia. This test is not always accurate, unfortunately. Not every veterinarian is skilled at performing the test. Some dogs with severe hip dysplasia may either have a very shallow socket and/or a femoral head so far out of the socket that it can no longer be moved in and out, resulting in a “negative” test.  Older dogs may have changes in the bones and joint capsule, resulting in a negative Ortolani test. Palpation at any age also includes checking the range of motion in the hips, and feeling for grinding caused by bone-on-bone rubbing, or bone spurs that develop as part of the osteoarthritis process. X-rays X-rays are done for screening in working dogs, dogs intended for an athletic lifestyle, dogs meant for breeding, or done as part of an examination when hip dysplasia is suspected as a cause of hind end pain or lameness. Various techniques for X-raying hips have been developed, and all require sedation to be done properly. Certifications Dogs meant for careers as working or breeding animals will most likely require certifying evaluations related to conditions common in their breed. There are organizations that give ratings for hip dysplasia: OFA The Orthopedic Foundation for Animalshas been around for many decades, and board-certified radiologists assign their scores. These results are somewhat subjective. Although OFA can screen dogs of any age, they will not certify a dog as free of hip dysplasia unless the dog is at least 24 months old. This can be disadvantageous since owners would like to know sooner if a dog is suitable for its upcoming breeding or working career. The X-ray positioning needed for OFA certification can also cause results to be misjudged, usually by missing some dogs who have hip dysplasia and calling them normal. However, despite these shortcomings, the OFA screening test is still the one most familiar to breeders. PennHip An alternative and increasingly popular technique developed at the University of Pennsylvania, this test includes the same X-ray used by OFA but also two additional views. It mimics the Ortolani test (mentioned above), giving a graphic and measurable demonstration of the laxity (slackness) in the hips. PennHip measurements can be done as early as four months of age and compare results obtained for that particular breed. Because actual measurements are used, PennHip is more objective than OFA. Rather than certifying dogs as “normal” or describing them as “dysplastic” (as with OFA results), PennHip recommends limiting breeding to those dogs in the best half of hip scores for that breed. Breeders can choose to be more conservative if they wish. For puppies intended for working careers, the results of PennHip will help guide which ones are more suitable and which might be less suitable. Drawbacks to the PennHip method are that only veterinarians trained and certified can perform the test, and it costs a bit more than OFA. As noted above, X-ray screening at an early age makes sense for puppies intended for breeding later in life or those that are intended for athletic working careers. For the average pet dog, there may be less value to such screening because neither the presence of laxity nor even the finding of osteoarthritis can accurately predict whether the dog will have symptoms of hip dysplasia in the future, and if so, how severe those symptoms might be. On the other hand, knowing that a puppy has hip dysplasia might put the veterinarian and owner “on alert” for possible signs to watch for, or lead to a consultation with an orthopedic surgeon for additional guidance. Owners should discuss with their veterinarian whether to do routine screening (often done at the same time a dog is anesthetized for castration or spay surgery, but sometimes even sooner) based on the intended use of the dog and any other concerns. X-rays are always a suitable diagnostic test for dogs with hind-end lameness or signs of hip pain. The caution here is that the mere presence of hip dysplasia and/or arthritis – regardless of how bad the hips may look on an X-ray – is not conclusive for blaming hind end lameness or pain on the hips unless all other potential causes have been ruled out. Even if some X-rays taken earlier in life showed that a dog was dysplastic, this does not prove that any new lameness or pain in the hind end is due to the hips. Neither owners nor veterinarians should have “tunnel vision” and assume that hind limb lameness is due to hip dysplasia, regardless of how severe any such dysplasia seems on X-rays.

Category: Hip Dysplasia in Dogs: Prevention and Treatment
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   Deciding how best to treat a dog diagnosed with hip dysplasia can be complicated. Because there are so many variables and no one-size-fits-all solutions, treatment advice is often best given by a specialist in orthopedic surgery. Your veterinarian can refer you to a veterinary orthopedic surgeon. Prevention and Treatment Factors To Consider Issues to think about when considering treatment of hip dysplasia include: Treatment approaches can be divided into prophylactic (preventative) or therapeutic (treatment of and continued care for active signs) approaches. Other than careful screening of potential parents and selective breeding, there are few options for controlling an offspring's phenotype (observable traits). There are a few main areas to consider when considering the environmental factors that might contribute to a patient’s phenotype. Nutritional Factors Overfeeding and overly-rich diets have been shown to increase the risk of hip dysplasia. Although owners of large-breed puppies want to see their dogs grow to the largest possible size, their final adult size is largely determined by genetics. Very poor nutrition could stunt growth, but overfeeding or feeding overly rich foods only results in morerapidattainment of that final adult size. Rapid growth is a risk factor for hip dysplasia and several other orthopedic diseases. Special diets developed for large breed growth are probably the best choice. Excess weight can cause increased signs in patients with mechanical lameness or osteoarthritis, so keeping dogs with hip dysplasia on the leaner side is often helpful for controlling signs. Hormonal Factors The hormones testosterone and estrogen play a role in bone growth. If a dog is spayed or castrated before bone growth is complete, the surgery is expected to have some impact on its development. Lack of testosterone in male puppies results in delayed maturing of the skeleton, so male dogs castrated as puppies tend to have longer bones and grow a bit taller. Evidence shows that similar changes occur in bone growth in female puppies that are spayed at a too-young age. Dogs castrated before 5.5 months of age have a slightly higher incidence of hip dysplasia than those spayed or castrated after 5.5 months. Exercise In dogs with hip osteoarthritis, the best approach is to have regular, moderate activity and avoid being too inactive or too physical. Climbing stairs has been shown to be a risk factor in puppies under three months old. No convincing studies show the amount or type of other activities a puppy engages in affects the development of hip dysplasia. Because little can be done to prevent hip dysplasia in dogs genetically inclined to the disease, most treatment focuses on dogs with the disease already present.   Treatment Options Treatment options are divided into the following: medical (non-surgical) or surgical. The most important rule of thumb for dog owners and veterinarians is to “treat the patient and not the X-rays.”  No matter how bad a dog’s hip might feel or how it looks on an X-ray, it may not require medical or surgical treatment unless there are signs of discomfort, lameness, or decreased athletic ability. Medical Management Medical management is usually tried before surgery is considered and can include such things as: Medical management is the first line of treatment for dogs with hip pain or evidence of osteoarthritis and may be all that is needed. Some of these supplements or treatments have good supporting evidence for their usefulness, while others lack such convincing evidence. Except for treating certain young dogs with surgery designed to improve hip mechanics before arthritis sets in, medical management is usually tried before any consideration is given to surgery. Surgery Treatments can help control the signs of the arthritic condition but won’t stop the underlying condition. If this approach fails, then surgery is considered. If your veterinarian recommends a surgical consultation with an orthopedic specialist for your dog, the surgeon will explain the type of surgery recommended and the intended outcome. Prognosis and Conclusions Although no one wants to have a dog with lameness problems, and though some lamenesses are due to hip dysplasia, the diagnosis of a dog being dysplastic is not a reason for panic or dread. Many dogs with some degree of hip dysplasia can be asymptomatic (having no signs) for some or even all their lives. Treatment options are available at every stage of a dog’s life to manage hip dysplasia medically or surgically and to allow your dog to enjoy a pain-free, active lifestyle. Preventing hip dysplasia lies mostly with breeders doing a reputable job of screening potential parents and striving to only breed dogs with the best quality hips, understanding that, lacking a genetic test to guide breeding decisions, even pedigrees with no history of hip dysplasia have the potential to produce offspring with the unfortunate combination of genes that predispose to looser hips. Proper nutrition during growth may help lessen the expression of genes responsible for hip laxity. Key takeaways for owners include understanding that not all hind-end lameness or pain problems are due to bad hips (even if X-rays reveal hip dysplasia and arthritis), and that symptomatic hip dysplasia with arthritis is often problematic in its onset, waxes and wanes, and may be misinterpreted as an aging problem rather than a treatable orthopedic problem.

Category: Hypertrophic Osteodystrophy (HOD) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hypertrophic osteodystrophy is a developmental, auto-inflammatory disease of the bones that is usually first seen between 7 weeks and 8 months of age.  In general, most cases will appear for the first time when the puppy is between 3 – 5 months of age. Relapses may occur until about 20 months of age. HOD is most often seen in fast-growing puppies of large and giant breeds. Some medium-sized breeds, such as the Australian cattle dog and pit bull may also develop HOD. The Weimaraner, in particular, appears to be predisposed to HOD. Predisposed breeds include: In HOD, blood flow decreases to a part of the bone next to the joint. This interrupts bone formation. The interruption means that bones don't harden appropriately, nor do they grow as strong as those of a healthy puppy. HOD can be very painful. Sometimes HOD is straightforward and responds quickly to treatment, but it can also be tricky to diagnose and treat. HOD is somewhat similar to panosteitis (pano) in that it affects the growing leg bones of large- or giant-breed puppies. However, pano usually affects only one leg at a time, and is thought of as “growing pains.” HOD can affect more than one leg at the same time and is more painful than panosteitis. In addition, unlike pano, HOD can permanently damage the growth plates. HOD doesn’t appear to be inherited, and at this time no one knows how puppies get it, although auto-immune diseases and dietary excesses can trigger it. However, because it is more common in some breeds if the puppy is being considered for breeding purposes, your veterinarian may recommend a thorough review of the pup's relatives, to see how many of them have had HOD. If the puppy comes from a bloodline that has few cases, or the cases were mild and self-limiting, that may be better for breeding purposes than bloodlines that have had many cases, or have severe cases. (Every pup, of every breed, being purchased for breeding purposes should always have an extensive review of the relatives, to avoid known breed-related issues.) Clinical Signs Clinical signs depend on how mild or severe the HOD is. For mild cases, the puppy usually has a slight limp and appears to have pain in the affected bone. Puppies with more severe cases may have a decreased appetite and subsequent weight loss, fever, and depression. Unfortunately, these non-specific signs can happen with many diseases. More specific signs of HOD include swollen, warm, and painful leg bones. The puppy may refuse to bear weight. If multiple limbs are affected, the puppy may prefer to remain lying down, be reluctant to get up, and be unwilling to walk. And not just the legs may be involved. Some cases have swollen muzzles, excessive salivation, and pain when the dog tries to open his mouth; these cases may involve the jaw. Also, radiographs may show changes in the jaw, spine, ribs, shoulder, and eye socket bones. Systemic signs can include: At the very least, HOD dogs will have a fever, lameness, and typical HOD lesions showing on the radiographs. The more signs the puppy has, the more severe the case. (In severe cases, with multiple systems and organs affected, more aggressive treatment to suppress the immune system will be necessary.) A complicating factor to remember is that, for the most part, HOD patients are very young puppies that do not have bodily reserves and can decline rapidly with fever and lack of appetite. HOD can be a painful condition and typical treatment to control even significant pain may not work. HOD generally comes in episodes that last a few weeks. Often the first episode lasts a week and it can be followed by a full and spontaneous remission. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made via physical exam (seeing obviously swollen soft tissue over the leg bones), radiographs, blood tests, etc. Treatment Your veterinarian will want to control the fever, lethargy, and bone pain.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) are often used for this. However, if the puppy develops gastrointestinal signs, the NSAIDs may have to be discontinued. Some puppies may need immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids, usually prednisone. Some dogs may need to take them for a year, in which case the drug must be tapered off slowly, rather than simply stopped. Your veterinarian will recommend tapering only once the dog is free of pain and walks normally. In some cases, narcotics may be necessary to control severe pain. These may have to be given by intravenous injection. Some breed-specific studies have shown better responses to corticosteroids than to NSAIDs. In one study of 53 Weimaraners, 50 percent did not respond to NSAIDs. In another study of six related Weimaraners, NSAIDs had little effect and the dogs had to be switched to corticosteroids. A similar experience has been reported in affected Irish setters and Australian kelpies. Your veterinarian may need to prescribeantibioticsforpneumoniaor to prevent secondary infections resulting from immune systems that have been depressed by the corticosteroids. Antacids, such asfamotidine, may be given while the dog is taking the corticosteroids.Some veterinarians may recommend probiotics when the GI tract is involved.Pain medications may be needed. Other care may include fluid therapy, analgesics (e.g.tramadol, opiates), and rest or restricted activity. Even when the puppy starts feeling better, the veterinarian may still want exercise to be restricted until the bones have structurally recovered. Vaccines should be avoided during an active HOD episode. Monitoring and Prognosis Mild cases of HOD may resolve on their own or with only supportive care. Watch for a possible return of any clinical signs once the dog has stopped/tapered the NSAIDs or prednisone because recurrences are common until the leg bone has finished growing. Dogs with affected litter mates are more likely to relapse. Complete recovery is expected once the leg is finished growing, but relapses (episodes of fever and malaise) have been reported in adult dogs. Most relapses in adult dogs respond to NSAIDs or corticosteroids. Permanent limb deformities are rare. However, if they occur, surgery may help. Your veterinarian will use radiographs to determine if surgery is indicated. Prevention While it’s difficult to prevent a disease when you don’t know what causes it, some common sense can boost the chances that a puppy won’t get it. Large- or giant-breed puppies should not be given any mineral or vitamin supplements that aim to increase their growth rate and adult size. Slow and consistent growth is ideal for the puppy’s health because rapid growth can cause skeletal abnormalities. Puppies need a completely balanced diet. Puppies should be discouraged from doing jumping exercises until their growth plates have closed, which is at about a year of age. (Check with your veterinarian for an appropriate estimate of growth plate closure based on your puppy’s breed and growth.) Avoid housing puppies on hard surfaces, such as concrete. If floors are not carpeted, rugs may help so the puppies don’t slip as much. Prognosis Most cases of HOD are resolved with or without medical care. Unfortunately, sometimes HOD is so severe, painful, and uncontrolled by treatment that owners are forced to discuss the pet’s quality of life issues, resulting ineuthanasia.

Category: Legg-Perthes Disease in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Legg-Perthes disease has many “aliases:”  Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, aseptic necrosis of the femoral head, and avascular necrosis of the femoral head.  By any name, this is a disease producing lameness of the hip joint in young, small breed dogs.  Toy breeds or terriers in the five to eight month-old range are the most common patients, but a wide range of small breeds up to a year of age can be affected.  The problem begins with an interruption in blood supply to the head of the femur, which is the “ball” portion of the hip’s ball and socket joint.  Portions of the boney tissues, starved of their blood supply, begin to die and the overlying cartilage that lines the hip joint collapses.  This leaves a painful, poorly-fitting hip joint.  Initially, the dog will show pain and lameness.  Some owners describe these dogs crying out when they stretch the limb or try to bear weight.  As the lameness continues and the dog favors the leg, the muscles of the hip and thigh region will begin to shrink from lack of use. Legg-Perthes disease usually involves only one hip but approximately one out of every six or eight cases will involve both hips. Breed Predilection AffenpinscherAustralian terrierBichon FriseBoston terrierCairn terrierChihuahuaCocker spanielDachshundFox terrierJack Russell terrierLakeland TerrierManchester terrierMiniature pinscherMiniature schnauzerPekingesePomeranianPoodlePugSchipperkeScottish terrierShetland sheepdogSilky terrierSmall breedTerriersToy breedsWelsh terrierWest highland white terrier What Causes Legg-Perthes Disease? While trauma to the hip can occasionally be the cause of the disruption in blood supply, most cases are thought to be genetically determined. Diagnosis Diagnosis of this condition requires radiographs of the hips.  In the early stages of the disease, the normal density of the bone in the femoral head may be diminished.  With time, the top surface of the femoral head will become flattened and misshapen as the cartilage and underlying bone collapses. Treatment Treating Legg-Perthes disease inevitably involves surgery.  While your veterinarian may prescribe anti-inflammatory/pain relieving medications that can ease the pain, these almost never resolve the problem.  The best solution is a surgical procedure called a femoral head and neck ostectomy (FHNO).  The FHNO involves surgical removal of the diseased femoral head and neck that is the source of the pain.  For most owners, the concept of the FHNO is a tough one to understand.  After all, if the femoral head and neck, which constitutes half of the hip joint, are removed can the dog return to functional use of the leg?   The answer is yes for two reasons.  First, the major muscles surrounding the hip joint attach at points other than on the femoral head or neck, predominantly on the top of the femur, much like the supporting ropes are strung from the top of a tent pole.  Removing the femoral head and neck does not interfere with these major supporting muscles in the hind leg.  Second, with the removal of the painful femoral head and neck, the body forms a “false joint” consisting of a cushion of scar tissue between the cut edge and the hip socket.  The result, especially in small to medium size dogs, is a pain-free return to good function in the vast majority of cases. Post-operative monitoring of the patient is especially important to ensure that they begin to use the surgically repaired leg.  Most dogs will begin to bear weight within the first 1 to 2 weeks after FHNO.  This schedule can be delayed, especially if there has been significant muscle weakening leading up to the surgery.  In many cases, your veterinarian will recommend a course of post-operative physiotherapy exercises to help strengthen the muscles.  The best physiotherapy of all is having the dog walk and run on the leg and this should be encouraged as soon after surgery as possible.

Category: Lumbosacral Disease in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The cauda equina is made of the tail end of the spinal cord and the adjacent nerve roots. Sometimes, the spinal canal, through which the spinal cord and nerves pass, narrows and then compresses the nerves. The most common spot for this narrowing is at the lumbosacral joint, where the spine meets the pelvis. Spinal canal narrowing at that joint is referred to as lumbosacral stenosis, and the condition resulting from these compressed spinal nerve roots is called cauda equina syndrome or lumbosacral compression syndrome. Sometimes, these changes can be congenital (an animal is born with it), but they can also develop as the dog gets older. Causes In some cases, the foramina (the holes through which the spinal nerves exit) becomes narrowed and compress the nerves either permanently or intermittently. Intermittent compression is common in very athletic dogs. Narrowing of the spinal canal is most often caused by arthritic degeneration or intervertebral disc herniation, but traumatic injury, congenital malformation, or tumor growth can also be involved. Narrowing of the foramina can be caused by new bone growth, the spurs that grow as a result of arthritis, or by overgrown soft tissue from the capsule surrounding the joints. The most common symptom of lumbosacral stenosis is pain. In the beginning, you may notice your dog has hind end stiffness that leads to difficulty in walking, climbing stairs, getting on furniture, wagging the tail, positioning to defecate, or getting into a car. As the condition progresses, one or both back legs may become weak. Some dogs will cry out in pain when trying to move. In severe cases, the nerve roots can become so compressed that urinary and fecal incontinence will result; however, this is less frequently seen.Trapping of the nerves can also cause intermittent pain and leg tremors, depending on the dog's position. German shepherd dogs and other large, active breeds are most commonly affected. However, it can also affect smaller breeds and even cats. Signs in dogs younger than three to seven years old are unusual. Diagnosis When you present your dog to a veterinarian, they will take a thorough history from you to determine what signs you are seeing at home. If you can capture your pet moving/walking at home on video, this may be helpful to your veterinarian. They may also observe your dog walking and possibly getting in/out of the car or going up and down stairs at the clinic. A physical examination will then be performed, including an orthopedic examination to check the bones and joints followed by a neurological examination to assess nerve function.  Several tests will then be performed to locate the site of pain. This may involve manipulating both back legs, pushing on the spine, or moving the tail. Additional diagnostic tests are usually required to establish the diagnosis. These can include X-rays, CT scans, MRI, and rarely electromyography, a diagnostic procedure that evaluates the health of the muscles and the nerve cells that control them. Advanced imaging techniques - especially MRI - have become the tests of choice for lumbosacral disease and are now thought to be essential when planning treatment, whether this be medical or surgical. Treatment Treating lumbosacral disease depends on the cause and severity of the symptoms. Mild cases often need only supportive treatment, including crate rest, controlled exercise on lead, and anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving medications. Sometimes, injections around the spinal cord, usually steroids, are needed. If symptoms persist or worsen or if neurologic signs develop, surgery may be required. A dorsal laminectomy creates an opening in the top of the spinal canal to relieve pressure from the nerves. Occasionally, adjacent unstable spinal vertebrae may have to be fused to prevent recurrent nerve trauma. If the foramina are narrowed, they may also need to be widened, which can be done in the same surgery. Strict rest in the postoperative period is essential to minimize complications. Outlook (Prognosis) Dogs with mild signs have a good prognosis as they can be medically treated. Severely affected dogs, including those whose nerve root compression is so severe that urinary or fecal incontinence has resulted, have a poor prognosis as most dogs do not become continent again, even after surgery.  However, surgery or epidural cortisone can relieve pain and improve quality of life.

Category: Lupoid Onychodystrophy in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Lupoid onychodystrophy, sometimes called lupoid onychitis, is a disease that affects the toenails or claws of dogs. The disease usually affects multiple claws on all four paws. Toenails will split or crack easily; become brittle, thick, or deformed; and in some cases, toenails may fall off, leaving the nailbed (also called the quick) exposed. Nails will come out at such odd angles that they look misshapen. The pet may lick his toes and paws frequently or have trouble walking. Gordon Setters and German Shepherd Dogs are the most common dog breeds that develop lupoid onychodystrophy. The disease usually starts between 2-6 years of age. Veterinary scientists are not exactly sure what causes it, but the disease appears to be immune-mediated, meaning that it is triggered by an overactive immune system. Scientists also believe lupoid onychodystrophy can be inherited from one or both of the dog’s parents. Diagnosing Lupoid Onychodystrophy Lupoid onychodystrophy only affects the toenails. Because of this, veterinarians may be able topresumptivelydiagnose the disease based on the history and symptoms. This means they don’t officially diagnose the condition but make an educated guess based on the exam, symptoms, and signs the dog is showing. If the veterinarian suspects lupoid onychodystrophy, they may start treatment to see if the toenails improve. If a diagnosis isn’t clear, tests may be needed torule outor cross other diseases of concern off the list of potential causes. Bacteria and yeast infections, ringworm, and occasionally cancer can cause similar symptoms. Useful tests may include a biopsy of the nailbed; culture of the affected claws to grow yeast, bacteria, or ringworm; or microscopic examination of nailbed cells, also known as cytology. X-rays may be needed as well to make sure the toe bones are healthy. Treatment Treating lupoid onychodystrophy is difficult because no single treatment has been proven to work effectively in every dog. It can also take 6-12 weeks before the toenails start to improve, and treatments are usually needed lifelong. Common treatments include a combination of fatty acids, vitamin E, niacinamide,tetracycline,pentoxifylline, and medications to suppress the immune system (e.g.cyclosporine,prednisone). In many cases, the combination of medications will need to be adjusted several times, usually after 4-8 weeks, before finding the treatments that work best for that dog. It is important to give all medications as prescribed by the veterinarian for the appropriate length of time, even if you do not feel they are working. It is also important to avoid the temptation to try and treat your pet yourself. While some of these medications can be bought over the counter, the dosages differ depending on the combination of medications used and some can cause issues if too much is given. Call your veterinarian if you are concerned about your pet’s current treatment plan or if you feel the medications are causing your pet discomfort.

Category: Masticatory Myositis (Eosinophilic Myositis) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It may start suddenly one day or come on gradually. The dog seems to be in pain when his mouth opens or when he attempts to chew. Perhaps he will not open his mouth at all. There are many possible explanations for this situation, and masticatory myositis is only one of them. In fact, most possibilities are far less exotic than the immune-mediated muscle disease that is the subject of this article, so a step-by-step approach is important. What is Trismus? In short, trismus is the inability to open your mouth. Regardless of whether or not it’s painful to attempt, the mouth simply cannot be opened. Of course, a dog with a painful mouth may be unwilling to open his jaws and there is no way to ask the dog if it simply hurts to open his mouth or if it is not possible to open it. Possible explanations are: Sorting these out will require general anesthesia to get the mouth open and check for painful oral conditions (broken teeth, oral foreign bodies, growths inside the mouth). It may be necessary to take radiographs to assess the temporomandibular (jaw) joints and jaw bones themselves. If nothing is found in the mouth to explain the problem, tests for masticatory myositis should be considered. Polymyositis is difficult to distinguish from masticatory myositis. Polymyositis is a more generalized muscle inflammation involving other muscles beyond those of mastication. Polymyositis patients will be negative on the 2M antibody test but so are up to 15% of patients with masticatory myositis. A muscle biopsy may be necessary to distinguish these conditions. Electromyography, which measures electrical activity in muscles, may also be helpful. What are Masticatory Muscles? The masticatory muscles are the muscles used in mastication (chewing). They include the powerful jaw muscles and temple muscles. The word myositis means muscle inflammation. No other muscles are affected in masticatory myositis. The masticatory muscles are all supplied with nerves by part of the trigeminal nerve. Any disease that affects the trigeminal nerve will lead to marked atrophy of the muscles that masticate. Patients with trigeminal nerve disease, however, have dropped jaw that cannot stay closed rather than trismus. What Makes These Muscles So Unique That a Disease Process Would Affect Only Them? The chewing muscles have a special molecular structure because of the unique nerve branches that serve them. Chewing muscles contain what are called type 2M muscle fibers, which occur nowhere else in the body. Masticatory myositis arises when the immune system inappropriately attacks these 2M muscle fibers. What causes the immune system to do this is still unknown. Profile of the Masticatory Myositis Patient The average patient age is three years old. The most common breeds are German shepherds, Labrador retrievers, Doberman pinschers, Golden retrievers, and Cavalier King Charles spaniels. Patients can be of either gender. In the acute phase of the disease, the masticatory muscles are swollen and the eyes appear to bulge due to the swollen pterygoid muscles behind them. There may be a fever and local lymph node swelling at this stage. Results are best if therapy is initiated at this point, but unfortunately, many owners do not notice the problem until the muscles begin to atrophy and the jaws are rigidly closed, making eating difficult. You would expect the muscle atrophy and pain of this condition to be symmetrical, but this is not always the case. Lack of symmetry certainly is not evidence against masticatory myositis. Diagnosis of Masticatory Myositis Patients with masticatory myositis produce antibodies against the 2M muscle fibers, and thanks to Dr. G. Diane Shelton and her lab at the University of California at San Diego, it is possible to test for these antibodies with a blood test. Since blood sampling is not very invasive, this is often done to confirm the disease early in a medical workup. That said, Dr. Shelton recommends collecting a biopsy from the temporalis muscle in addition to sending the blood sample as, the degree of scarring in the muscle will be helpful in staging the severity of the disease and in assessing the patient's ability to respond to treatment. Approximately 15 percent of patients will test negative for antibodies even though they have the disease, and the muscle biopsy also helps sort these patients out from those with more general muscle inflammation. Specimens for submission can be sent directly to Dr. Shelton’s lab. Treatment In short, treatment is the suppression of the immune system, usually through high doses (rather than the more commonly used lower anti-inflammatory doses) of corticosteroids such asprednisoneordexamethasone. High doses should be maintained until the jaw seems to open normally, a process that can be as short as one month. After that, the dose may be gradually tapered off over 6 months. In many cases, the drug cannot ever be completely stopped. Patients on long-term prednisone will drink and urinate excessively. Screening for latent bladder infection is important. See more details onchronic prednisone therapy. If prednisone therapy is problematic,azathioprinecan be used to spare the amount of prednisone necessary to achieve remission. Azathioprine is an agent of chemotherapy as well as an immune suppressive agent and is not used lightly. Monitoring blood tests is recommended for long-term use. Alternatively,cyclosporine, an immunomodulator, has been used to supplement the steroid treatment. If therapy is discontinued prematurely, relapse is common. The earlier treatment begins, the better the prognosis. If the inflammation has caused too much scarring, the results are not as good. As mentioned, a muscle biopsy is helpful in assessing the extent of the scarring. Semi-liquid diets may be needed to feed the patient with trismus. Do not try to force the jaws open, as this can dislocate or even break the jaw. Encouraging the use of chew toys, however, can be helpful in physical therapy. Dogs with end-stage disease have so much scarring that they cannot eat effectively, and malnutrition is a big problem. Surgery may be useful to remove a portion of the front jaw to allow the dog to be able to lap food with the tongue. Alternatively, a feeding tube can be placed so that a liquid diet can be directly instilled into the stomach or esophagus. It is important to treat the disease when it is in an early stage, and the prognosis is good so as to avoid these procedures. The results of corticosteroid treatment are best early in the course of the disease. If the disease has progressed to an advanced state before treatment is initiated, there may be no response. In a study of 18 dogs with Masticatory Myositis, short-term follow-up was available in 14 out of those 18 dogs. Complete response, i.e., full range of jaw motion regained, was seen in eight out of the 14 dogs, with all eight of them having been treated with immunosuppressive doses of prednisone. Partial response, i.e., improved but not full range of jaw movement, was seen in five out of 14 dogs--immunosuppressive doses of prednisone were given in four out of those five dogs, and an anti-inflammatory dose of prednisone was given in one of those five dogs. No response was seen in one dog who was treated with low-dose dexamethasone. Recurrence following initial treatment was seen in three out of 13 dogs who had partial or complete responses initially. Long-term (five months to seven years) follow-up was available in nine out of 14. Eight had no recurrence and good jaw mobility, five out of eight were off all medication, two out of eight died of unrelated causes while still on prednisone, and one was still on prednisone 1-year postdiagnosis. The remaining dog was the one who had shown no response--no improvement was seen. Long-term (five months to seven years) follow-up was available in nine of the 14. Eight had no recurrence and good jaw mobility, five of eight were off all medication, two of eight died of unrelated causes while still on prednisone, and one was still on prednisone one year after diagnosis. The remaining dog was the one who had shown no response and no improvement was seen.

Category: Medial Luxating Patella in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The medial luxating patella, commonly called a trick knee, is an extremely common problem in toy-breed dogs. An owner typically notices a little skip in the dog’s step. The dog may even run on three legs, holding one hind leg up, and then miraculously be back on four legs as if nothing has happened. In fact, something has happened: the kneecap (patella) has slipped out of the smooth groove in which it normally rides up and down. It has slipped medially, which is to say towards the opposite leg, as opposed to laterally, which would be away from the dog entirely. With the patella dislocated (or luxated) medially, the knee cannot extend properly and stays bent. With luck, the patient will be able to slip the kneecap back where it belongs and be back to normal in only a few steps. For some dogs, getting a kneecap back where it belongs and normal extension of the rear leg is a mere dream only attainable with surgical correction. Approximately 50 percent of affected dogs have both knees involved, while the other 50 percent have only one knee involved. Which Dogs Need Correction? Medial patellar luxations are graded to assess severity. Grade I: The kneecap can be moved out of place manually but will fall back into its natural position once the manipulator lets go. Treatment for this form is rarely needed. Grade 2: The kneecap occasionally slips out of its groove, spontaneously creating an intermittent lameness. The kneecap will go back in place on its own. Whether or not it needs surgery depends on several factors: how often lameness is a problem, how long lameness lasts when it is a problem. Another reason to proceed with surgical intervention is for prevention. If the ridge of bone on the inside of the knee wears down, the Grade 2 will progress to Grade 3. This progression can be prevented with surgery. Grade 3: The patella is out of place all the time but can be manipulated back into its normal position manually (though it will not stay there). At this point, the dog may seem to crouch or slant down in the rear. Lameness or rear weakness may be persistent. The dog may have a bow-legged appearance. These patients should have knee surgery to correct these problems. Grade 4: The patella is out of place all the time, and no amount of manipulation can return it to its proper place. Such a dog has extreme difficulty extending his knees and walks with his knees bent virtually all the time in a somewhat crouched position. In this situation, the rotation in the long bones accompanying the luxation will interfere with surgical correction, and total resolution of the lameness may not be possible. Surgery is definitely in order, though success is somewhat variable as this is a very advanced situation. When a kneecap is out of place, the entire weight-bearing stress of the rear leg is altered, which, in time, leads to changes in the hips, long bones, and ultimately, arthritis. How severe the changes are depends on how severe the luxation is (i.e., the grade as described above) and how long that degree of luxation has been going on. In time, the legs will actually turn outward with its muscles turning inward, making the dog bow-legged. The luxation is not considered a painful condition, but after enough time and conformational change, arthritis sets in, which is indeed painful. This surgery is a procedure that not all veterinarians are comfortable performing. Discuss with your veterinarian whether a referral to a specialist would be best for you and your pet. What Surgical Procedures Are Available? Lateral Imbrication (also called Lateral Reinforcement)This procedure alone may be adequate for a mild case but is often used as an adjunctive procedure to supplement one of the other surgeries. When the patella slips out of its groove, the joint capsule surrounding it is stretched to allow this motion. Imbrication simply involves taking a tuck in the joint capsule. The tightened joint capsule does not allow for the slipping of the kneecap and the kneecap is confined to its proper groove. Trochlear ModificationThe patella rides in a groove at the bottom of the femur (thigh bone). In toy breed dogs this groove is shallow, which allows the patella to slip. If the groove is deepened, the patella stays where it belongs. The normal groove in the femur is lined by slippery lubricated cartilage, called hyaline cartilage. This cartilage is peeled or cut away, the bone underneath is sliced out to form a deeper groove, and the cartilage is replaced. Techniques that do not preserve the original cartilage are no longer recommended. Tibial Crest Transposition (also called Tibial Tuberosity Transposition) If the knock-kneed conformation has already started to set in, the tibias (or leg bones) will have rotated. In particular, the crest on the tibia where the thigh muscle (the quadriceps femoris) attaches may have migrated inward. If this is the case, the crest will have to be removed and pinned back where it belongs to straighten out the leg. Severe rotation of the tibias may involve actually cutting through the entire bone and de-rotating it back into place. The Ridgestop Implant (New)The Ridgestop implant is a small curved plate that essentially adds height to the ridge of bone on the inside of the knee. By making this area larger, the kneecap becomes unable to slip over it. This technique can be used as a sole solution for Grade 2 luxations or as an adjunct to the other surgical repairs. Should both Knees be Repaired at the Same Time or Should They Be Staged? Some surgeons feel that doing one leg at a time, eight weeks or more apart, is beneficial as the patient will have one good rear leg upon which to walk. If the patient is very young (under age one year) it may be a good idea to do both legs at the same time so as to prevent conformational problems in the leg that is not operated on first. Every surgeon will have their own philosophy on whether or not to do both legs at once. Consult your surgeon about the pros and cons and decide. Post-operative Care If imbrication was the only procedure, expect three to four weeks of confinement to a large crate or pen, during which the pet will need to be carried outside for bathroom functions. If any of the other procedures above were utilized, expect more like six to eight weeks of confinement depending on the surgeon’s preference. During this time easy walking (no running or jumping) is helpful. The dog should be using the leg by two weeks post-operatively though some dogs must be retrained to use the leg after surgery. Physical therapy is in order if the dog is not using the leg after one month. The American College of Veterinary Surgeons hasadditional informationon patellar luxation.

Category: Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If your adolescent puppy becomes lame or stiff when rising or after play on one or more legs, there are several possible reasons for it. One reason is a disease called osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). OCD negatively impacts the cartilage in certain joints. Cartilage is connective tissue that provides cushioning on the joint surface to soften the impact when walking and running. When the cartilage is damaged, the joint cannot function properly; discomfort and pain become lasting effects. OCD is a condition where a cartilage flap forms during development. This flap will induce a painful inflammatory response within the joint. In some situations, the flap separates, floating uselessly around the inside of the joint and causing pain and further destruction to the joint. OCD is most commonly seen in the shoulder, but can also be seen in the knee, elbow, and ankle joints. OCD causes differing levels of pain and lameness, making it hard for your young dog to be active. Generally speaking, OCD is a developmental disease seen in rapidly growing puppies of some but not all large breeds, including Great Danes, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Golden Retrievers, and German Shepherds. Some breeds are more likely to have it than others. It's typically a disease of adolescence with onset often seen around the age of 4 to 9 months. In people, it is usually seen in children and adolescents. OCD is seen far more often in male dogs than females. If your dog is stiff and sore after rising or heavy play, or is lame, it's best to see the veterinarian as early as possible. Typically, when a lameness is noted in a young dog with an OCD lesion (the entire area affected), the lesion is chronic and warrants immediate treatment. Causes No one really knows what causes OCD, although various factors can contribute. A hereditary component is suspected in most dogs, especially Newfoundlands. Before you buy a puppy, ask your breeder specifically if the puppy's parents have OCD. In general, it is considered multi-factorial in that a combination of factors contribute to it. Along with genetics, diet also plays a role; in particular, puppies whose diet has too much calcium or vitamin D. Supplementation should be avoided in puppies. In addition, any effort to make the dog grow as big as possible as quickly as possible should be avoided. It's healthiest to let the dog grow to the size nature intended without any dietary interference. Other potential causes of OCD include injury, lack of blood flow and hormonal issues. Signs Dogs will initially show stiffness and soreness when rising or after heavy play. Overtime, this will turn into a limp in the affected leg or legs because they avoid bearing weight on a painful leg. If you press on that sore area, the dog may cry. Sometimes an affected joint is warm and swollen. Lameness is a sign of pain. An OCD lesion can either be constant or once in a while. Diagnosis Most dogs are taken to the veterinarian because they are stiff after rising or play or are lame in at least one leg. Various causes of stiffness and lameness can occur in the joints of developing dogs. Diseases and problems such as elbow dysplasia, patella (kneecap) luxation, and growth plate fractures can have similar signs as an OCD lesion.  A thorough orthopedic examination and imaging should be performed by your veterinarian for a diagnosis and to rule out other diseases. Radiographs (X-rays) should always be taken in a lame growing dog. Oftentimes sedation is needed because specific positioning is necessary, and several images must be taken. Radiographs are a great screening tool, but an OCD lesion is not always seen. In some cases, your veterinarian may prefer that the X-rays be reviewed by a veterinary radiologist. If there is a high suspicion of an OCD lesion, your veterinarian may recommend a CT scan or even an arthroscopy evaluation. A CT scan allows veterinarians to view the bone in more of a three-dimensional manner while an arthroscopic examination involves inserting a small video camera into the joint. This allows direct visualization and treatment of an OCD lesion. Treatment Obviously, treatment depends on severity of the OCD lesion. Conservative management is only recommended for dogs less than 6 months of age with minimal clinical signs and no overt radiographic changes. Conservative management may consist of pain medications, exercise restriction, dietary changes, and formal rehabilitation therapy. For any dog over the age of 6 months, conservative management of an OCD lesion is likely to be ineffective. Surgery is indicated to remove the cartilage flap and to stimulate the underlying bone bed to form scar tissue (fibrocartilage).  In some cases with large lesions, an artificial plug may be inserted into the bone bed. Arthroscopic surgery is the gold standard for OCD treatment given the minimally invasive nature, better visualization, and quicker recovery. Total recovery time is about 8-12 weeks of exercise restriction to avoid running, jumping, and playing. The first 2 weeks after surgery activity is restricted to short, leashed walks - basically just enough for the dog to relieve themselves along with passive range of motion exercises. Beginning 2 weeks after surgery, a structured daily leash walking program and home exercise plan are begun along with formal rehabilitation guided by a rehabilitation therapist. Prognosis The earlier the problem is dealt with, the better the prognosis is. Any stiffness or lameness in a puppy warrants immediate evaluation by your veterinarian. More times than not, the stiffness or lameness may not be anything significant. However, the earlier your veterinarian can diagnosis the problem and recommended surgery, the better off your dog's recovery will be. Your dog's prognosis depends on which joint or joints are affected, and how severely. Prognosis for full recovery is good if only the shoulder is affected. Other joint involvement has a more guarded prognosis, meaning progression of arthritis as well as possible periods of intermittent lameness. Keeping your dog at a healthy weight helps keep the joints working properly. Your veterinarian can help you help your dog lose weight if that would be beneficial.

Category: Osteosarcoma in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  What is Osteosarcoma? Osteosarcoma is by far the most common bone tumor of dogs, usually striking the leg bones of larger breeds. Osteosarcoma usually occurs in middle aged or elderly dogs but can occur in a dog of any age; larger breeds tend to develop tumors at younger ages. How do we Know my Dog Really has an Osteosarcoma? Radiographs (x-rays)The lytic lesion looks like an area of bone has been eaten away. One of the first steps in evaluating a persistent lameness is radiography (x-rays). Bone tumors are tender so it is usually clear what part of the limb should be radiographed. The osteosarcoma creates some characteristic findings. Radiography is almost completely diagnostic in most cases, but there are a few other far less common conditions that can mimic the appearance of a bone tumor, so a confirming test is going to be needed if one is to be complete. If a basic blood panel and urinalysis haven't been done, this would also be a good time to do so as basic information about liver and kidney function will be needed for treatment regardless of whether this turns out to be a bone tumor or not; plus, a tissue sample from the bone is needed for confirmation (see later). Tissue Sampling: Biopsy and Needle AspirateRadiographs are close to being confirmatory but still they are not definitive. Since life and death decisions are going to be made, it is best to obtain a tissue sample for confirmation. This can be done by either biopsy or by needle aspirate. BiopsyA small piece of bone can be harvested surgically. The bone is preserved, sectioned, and examined under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. There are several problems associated with this diagnostic.  Sometimes a bone tumor is surrounded by an area of bone inflammation and it may be difficult to get a representative sample. The tiny hole that results when a core of bone is removed can create a weak spot and the bone can actually break. Even if the procedure goes well, often there is increased pain and lameness for the patient afterwards. With so many potential problems, most specialists have switched to needle aspirate for diagnosis. Needle AspirateWith needle aspirate, a large bore needle is inserted into the area of the tumor and cells are withdrawn for analysis. A full core of bone is not removed, just a sampling of cells. This is usually sufficient to confirm osteosarcoma. If there is ambiguity, certain stains can often settle any questions the pathologist may have. With a Diagnosis Confirmed, Staging is the next Consideration Osteosarcoma is an aggressive tumor and it can be assumed to have spread by the time it is first diagnosed; there is no possibility of preventing spread. That said, how well treatments can be expected to work depend on whether or not the tumor spread has progressed so as to be visible. Because osteosarcoma spreads to the lungs as one of its first stops, chest radiographs are important in checking for visible tumor spread. If there is already visible tumor spread at diagnosis, this changes what treatments are recommended. Some specialists recommend nuclear imaging of the skeleton to identify any spread to other bones, which might also alter recommendations; however, this form of imaging is not readily available. What if it isn’t Really an Osteosarcoma? The location and radiographic appearance of the osteosarcoma in the limb are quite classic but there are a few outside possibilities that should at least be mentioned. Only a few other possible conditions cause similar lesions in bone: the chondrosarcoma, the squamous cell carcinoma, the synovial cell sarcoma, or fungal bone infection. ChondrosarcomaChondrosarcoma is a cartilage tumor, possibly not as malignant as the osteosarcoma. The chondrosarcoma generally occurs on flat bones such as ribs or skull bones and is not usually found in the limbs. Still, should a chondrosarcoma occur in the limb, treatment recommendations still include amputation of the affected bone and many of the same treatments as for osteosarcoma. Squamous Cell CarcinomaThesquamous cell carcinomais a tumor of the external coating of the bone, called the periosteum. This is a destructive tumor locally but it tends to spread relatively slowly. Again, a bone suspected of malignant tumor should be amputated, and the tissue then analyzed and then treatment adjustments should be made thereafter. The squamous cell carcinoma tends not to arise in the same bone areas as the osteosarcoma; it tends to arise in the jaw bones or in the toe bones. Synovial Cell SarcomaThis is a tumor of the joint capsule lining. Its hallmark is that it affects both bones of the joint. The osteosarcoma, no matter how large or destructive it becomes, will never cross over to an adjacent bone. Prognosis is much better with amputation with synovial cell sarcoma. Fungal Bone InfectionCoccidiodes immitisis a fungus native to the lower Sonoran life zone of the southwestern United States. It is the infectious agent of the disease called San Joaquin Valley Fever or justValley Fever. (More scientifically, the condition is called coccidioidomycosis.)  In most cases, infection is limited to a few calcified lymph nodes in the chest and possibly lung disease. In some rare cases, though, the fungus disseminated through the body and can cause a very proliferative bone infection. The bone infection of coccidiodomycosis grows rapidly and lacks the lytic lesions that are typical of the osteosarcoma. Other fungi, such as Histoplasma capsulatum, also have potential for bone involvement. Pursuit of this possibility makes sense if you live in an area where these fungi are a concern. Disseminated fungal disease is serious and even though this diagnosis is not cancerous, amputating the limb is most likely going to be necessary. Treatment of osteosarcoma involves two aspects:treating the pain and fighting the cancer’s spread. How do we Treat the Pain? Keep in mind that dogs are usually euthanized because of the pain in the affected bone. Treating the pain successfully will allow a dog to live comfortably and extend life expectancy by virtue of extending comfort. There are two ways to address the pain: amputatating the limb and palliative radiotherapy (usually combined with periodic bisphosphonate infusion treatments). For most patients, there is one tumor on a leg and no visible tumor spread in the lungs. These are the patients with the best potential results and they are good candidates for amputation. Patients with a lot of arthritis in the other legs or with tumor spread evident in the chest already are probably not candidates for amputation and it may be more appropriate to keep the leg and simply relieve the pain with radiotherapy. Amputating the LimbSince the tumor in the limb is the source of pain, it makes sense that amputating the limb would resolve the pain. In fact, this is true. Removing the affected limb resolves the pain in 100 percent of cases. Unfortunately, many people are reluctant to have this procedure performed because of misconceptions. Read a letterabout amputation from a veterinarian who sees too many owners who reject the option of amputation out of hand. His letter includes videos of two happy dogs without limbs. Limb-sparing Surgery (removing the tumor but not the leg)Limb-sparing techniques developed for humans have been adapted for dogs. To spare the limb and thus avoid amputation, the tumorous bone is removed and either replaced by a bone graft from a bone bank or the remaining bone can be re-grown via a new technique called bone transport osteogenesis. The joint nearest the tumor is fused (i.e., fixed in one position and cannot be flexed or extended.) While amputation can be viewed as a pain management strategy, limb-sparing is only performed in conjunction with chemotherapy. It is important to keep in mind that grafting of a new bone structure requires healing time and that a great deal of post-operative confinement time is needed (in a patient whose life expectancy is going to be measured in months). For the right patient, limb-sparing can be the best choice but be sure to understand all the details of post-operative care from the specialist. Palliative Radiotherapy for Pain ControlSometimes amputation is simply not the right choice and happily there is an effective alternative treatment. Radiation can be applied to the tumor in two, three or four doses, depending on the protocol. Improved limb function is usually evident within the first 3 weeks and typically lasts 2 to 4 months. When pain returns, radiation can be given again for further pain relief if deemed appropriate based on the stage of the cancer at that time. There are a couple of caveats: Current standard treatment involves pairing palliative radiation with monthly infusions of medications called bisphosphonates. BisphosphonatesThis class of drug has become the standard of care in humans with bone tumors and have been found helpful in managing osteosarcoma pain in dogs as well. Bisphosphonates act by inhibiting bone destruction, which in turn helps control the pain and bone damage caused by the bone tumor. The most common bisphosphonate in use for dogs has been pamidronate, though a new drug zoledronate is taking its place gradually. Treatment is given as an IV drip over two hours in the hospital every 3 to 4 weeks. In humans, an assortment of potential side effects have emerged (fever, muscle pain, nausea all lasting 1 to 2 days in up to 25 percent of patients, renal disease in certain situations, low blood calcium levels, jaw bone cell death); these issues so far have not panned out as problems for dogs and cats. Bisphosphonates are important in managing bone tumor pain in patients that have no undergone amputation. Analgesic DrugsAt this time there are numerous analgesic medications available for dogs with this tumor. No single medication, however, is a match for the pain involved in what amounts to a slowly exploding bone. A combination of medications is needed to be reasonably palliative and should be considered only as a last resort if amputation or radiation therapy will not be pursued. There are several types of drugs that can be combined. These different drugs are often given together to create analgesia to the osteosarcoma patient when amputation and radiotherapy are not going to happen. It is important to realize that there is a limit to how much pain relief can be achieved against a bone tumor with only pills. It will not be long before the pain of this tumor, as evidenced by not using the leg, tenderness to the touch, etc., overpowers the effect of oral medications. How do we Treat the Cancer? Osteosarcoma is unfortunately a fast-spreading tumor. By the time the tumor is found, it is considered to have already spread. Osteosarcoma spreads to the lung in a malignant process called metastasis. Prognosis is substantially worse if the tumor spread is visible on chest radiographs, so if you are contemplating chemotherapy, chest radiographs should be taken. Cisplatin(given by IV every 3 to 4 weeks for 3 treatments) Carboplatin(given by IV every 3 to 4 weeks for 4 treatments) Doxorubicin(given IV every 2 weeks for 5 treatments) Doxorubicin and Cisplatin in Combination(both given IV together every 3 weeks for four treatments) What is Median Survival Time? There are a number of ways to statistically evaluate the central tendency of a group. The median is the value at which 50% of the group falls above and 50% of the group falls below. This is a little different from the average of the group, though more people are familiar with this term. When evaluating median survival times, you are looking at a 50% chance of surviving longer than the median and a 50% chance of surviving less than the median. What Does Chemotherapy Put my Dog Through? Most people have an image of the chemotherapy patient either through experience or the media and this image typically includes lots of weakness, nausea, and hair loss. In fact, the animal experience in chemotherapy is not nearly as dramatic. After the pet has a treatment, expect 1 to 2 days of lethargy and nausea. This is often substantially helped with medications like Zofran, a strong anti-nausea drug commonly used in chemotherapy patients. These side effects are worse if a combination of drugs is used but the pet is typically back to normal by the third day after treatment. Effectively, you are trading 8 days of sickness for 6 to 12 months of quality life. Hair loss is not usually a feature of animal chemotherapy. In dogs, hair loss may occur in breeds that have continuously growing coats, such as poodles, Scottish terriers, and Westies. Axial Osteosarcoma While osteosarcoma of the limbs is the classical form of this disease, osteosarcoma can develop anywhere there is bone. "Axial" osteosarcoma is the term for osteosarcoma originating in bones other than limb bones, with the most common affected bones being the jaws (both lower and upper). Victims of the axial form of osteosarcoma tend to be smaller, middle-aged, and females outnumber males two to one. In the axial skeleton the tumor does not grow rapidly as do the appendicular tumors, thus leading to a more insidious course of disease. The tumor may be there for as long as two years before it is formally diagnosed. An exception is osteosarcoma of the rib, which tends to be more aggressive than other axial osteosarcomas. Treatment for axial osteosarcoma is similar to that for the appendicular form: surgery followed by chemotherapy. There is one exception, that being osteosarcoma of the lower jaw. Because of the slower growth of the axial tumor and the ability to remove part or all of the jaw bone with little loss of function or cosmetic disfigurement, it has been reported that 71% of cases survived one year or longer with no chemotherapy at all.

Category: Panosteitis: Growing Pains in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English (Also called enostosis, or pano for short) Growing Pains for Dogs? We have all heard the term growing pains, and when this term is applied to dogs, more often than not, it is referring to panosteitis. Growing pains in children involve leg pains of unclear origin, which generally resolve when the child enters the teen years. Panosteitis in dogs is a specific painful bone condition involving the long leg bones of large breed dogs, generally between ages 5 and 18 months. The condition can be quite painful during its flare-ups but ultimately resolves permanently when the pup outgrows it. As in humans with growing pains, the cause of panosteitis is not clear-cut. Panosteitis is often referred to as growing pains because of its similarity to the human malady. Diagnosis of panosteitis is relatively straightforward. The clinical picture of an adolescent large breed dog with a long bone lameness is suggestive of numerous developmental bone diseases, and panosteitis is only one of them, but it does have some characteristic features: hypertrophic osteodystrophy, osteochondrosis dissecans, panosteitis, etc. In panosteitis, about three to four male pups are diagnosed for every female, though either sex can get affected. Further, while larger breeds are more usually affected, any breed potentially could develop this condition. The lameness can shift from one leg to another and can be accompanied by fever. Painful episodestypicallylast two to five weeks but recur, often changing legs, until the puppy outgrows the condition. Some individuals experience a recurrence around age 2 years, but again the symptoms simply regress as before. In panosteitis, characteristic cloudiness in the bone marrow cavities is visible on radiographs. If there is any doubt about whether these lesions are really there, radiographs can be repeated in a couple of weeks and the lesions will likely be more prominent. The classical cloudiness is seen in the adjacent radiograph. If there is still any question about the diagnosis in a given patient, a nuclear medicine scan will definitively settle the question, but this is rarely necessary. What Causes Panosteitis? What is actually happening inside a bone with panosteitis is complicated. A bone’s marrow cavity contains two types of marrow: hemopoietic marrow, which produces blood cells, and fatty marrow, which is basically just fat. In panosteitis, the fatty marrow is replaced with fibrous tissue. The fibrous tissue is then replaced by a type of bone called woven bone. Woven bone is represented by the fluffy blurriness seen on the X-ray image. The marrow cavity can be nearly obliterated by encroaching woven bone. Eventually, the normal bone cells involved in bone remodeling take over, building new bone where it should be and dissolving bone where it should not be. Ultimately, the bone tissue is re-structured back to normal. What causes all this to happen in the first place is unclear and open to speculation. The most current theory is that the recent trend in high-protein dog foods is to blame. The idea here is that protein accumulation in the bone marrow leads to fluid accumulation and swelling inside the bone. Because the bone is a rigid structure and cannot expand, pressure is exerted on the blood vessels, leading to tissue death, inflammation, and the panosteitis phenomenon. Over-supplementation should be avoided, and proper large-breed puppy foods should be employed as prevention. Since there is a breed predisposition for panosteitis (German shepherd dogs, Golden retrievers, Basset hounds, Doberman pinschers, and Labrador retrievers), this implies a genetic basis. It has often been noted that most of the breeds predisposed to panosteitis are the same ones predisposed to the genetic blood clotting disorder calledVon Willebrand’s Disease. It has been suggested that dogs with panosteitis be screened for Von Willebrand’s Disease as part of their evaluation. The fact is that the cause of panosteitis is still a matter of theory and investigation. Treatment As mentioned, the only treatment is pain relief until the dog outgrows the condition. For most dogs this means one of the anti-inflammatory pain relievers made for dogs. If this is inadequate,combinations of adjunctive therapy and pain relievers can be used. The ultimate cure, however, is time. The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Patellar Luxation in Dogs Ranges in Severity
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   Patellar luxation, or knee dislocation, can range in severity from a knee that dislocates when extended completely and snaps back into place to a knee that is permanently dislocated medially (toward the center of the dog’s body). Cause One of the causes of patellar luxation is an abnormal shape of the distal end (the end furthest away) of the femur, resulting in a shallow patellar groove. The kneecap sits in this groove, allowing the kneecap to move back and forth. The other major cause is a displacement of the quadriceps tendon's attachment to the tibia so that the patella is displaced medially (towards the middle) when the quadriceps muscle is flexed. The tendency toluxate to the medial sidecauses a transient lameness, at least until the patella returns to its normal position, if possible. The extent of patellar luxation increases with time as the femur's trochlear groove becomes flatter, as increased bowing of the leg takes place, and as the structures of the stifle joint weaken. Continued deformity of the joint results in degenerative joint disease, pain, and decreased mobility. Patellar luxation can be caused by defects in your dog’s anatomy or by injury. It is a common condition and can be genetic, but not all cases are. It is uncommon in cats. Some breeds have a higher incidence than others. Breeds known to have this condition include:  Severity Dislocation is graded by severity. Four grades of dislocation are recognized: Grade 1:The patella luxates with manual pressure and returns spontaneously. Dogs may not show any signs and may not require treatment. Grade 2:The patella luxates with joint flexion and extension but returns to the patellar groove spontaneously. Some lameness and minimal degenerative joint disease may be present. Conservative management and supportive care may be all that is needed. Conservative therapy includes rest, physical rehabilitation, chondroprotective agents (disease-modifying drugs used for osteoarthritis, known as DMOADs), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Grade 3:The patella luxates with joint flexion and extension but can be reduced manually. Considerable lameness exists.Grade 4:The patella is permanently luxated to the medial side. The limb or limbs are unable to extend and the dog walks while balancing their weight on the forelimbs. Treatment Treatment is dependent on the clinical signs, the severity of luxation, and the age of the dog. If your dog has frequent or bothersome clinical signs (frequent or persistent episodes of lameness) of patellar luxation of any grade, your veterinarian may recommend surgery. Dogs with Grade 3 or Grade 4 luxation most often benefit from surgery, while dogs with Grade 2 luxation may benefit if they show those signs. After surgery, the dog's activity is usually restricted for six to eight weeks. Post-Surgical Support Supportive therapy is implemented for mildly affected dogs and for those recovering from corrective surgical procedures. Supportive care includes analgesics, exercise restriction, physical rehabilitation, and weight reduction for overweight dogs. Various analgesics are available to relieve pain in dogs, with and without degenerative joint disease. Chondroprotective agents may also be considered. Physical Rehabilitation Physical rehabilitation measures can include low-impact activities, massage, hydrotherapy, and range of motion, strength, and flexibility exercises. These techniques can help accelerate postoperative recovery.

Category: Physical Rehabilitation for Arthritis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Arthritis is a common disease in dogs that involves inflammation of the joints. Dogs can get arthritis at any age and the type they usually get is osteoarthritis. In this form of the disease, the smooth and shock-absorbing cartilage that covers the bones of a joint breaks down, leaving the bones to rub against each other. As you can imagine, this rubbing is quite painful and leads to limping, stiffness, inability to jump and difficulty climbing stairs. Based on these signs, physical exam findings and X-rays, your dog will be diagnosed with osteoarthritis. Once it is determined your dog has arthritis, your veterinarian may recommend physical rehabilitation as part of a multimodal (several methods) treatment plan designed to enhance your dog's quality of life. In fact, they might refer you to a veterinarian specialized or certified in physical rehabilitation for dogs. The goals of physical rehabilitation include strengthening the muscles that support painful joints, improving joint mobility and range of motion, promoting joint health and reducing pain and inflammation. Physical rehabilitation for arthritis includes hands-on techniques, low-impact exercise, cold and heat treatment, laser treatment, electrical stimulation, shock wave treatment and acupuncture, all of which are discussed below. As always, only pursue these treatments at the recommendation of your veterinarian. Hands-on Techniques A veterinarian trained in physical rehabilitation might perform or teach you to perform some manual techniques on your dog. These include massage, stretching muscles and joint manipulation. Massaging may reduce pain and is often used to relax the dog prior to other exercises. Stretching muscles improves the flexibility of painful or tight muscles around affected joints. Joint manipulation involves manually moving the dog's joints to lubricate them, improve range of motion, reduce pain and increase joint stability and blood flow. Therapeutic Exercise Although it seems counterintuitive, exercise is actually quite important for arthritic dogs because the heavier a dog is, the more stress they put on their joints. In addition, fat itself can worsen the inflammation in your dog's joints. Exercise limits these consequences by keeping dogs at aproper weight. Exercise also promotes strong muscles, improves joint function and mobility and may reduce pain. Of course, the exercise needs to be low-impact so as to not put excess stress on the joints. Low-impact exercise includes swimming, short walks on a leash andunderwater treadmills. A rehabilitation veterinarian may also provide some exercises targeted at your pet's individual condition. If performing these exercises at home, you will be instructed on how to properly perform them and progress them over time. Cold and Heat Treatment Applying an ice pack to your dog's joints might reduce the inflammation and numb the pain associated with arthritis. It is usually recommended after exercise or during a flare of increased inflammation and pain. You shouldalwayswrap the ice pack in a towel before applying andneverleave your dog alone with the ice pack. Applying heat to arthritic joints may decrease pain, relax muscles and increase the flexibility of the joint tissues. Heat is often recommended before exercise. Warm towels, heat packs or ultrasound, which penetrates deeper than the other modalities, can be used for this purpose. Laser Treatment With laser treatment, a beam of light energy is applied to your dog's arthritic joints and the surrounding areas. This technique may reduce pain and inflammation and promote the healing of joint tissues. Electrical Stimulation Also known as Estim, this technique applies low-level electrical currents to arthritic joints through gel patches. For maximum effectiveness, the gel patches should stick directly to your dog's skin, which requires fur to be shaved at treatment areas. There are two types of electrical stimulation that might be recommended by your veterinarian. One is called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which is meant to reduce pain. The other type is called neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), which is used to strengthen the muscles surrounding arthritic joints. Shockwave Treatment With shockwave treatment, a probe transmitting high energy sound waves is applied to arthritic areas. This technique is used to promote tissue healing, relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Acupuncture Acupuncture involves placing very small needles into specific locations that have been found to reduce pain and inflammation and improve nerve function. Arthritis is a painful joint disease that dogs commonly suffer from. If your dog is diagnosed with this condition, your veterinarian will pursue a multifaceted treatment plan to reduce their pain and enhance their quality of life. Treatment will be tailored to your pet and it might include medication, lifestyle changes and physical rehabilitation. Many physical rehabilitation techniques are available and your veterinarian will recommend what the most appropriate forms.

Category: Physical Rehabilitation of Dogs Following TPLO
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Physical rehabilitation for pets is still a rather new veterinary discipline, as it has only existed since approximately 2000.  However, the discipline continues to grow, as does the awareness of benefits to dogs. Although rehabilitation fortibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO)is emphasized here, rehabilitation is beneficial in numerous other circumstances. Ask your veterinarian if rehabilitation is appropriate for your pet. Cranial cruciate ligament disease is the most common orthopedic condition in dogs, and TPLO is often the surgery of choice.  Early physical rehabilitation therapy should be considered part of the postoperative management of these dogs. Physical rehabilitation in dogs who have had a TPLO can be divided into three phases for most dogs, and four phases for athletes. Phase 1 begins immediately following surgery and extends until the acute trauma induced by surgery subsides.  Different modalities are used in this phase to help manage pain and inflammation, and to encourage the dog to use the leg. Phase 1 Goals Phase 1 Therapies Phase 2 begins approximately 2 weeks after surgery and lasts until the dog has sufficient strength to begin Phase 3, or core strengthening.  Phase 2 is focused on restoring musculoskeletal strength and maintaining or improving cardiovascular fitness.  Muscle atrophy around the hind limb is often seen in varying degrees.  This atrophy, combined with myofascial trigger points (painful knots in the muscle) produces muscle weakness and dysfunction in the leg.  Myofascial trigger points create muscle dysfunction and weakness by inhibiting and altering muscle firing patterns, also known as motor control and timing. Joint dysfunction is seen with cranial cruciate ligament disease, and it can also affect muscle control and timing. The main goal of this phase is to begin to reverse the joint and muscle dysfunction. Formal rehabilitation should occur 2 to 3 days a week.  On non-therapy days, owners should give passive stretching exercises and controlled leash walks. Phase 2 Goals  Phase 2 Therapies The goal of each therapy session is to push the patient further than the previous one while maintaining control of each exercise.  Always monitor the dog for fatigue. Phase 3 is a continuance of Phase 2. It usually begins after 8-12 sessions of Phase 2 and the patient is 5 to 8 weeks postoperative.   The patient should be walking well with an intermittent to slight weight-bearing lameness that becomes more noticeable when trotting. The dog should have sufficient hind limb muscle strength that will allow more strenuous exercises.  There should be no pain or discomfort when moving or touching the stifle joint; however, there may still be myofascial pain related to trigger points. This phase is similar to the previous one, but is more demanding.  Sessions in the underwater treadmill should be faster and longer, and done often at an incline.  Land treadmill training can be started.  Additionally, it’s time to add exercises to strengthen the core body muscles. In dogs, the core body muscles include all of the back muscles above and below the spine and, to a lesser degree, the abdominals.  The core muscles serve as a foundation for the hind limbs and their weakness may increase the risk of injury, especially in athletes. Phase 3 Goals Phase 3 Therapies If this point ends your dog’s rehabilitation, periodic re-evaluation by a veterinarian is recommended to make sure that no problems exist. Phase 4 Phase 4 is directed more for the canine athlete rather than the pet. This phase usually begins following 20 sessions of rehabilitation and the patient is 9 to 12 weeks postoperative.  Osteotomy healing should be better than 90% complete when this phase begins.  Lameness should not be seen when the dog walks and at the trot is very slight or intermittent if seen at all.  Once again, this continues the previous phase in that many of the exercises are repeated in a more strenuous and demanding fashion.  More demanding core body strengthening, and longer and faster sessions in the underwater treadmill and on the land treadmill are the focus of this phase.  Swimming for increased conditioning may begin.   Treatment of myofascial trigger points continues if needed.  Air-filled devices can be placed in sequence, creating an obstacle course for the dog to negotiate.  This phase takes another 10 to 20 sessions of rehabilitation and lasts another 7 to 10 weeks. Any rehabilitation veterinarian understands that it is difficult to restrain or control a canine athlete that is attempting a progressive return to competition.  Therefore it is crucial to determine if the athlete has sufficient conditioning and strength to withstand brief episodes of full speed activity. Following this phase, the athlete can be placed back into light work-related training. No lameness should be detected when the athlete returns.  Periodic re-evaluation is recommended. Rehabilitation lasts 9 to 12 weeks for dogs going through Phase 3, and 16 to 24 weeks for athletes going through Phase 4.

The Basics The knee is a fairly complicated joint. It consists of the femur above, the tibia below, the kneecap (patella) in front, and the bean-like fabellae behind. Chunks of cartilage called the medial and lateral menisci fit between the femur and tibia and offer some cushion-like support. An assortment of ligaments holds everything together, allowing the knee to bend properly. There are two cruciate ligaments that cross inside the knee joint: the anterior (or, more correctly in animals, cranial) cruciate and the posterior (in animals, the caudal) cruciate. They connect from one side of the femur on top to the opposite side of the tibia on the bottom, the two ligaments forming an X (hence the name cruciate) inside the knee joint. They are named for their attachment site on the tibia (the cranial cruciate attaches to the front of the tibia and the caudal cruciate attaches to the back of the tibia). This may be hard to visualize based on the description but the illustration above shows the orientation of the two crossing ligaments effectively. The anterior/cranial cruciate ligament prevents the tibia from slipping forward out from under the femur. Finding the Rupture The ruptured cruciate ligament is the most common knee injury of dogs; in fact, chances are that any dog with sudden rear leg lameness has a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament rather than something else. The history usually involves a rear leg suddenly so sore that the dog can hardly bear weight on it. If left alone, it will appear to improve over the course of a week or two but the knee will be notably swollen and arthritis will set in quickly. Dogs are often seen by the veterinarian in either the acute stage shortly after the injury or in the chronic stage weeks or months later. The key to the diagnosis of the ruptured cruciate ligament is the demonstration of an abnormal knee motion called a drawer sign. It is not possible for a normal knee to show this sign. The Drawer Sign The veterinarian stabilizes the position of the femur with one hand and manipulates the tibia with the other hand. If the tibia moves forward (like a drawer being opened), the cruciate ligament is ruptured. (See avideoof this manipulation.) Another method is the tibial compression test where the veterinarian stabilizes the femur with one hand and flexes the ankle with the other hand. If the ligament is ruptured, again the tibia moves abnormally forward. If the rupture occurred some time ago, there will be swelling on side of the knee joint that faces the other leg. This is called a medial buttress and is a sign that arthritis is well along. It is not unusual for animals to be tense or frightened at the vet's office. Tense muscles can temporarily stabilize the knee, preventing your veterinarian from being able to try the drawer sign during an examination. Often, sedation is needed to get a good evaluation of the knee. This is especially true with larger dogs. Eliciting a drawer sign can be difficult if the ligament is only partially ruptured so a second opinion may be a good idea if the initial examination is inconclusive. Since arthritis can set in relatively quickly after a cruciate ligament rupture, radiographs to assess arthritis are helpful. Another reason for radiographs is that occasionally when the cruciate ligament tears, a piece of bone where the ligament attaches to the tibia breaks off as well. This will require surgical repair and the surgeon will need to know about it before beginning surgery. Arthritis present prior to surgery limits the extent of the recovery after surgery though surgery is still needed to slow or even curtail further arthritis development. How Rupture Happens Several clinical pictures are seen with ruptured cruciate ligaments. One is a young athletic dog playing roughly who takes a bad step and injures the knee. This is usually a sudden lameness in a young large-breed dog. A recent study identified the following breeds as being particularly at risk for this phenomenon:Labrador retriever, Golden retriever, Rottweiler,Neapolitan mastiff, Newfoundland, Akita, St. Bernard, Chesapeake Bay retriever, and American Staffordshire terrier. On the other hand, an older large dog, especially if overweight, can have weakened ligaments and slowly stretch or partially tear them. A partial rupture may be detected or the problem may not become apparent until the ligament breaks completely. In this type of patient, stepping down off the bed or a small jump can be all it takes to break the ligament. The lameness may be acute but have features of more chronic joint disease or the lameness may simply be a more gradual/chronic problem. Larger, overweight dogs that rupture one cruciate ligament frequently rupture the other one within a year's time. An owner should be prepared for another surgery in this time frame. The cranial cruciate rupture is not limited to large breed dogs. Small dogs can certainly rupture their ligaments as well and, while arthritis is slower to set in when the patient is not as heavy, there is an association with cruciate rupture andmedial luxating patellathat is very common in small breed dogs. With the patellar luxation, the kneecap flips in and out of the patellar groove. If the condition is relatively mild, it may not require surgical correction but it does stress the cranial cruciate ligament and can predispose it to rupture and need to correct both conditions surgically.  What Happens if the Cruciate Rupture is Not Surgically Repaired Without an intact cruciate ligament, the knee is unstable. Wear between the bones and meniscal cartilage becomes abnormal and the joint begins to develop degenerative changes. Bone spurs called osteophytes develop resulting in chronic pain and loss of joint motion. This process can be arrested or slowed by surgery but cannot be reversed. What Happens in Surgical Repair? There are three different surgical repair techniques commonly used today. Every surgeon will have their own preference for which technique is best for a given patient's situation. ExtracapsularRepairThis procedure represents the traditional surgical repair for the cruciate rupture. It can be performed without specialized equipment and is far less invasive than the newer procedures described below. First, the knee joint is opened and inspected. The torn or partly torn cruciate ligament is removed. Any bone spurs of significant size are bitten away with an instrument called a rongeur. If the meniscus is torn, the damaged portion is removed. A large, strong suture is passed around the fabella behind the knee and through a hole drilled in the front of the tibia. This tightens the joint to prevent drawer motion, effectively taking over the job of the cruciate ligament. Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (TPLO)This procedure uses a fresh approach to the biomechanics of the knee joint and was developed with larger breed dogs in mind. The idea is to change the angle at which the femur bears weight on the flat "plateau" of the tibia. The tibia is cut and rotated in such a way that the natural weight-bearing of the dog actually stabilizes the knee joint. As before the knee joint still must be opened and the damaged meniscus removed. The cruciate ligament remnants may or may not be removed depending on the degree of damage.This surgery is complex and involves special training in this specific technique. Many radiographs are necessary to calculate the angle of the osteotomy (the cut in the tibia). This procedure typically costs substantially more than extracapsular repair as it is more invasive to the joint. Tibial Tuberosity Advancement (TTA)The TTA similarly uses the biomechanics of the knee to create stability though this procedure changes the angle of the patellar ligament. This is done by cutting and repositioning the tibial crest where the patellar ligament attaches and implanting a titanium or steel "cage," "fork," and plate as well as bone grafts to stabilize the new angle. Like the TPLO, bone is cut, and special equipment is needed including metal implant plates. Similar recoveries are seen relative to the TPLO. Which Procedure is Better? The TTA and TPLO are much more invasive, much more expensive, and require special equipment and specially trained personnel. They have a greater potential for complications. Are they worth it? For dogs under 45 lbs, it is generally accepted that there is no clear advantage of the newer procedures over extracapsular repair. For larger dogs, there is great controversy. For all the theories behind TPLO and TTA, results in one year post-operative seem to be the same regardless of which of the three procedures the dog had performed. There is some evidence that recovery to normal function may be faster with the newer procedures. Controversy continues and there are strong opinions favoring each of the three procedures. Discuss options with your veterinarian in order to decide. General Rehabilitation after Surgery Rehabilitation following the extracapsular repair method can begin as soon as the pet goes home. The area can be chilled with a padded ice pack for 10 minutes a couple of times daily. (Do not try to make up for a skipped treatment by icing the area longer; prolonged cold exposure can cause injury.) Passive range of motion exercise where the knee is gently flexed and extended can also help. It is important not to induce pain when moving the limb. Let the patient guide you. Avoid twisting the leg. After the stitches or staples are out (or after the skin has healed in about 10 to 14 days), water treadmill exercises can be used if a facility is available. This requires strict observation and, if possible, the patient should wear a life jacket. Rehabilitation for patients with the intracapsular repair is similar but slower in progression. Rehabilitation after TPLO or TTA is gentler. Icing as above and rest are the main modes of therapy. After 3 to 4 weeks, an increase in light activity can be introduced. A water treadmill is helpful. No jumping, running or stair-climbing is allowed at first. Expect the osteotomy site to require a good 6 weeks to heal. What if the Rupture Isn't Discovered for Years and Joint Disease is Already Advanced? A dog with arthritis pain from an old cruciate rupture may still benefit from a TPLO surgery and possibly from the TTA. Ask your veterinarian if it may be worth having a surgery specialist take a look at the knee. Most cases must make do with medical management. Visit our section onarthritis treatment. Meniscal Injury We mentioned the menisci as part of the knee joint. The bones of all joints are capped with cartilage so as provide a slippery surface where the bones contact each other (if the bones contact each other without cartilage, they grind each other down). In addition to these cartilage caps, the stifle joint has two blocks of cartilage in between the bones. These blocks are called the menisci and serve to distribute approximately 65% of the compressive load delivered to the knee. The only other joint with a meniscus is the jaw (temporomandibular joint). When the cruciate ligament ruptures, the medial (on the inner side of the knee) meniscus frequently tears and must either be removed, partly removed, or ideally repaired. This is generally done at the time of cruciate ligament surgery and we would be remiss not to mention it. Pets with meniscal damage may have an audible clicking sound when they walk or when the knee is examined, but for a definitive diagnosis, the menisci must actually be inspected during surgery. It is difficult to access the menisci and thus repairing a tear in the meniscus is problematic; furthermore, the poor blood supply to the menisci also makes good healing less likely. For these reasons, removal of the damaged portion of the meniscus is the most common surgical choice. This leaves some meniscus behind to distribute the compression load on the knee but removes the painful, ineffective portion. Areas of current research include techniques to improve blood supply to the healing meniscus so that repair can be more feasible. If meniscal damage has occurred in a cruciate rupture, arthritis is inevitable and surgery should be considered a palliative procedure. Enhancing Recovery after Surgery ConfinementEnhancing recovery post-operatively is largely about strict confinement early. This cannot be over-emphasized. Be prepared to crate your dog or employ a pen such as a child's playpen depending on the dog's size. A corral of sorts can be constructed with boxes and a baby gate. Be sure you understand the instructions with regard to a gradual return to exercise over several months. Adequan InjectionsA series ofAdequaninjections can help with joint inflammation as well as lubrication. Typically injections are given twice a week for a total of eight injections. GlucosamineOral joint supplements such asglucosaminecontain cartilage building blocks to help the body repair cartilage damage. This is an excellent time to begin supplementation and there are numerous brands. Weight ManagementOverweight dogs have an increased risk for arthritis and cruciate rupture. A weight management program can reduce the potential for arthritis and can reduce the risk of rupture of the opposite cruciate ligament. If your dog is overweight, ask your vet about a weight management plan that might be started during the recovery period. Professional Rehab/Physical TherapyNothing compares to professional rehab for a return to function. If you are lucky enough to have such a facility in your area, consider utilizing their services. A list of home exercises may be obtained and/or the dog can visit weekly or a few times weekly for exercise and treatment. Some facilities allow the dog to board and have daily treatment. Ask your vet about this option.

Category: Swimmer’s Tail in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Swimmer’s tail is known by many names, including limber tail, cold water tail, dead tail, broken wag and sprained tail. These names all refer to the same condition: a suddenly limp and flaccid tail. Swimmer’s tail most commonly affects large breed, hunting, athletic and working dogs such as Labrador retrievers and pointers. Dogs with this condition have essentially strained the muscles in their tail. This is thought to result from overuse of the tail, which can happen when a dog swims for a long time, especially in cold water. Sometimes it happens just because the dog has had an exciting day or two and has spent far more time than usual wagging their tail. For example, maybe they spent the weekend at the lake or the grandchildren came to visit. Other risk factors for swimmer's tail include intense physical activity, prolonged transport in a cage and being in cold and wet weather. After these activities, signs usually appear quickly, within hours to days. The primary sign of this condition is a limp tail that droops between the dog's legs. In some cases the entire tail is flaccid, but in other cases the tail is stiff at the beginning and becomes flaccid towards the end. Because swimmer's tail can cause pain and discomfort, affected dogs may pace, yelp when lying down or defecating, frequently change position while lying down, and eat less. Some dogs may struggle to stand up because the tail helps with balancing. Other potential symptoms include chewing the tail and raised hair on the top of the tail due to swelling. To diagnose this condition, your veterinarian will rely on information about your dog's recent activities, clinical signs and physical exam findings. Your veterinarian may also take X-rays to rule out other causes of your dog's symptoms, such as tail fractures. Once swimmer's tail is diagnosed, your dog should rest and exercise less to allow for recovery, just as you would do if you sprained a muscle. Your veterinarian may also recommend giving anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce the pain associated with this condition. Warm compresses on the tail may also help with pain and quicken the recovery process. Swimmer's tail has an excellent prognosis, as dogs generally get better within 2-14 days. However, having swimmer’s tail once does not mean your dog can't get it again. Relapses are possible. Potential ways to prevent swimmer's tail include not overexerting your dog, especially if they aren't trained for it, and, during transport, letting your dog out every 4 hours or so. There is no prevention for over-wagging when your dog is really happy, though!

Category: Thoracolumbar to Tail IVDD in Dogs: Background and Signs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   Introduction The canine spine is a complex structure composed of vertebrae, joints, ligaments, muscles, and intervertebral discs (IVDs). These discs, located between vertebrae, play a crucial role in providing flexibility and shock absorption. Intervertebral discs have two internal parts called theannulus fibrosus, a tougher, fibrous ring, and the jelly-like innernucleus pulposus, which act as cushions and shock absorbers of the spine. Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) is a disease affecting the intervertebral discs. Discs are prone to degeneration. Most degenerative disc disease is related to aging. Degenerative Disorders Degenerative disc diseases canlead tovariousconditions. Fibroid metaplasia: This involves the nucleus pulposus losing water content, causing discs to stiffen. These degenerations may appear on imaging but usually don't cause issues.The degenerative process is usually asymptomatic (without signs) because there are no sensory nerves in the discs. As the IVDs lose their ability to act as shock absorbers, there is increased movement between the adjacent vertebral bones. This can result in the production of bony spurs (spondyle) that might join and partially fuse the vertebrae (spondylosis). This is usually asymptomatic but will be visible on X-rays. Chondroid degenerationis genetic and starts early in life. Studies have shown that about 90% of breeds like Dachshunds and Shih Tzus will have evidence of this form of IVDD by the time they reach one to two years of age. This condition may involve the build-up of mineral deposits in discs, visible on X-rays. In most cases, it doesn’t cause pain or other issues.  Herniation IVDD signs surface when discs herniate(bulge)or move from their normal positions and press against or impact the spinal cord or the nerve roots. A herniation is more common with discs that have already undergone some degeneration. Disc herniations are more likely to cause neurological deficits rather than just pain. Herniations in the thoracic spine are uncommon due to limited motion and strong ligaments. Humans with such symptoms refer to this as a slipped disc. The technical term for a slipped disc is intervertebral disc herniation (IVDH). Because the nucleus pulposus is closer to the top of each disc and the annulus fibrosus is thinner there, disc herniations usually occur toward the top. This is where the spinal cord and nerve roots are inside the bony tube or vertebral canal. Three major forms of such herniation are recognized. Protrusions, extrusions, and ANNPE usually occur spontaneously, with no specific event or cause preceding the onset of signs. It is common for dog owners to report that signs began after their dog fell or jumped from furniture or downstairs. In fact, disc herniation likely occurred first, resulting in the fall. The rarest form of IVDH is traumatic disc extrusion, caused by severe external trauma, such as a car accident or falling from a great height. Symptoms of IVDH may come on gradually or very suddenly, depending on the amount of herniated disc material and the rate at which it protrudes or extrudes. Most severe signs, especially if they come on quickly, are associated with disc extrusions rather than protrusions and usually require surgery for treatment. Dogs with less severe signs need to be watched very carefully for evidence of progressive worsening since that will affect the type of treatment used. Root Signatures Discs do not have pain sensors, so there are usually no signs of disc degeneration. Signs of IVDD usually only occur when a protrusion or extrusion occurs. The most common sign is pain, usually due to pressure from the herniated disc. If disc herniation occurs in the mid-lumbar and low lumbar area (or lumbosacral area, the disc between the 7th lumbar vertebra and the sacrum), signs can be related to the limb served by the affected nerve root(s). In humans, this is reported as numbness, tingling, shooting pains, and weakness in the leg. Dogs may limp, hold the leg up, or lick at the limb. This is termed a “root signature”. Signs of Herniation Pain is a prominent sign as well as a reluctance to walk, altered play behavior, or the inability to control the bladder or bowels. Dogs may show behaviors like tensing stomach muscles and root signatures. These signs may include limping, holding a leg up, or licking at the limb when a nerve is compressed, as mentioned above. Signsof mid-to-lower back herniationcan include areluctance to walk, altered play, restlessness, hunched back, vocalization, and potential tail issues. Severity of Signs The severity of signs depends on factors like spinal cord compression and the speed of disc herniation. Signs can range from mild pain and coordination problems to severe difficulties in standing and walking, weakness, and even paralysis. Complications Complications include ascending or descendingmyelomalacia, a rare condition where damage from a herniated disc spreads along the spinal cord. Unfortunately, this can lead to severe symptoms, and euthanasia may be recommended. Conclusion Understanding IVDD in dogs involves recognizing degenerative and herniation-related issues. While degenerative changes may not be painful, herniations can cause pain and loss of nerve function. Diagnostic imaging is crucial for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Category: Thoracolumbar to Tail IVDD in Dogs: Diagnosis and Treatment
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  If your dog is showing signs of back problems, your veterinarian will likely perform general and neurological examinations. If your dog suddenly can't walk, this is an emergency. See a veterinarian right away. Your veterinarian may initially believe the problem is in the belly rather than the back. If pain is the only sign, a set of tests (abdominal X-rays, lab tests, etc.) may be recommended, looking for the causes of pain. Once the problem is recognized as spinal, your veterinarian may perform a neurologic exam to locate the cause. If examining reflexes and sensations identifies the spinal cord region as the source of the signs, the severity will be assessed. Spinal X-rays (radiographs) are commonly recommended. Standard X-rays can show other causes of spinal problems, such as fractures (broken vertebrae), bone tumors, or signs of infection. However, X-rays may not be of much value for diagnosing Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD), especially in chondrodystrophic dogs (short-legged, long-bodied dogs), where intervertebral disc herniation (IVDH) is considered the most likely diagnosis. Standard X-rays cannot provide a definitive diagnosis, and knowing the exact disc involved will not affect the treatment choices. No further diagnostics are needed if signs are mild and non-progressive, and the plan is for non-surgical treatment. Treatment Conservative Treatment If a dog shows pain or signs of pain due to IVDH, treatment often starts with non-surgical methods. The key to successful treatment is strict activity restriction. The goal is to reduce inflammation and allow healing while watching to see if the signs improve. Your dog should be confined in a crate, limiting movement to bathroom breaks on a leash for two to four weeks, even if they seem to improve. Your veterinarian may prescribe painkillers, anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, or sedatives, but these only manage signs. Crate rest is essential to prevent relapse, even if your dog seems better. If signs persist or return or pain becomes disabling, surgery might be needed. Dogs with mild neurological signs (like weakness or incoordination) may start with conservative treatment, but if there is no improvement, surgery should be considered. Advanced Diagnostic Imaging If your dog’s signs are more severe or worsening, a referral to a surgeon is indicated for treatment. The surgeon will then use advanced diagnostic imaging tools to achieve an accurate diagnosis. None of these imaging options — standard X-rays, myelogram, CT, CT/myelogram, or MRI — are recommended unless surgical treatment is planned. Knowing the exact location and specific cause of the problem won’t change the non-surgical treatment options. Surgical Management Treatment for IVDH is generally based on the severity of the signs, progression of signs, history (previous bouts of similar signs), and response. The severity of signs can be ordered from least to most concerning as follows: As the signs of IVDH progress, it is less likely that a dog will recover without surgery, and the prognosis for recovery with surgery also becomes less likely. While there is no perfect cut-off point at which a patient might be referred for surgery, a general guideline is that surgery is indicated for any non-ambulatory dog. Surgical Procedures The goal of IVDH surgery is to decompress (take the pressure off) the spinal cord and nerve roots. Surgery generally cannot fix any internal spinal cord injuries but hopes to end the signs from compression or deformation of the spinal cord and nerve roots and to allow better blood flow to the spinal cord for healing and recovery of function. The surgical procedure will depend on the nature of the injury or condition. Your dog's veterinary surgeon will explain the planned surgical procedure and discuss expectations for recovery and prognosis. Surgery is usually performed directly after the surgeon’s examination and diagnosis. Recovery After Surgery Recovery times vary. Factors that influence the outcome, recovery time, and prognosis of surgical intervention include the severity of the spinal cord injury, duration of the compression, completeness of the surgical decompressive procedure, and severity of signs preceding surgery. Eighty to ninety percent of dogs that are paralyzed but still have deep pain walk again after surgery. For dogs without deep pain, the odds of recovery with surgery drop to about 50%, with worsening of this prognosis for those with longer periods of negative deep pain before surgery. Recovery of Sensation Some dogs show almost immediate improvement. For others, there may be no signs of improvement for two to three weeks before any change is noted. Usually, recovery in paralyzed dogs follows a standard pattern — the first improvement expected would be recovery of sensation if that was compromised before surgery. Voluntary Movement of Limbs and Tail/Recovery of Bladder and Bowel Control The next improvement expected is the ability to voluntarily (not just reflexively) move the limbs and tail. Once voluntary limb movement returns, bladder and bowel control usually follows. However, until your dog can voluntarily control going to the bathroom, a critically important part of patient care is bladder management to ensure the bladder is being emptied regularly and often. This may initially require in-hospital management, but eventually, owners are taught how to meet this need at home. Ability to Walk Following the ability to move the limbs will be the ability to walk. Initially, this may require some help. Your dog will appear uncoordinated, veering, falling, and stumbling on the top of their paws.  Even as strength improves, this lack of coordination (ataxia) may persist for quite some time. The nerves that send information to and from the brain that control fine coordination are the ones that take the longest to fully recover. Some dogs may be left with mild residual deficits in coordination. Formal Physical/Rehabilitation Therapy Many facilities offer formal physical and/or rehabilitation therapy staffed by veterinarians and nurses certified in these fields or physical therapists from the human field working under a veterinarian’s supervision. Patients recovering from spinal surgery will likely be referred to such a facility. While there may be core components to rehabilitating dogs after such surgery, programs are usually tailored to individual patient requirements and tolerance.

Category: TPLO (Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If your dog has been diagnosed with a torn cranial cruciate ligament, you will probably be considering surgical treatment options that may include a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO).  The procedure is tough enough to say, let alone understand!  The development of the TPLO is one of the most interesting stories in veterinary medicine. A basic summary of this history will help in understanding why the TPLO has generated so much controversy.  Descriptions of cranial cruciate ligament tears can be found for more than half a century in the veterinary literature.  Indeed, cruciate disease is the most common orthopedic problem in dogs.  In the early 1960s surgical techniques were developed to try and replace the damaged ligament or to eliminate the instability created in the stifle joint by tearing of it.  Some techniques worked better than others, but all had their drawbacks and none completely stabilized the injured joint or prevented the development of significant arthritis. Dr. Barclay Slocum, a surgeon who spent much of his career practicing in Eugene, Oregon, looked at the problem from a different perspective.  Dr. Slocum’s father was a human orthopedic surgeon who frequently did corrective osteotomy procedures to treat knee ligament problems in people.  In these procedures, the bones around the joint are cut and realigned to change abnormal forces within the knee.  With these procedures in mind, Dr. Slocum examined the canine knee from the perspective of the dynamic forces that occur during weight-bearing and movement when the cranial cruciate ligament is torn.  His examination of the dynamics combined with what was published in the veterinary literature in the early 1980s lead him to several conclusions.  First, he noted that the top surface of the tibia (shin bone) that works together with the femur (thigh bone) at the knee joint had a tibial slope.  Specifically, the top of the tibia slopes from front to back within the knee.  The angle of this slope varies between dogs from degrees in the high teens to clearly abnormal slopes over 35 or 40 degrees.  An average tibial plateau slope would be in the 21-24 degree range for most breeds.  Slocum noted that the cruciate ligament ran between the femur and tibia and acted to hold the end of the femur in place atop the tibial plateau.  He characterized the ligament as “a rope tying a wagon to the top of a hill.”  When the rope (ligament) is broken, the wagon (the end of the femur) tends to slide down the hill (the tibial plateau slope).  He characterized this instability, which had been named cranial tibial thrust, as the most important component of the dynamic instability that occurs in the stifle when the ligament tears.  Further, he theorized that previous surgeries had been attempts to “replace the rope” and had met with only fair success.  He wondered whether it might be more productive to “level the slope.”  Slocum went about achieving this goal in a few different ways before he settled on what we now refer to as the TPLO. Then he did a very interesting thing!  Whereas the age-old procedure in medical research has been that when a new technique is developed it is published in a scientific publication and presented at scholarly meetings to allow one’s peers to scrutinize the information, but Slocum didn’t follow that path.  Instead he patented the procedure and the equipment used to perform it.  His scholarly writings and lectures were short on specific details and he spent a good portion of the later part of his career teaching the procedure out of his veterinary practice.  Further, those he taught were required to sign contracts that they would not teach or publish details of the procedure to others.  To call the reaction to this approach a firestorm within the veterinary community would not be an overstatement.  The views of many concerning Slocum and the TPLO are colored by the controversy to this day. Dr. Slocum passed away in 2000.  His death had many important impacts on TPLO.  First, the patents on the procedure, its teaching, and the related surgical equipment all expired.  The result was that a great deal of independent research on the procedure began, in large part because many more surgeons were teaching and learning the procedure.  The other natural progression, humans being the innovative creatures that we are, was that several variations of the technique and equipment to perform the surgery started to appear. In recent years a number of other procedures have evolved.  These include tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA), closing wedge osteotomy (CWO), and triple tibial osteotomy (TTO).  All of these procedures can be thought of as different roads to the same destination.  That is, they all alter the angles within the stifle joint to neutralize the cranial tibial thrust that Slocum concentrated on in the 1980s.  All have their pluses and minuses and none has been shown to be superior to any of the others.  In most cases the procedure that may be recommended for your dog will have as much to do with what your veterinary surgeon is most comfortable with as any other factor. This article will deal only with the specifics of the TPLO. How is the TPLO performed? Before surgery, an x-ray of the stifle is taken to measure the angle at the top of the shin bone, called the tibial plateau angle.  The goal of the surgery is to reduce this angle so that dynamic joint instability (cranial tibial thrust) is eliminated.  This is usually accomplished by creating a post-surgical angle of between 4 and 10 degrees, an angle not much different than is found in the human knee.  In most cases the surgical procedure starts with an exploration of the inside of the stifle joint.  This can be done arthroscopically or with open joint surgery.  The purpose is to assess the meniscal cartilages for any possible damage.  Damaged cartilage must be removed if the dog is to regain normal pain-free function.  The TPLO procedure itself involves the use of a curved saw blade to make a curved cut on the inside, or medial, surface of the top of the tibia.  The cut top portion is then rotated to create the desired tibial plateau angle.  A stainless steel bone plate is then placed on the bone to hold the two pieces in their new alignment. Now that you know a bit about TPLO, let’s review some questions about the procedure. Q: Does My Dog Really Need Surgery?  I Read That They’ll Do Just Fine Without Surgery. A:Published data suggest that approximately 15% of dogs will recover reasonably good clinical function without surgery.  Most of those dogs will be small breeds, under 15-20 pounds of body weight.  Those that recover normal function tend to do so within 4-6 weeks after they first become lame.  For the majority of dogs, surgery is the only way to return them to good function, period…..not braces or medications or herbs or physical therapy or wishing or hoping! Q: Which Patients Will Benefit From TPLO? A:While the procedure can be performed on just about any patient, including small dogs and cats, TPLO seems to be most applicable to larger breed, active dogs.  Although some surgeons have differing opinions, most feel that smaller dogs will do equally well regardless of what procedure is performed.  In general, dogs weighing over 45 pounds (20 kg), especially if they are very active, will benefit the most from TPLO. Q: Why Is TPLO So Costly, Especially When Compared To Other Cruciate Repair Surgeries? A:TPLO requires specialized equipment including a motorized bone saw with a specially-designed curved blade, a surgical stainless steel bone plate and 6-9 bone screws, between 4-6 x-rays, a significant investment in training on the part of the surgeon, and up to 2-4 hours of preparation, surgical and recovery time for each patient. Q: What Aftercare Is Required? A:Individual surgeons approach this differently and there is no hard evidence to suggest what is best.  Some restrict post-operative patients from climbing stairs and encourage kenneling when the owners are not home to supervise their pet.  Others encourage leash walks and moderate exercise under the owner’s control.  Still others advocateactive physical rehabilitationbeginning immediately after surgery.  All will require follow-up x-rays at various stages to gauge healing of the cut in the bone.  Once bone healing is complete, then exercise can be gradually increased to normal. Q: What About Possible Complications? A:TPLO is a major surgery and complications are possible.  Published reports suggest the complication rates may be somewhat higher than with less invasive surgeries, but other factors may be involved including patient factors and surgeon experience with the procedure.  Most complications are minor in nature in that they can be resolved without additional surgery and have an ultimately successful outcome.  Included in this category would be things like infections and inflammation of the patellar tendon.  More major complications, including failure of plates or screws and fracture of the tibia or fibula, are uncommon.  The development of bone cancer many months or years later in the area of the surgery has been noted in a small number of TPLO dogs.  The possible connection of this cancer with the procedure is highly controversial as the top portion of the tibia is a common location for bone cancer in the dog even when no surgery or cruciate problem is a factor.  Whether the rate of such cancers in TPLO dogs is higher than normal is not clear.  One of the most common post-operative complications is not directly related to the TPLO procedure.  Tears of the meniscal cartilage in the stifle are a common consequence of an unstable joint.  Such tears may exist at the time of surgery and they can develop in up to 11% of patients after surgery.  That’s true in dogs and humans regardless of what kind of surgery they undergo.  Typically, these patients do well for weeks or months after surgery before suddenly becoming lame again. Q:Is TPLO Really Better Than Other Surgical Options? A:If your dog is larger, younger and active the answer is yes.  The data has not always been conclusive about this, however.  For a good part of the first 20-25 years after the development of TPLO, surgeons were faced with a paradox:  they were seeing significantly better results with TPLO than with other procedures they had used in large dogs….but the research data wasn’t backing up these observations.  Why?  Undoubtedly, Dr. Barclay Slocum’s decision to restrict availability of the procedure through patenting of the technique and equipment had a major effect on the amount of research that was done. In addition, one must realize that veterinary research is always more restricted in scope and numbers than is seen in human medicine.  TheNew England Journal of Medicinewill commonly publish studies involving tens or hundreds of thousands of human test subjects.  In veterinary medicine a study of 50 animals is a big study!  Why?  Money.  The difference in available research funds between human and veterinary medicine is astronomical, which probably isn’t surprising.  In the last few years, the research data is starting to confirm what surgeons have known all along:  TPLO dogs return to function faster, they develop less joint arthritis, and they tend to return to better functional levels than is seen with other techniques.  Although we can’t say for certain, it appears that these positive results also apply to other similar techniques such as TTA, CWO, and TTO.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Prenatal Care Preparing for your dog's labor and puppy care can be both exciting and fun; still, awareness of potential problems is of paramount importance. It is a good idea to keep track of your dog's breeding date so as to know when to expect what. We will first present some prenatal care suggestions, but for more details, read specifically aboutcare during pregnancy; you may wish to begin there. After about 35 days of pregnancy, the mother's nutritional needs will begin to increase. In general, she should require about twice as much food as usual, whereas when she begins nursing, she will need three times as much food. The best nutritional plan is to buy a dog food approved for growth (i.e., puppy food) and feed according to the package; such diets are balanced and require no supplementation, plus they typically have the extra calories needed by the pregnant or nursing mother. Exercise of the pregnant mother need not be restricted until after the first 4-6 weeks of pregnancy. Do not supplement calcium as this can cause metabolic imbalances; also, excess vitamins may be harmful to the puppies. Sometime around the 45thday, your dog should be examined by a veterinarian. At this time, the skeletons of the unborn pups will have mineralized and are thus going to be visible on an x-ray.  Your dog's abdomen should be x-rayed so that you know how many pups to expect. This is important as you will need to know when her labor is finished so you can be sure none of the puppies have been retained. Ultrasound may be used to confirm pregnancy much earlier (after 25 days, the embryonic heart may be seen beating), but it is more difficult to count the number of pups using this method. A general pregnancy blood test can be performed around day 35 just to confirm whether or not she is pregnant, but neither this nor ultrasound will tell you how many puppies to expect; only radiographs can do that. A comfortable area should be set aside for whelping (giving birth) and raising the puppies. The mother should feel at home here and should be able to come and go as she likes while the puppies must remain confined. It is important that the mother be isolated from all other dogs for three weeks prior to labor through three weeks after delivery to preventherpes infection. Herpes is spread by sniffing and licking between two dogs. Adult dogs rarely have any symptoms but the newborn or unborn puppies generally die. The dog's gestation period is considered to be 63 days, though this is not written in stone, and a normal range might be 58 to 68 days. Impending Labor When your dog's due date is approaching, you should begin monitoring her rectal temperature. When her temperature drops below 100°F (normal canine temperature is 101-102°F), labor may be expected within 24 hours. It is a good practice to know how to take your pregnant dog’s temperature as her due date approaches. Ask your veterinarian to show you how. The First Stage of Labor During this stage, uterine contractions begin. The mother will appear restless and may pace, dig, shiver, pant, or even vomit. This is all normal and all an owner can do is see that she has water available should she want it. This stage of labor is long, lasting 6 to 12 hours and culminates with full dilation of the cervix in preparation to expel a puppy. The Second and Third Stages of Labor Puppies are born covered in membranes that must be cleaned away or the pup will suffocate. The mother will bite and lick the membranes away. Allow her a minute or two after birth to do this; if she does not do it, then you must clean the pup for her. Simply remove the slippery covering and rub the puppy with a clean towel. The umbilical cord may be tied in a knot about one inch from the pup and cut with scissors on the far side of the knot. Be careful not to pull on the umbilical cord as this can injure the puppy. The mother may want to eat the placenta but this is probably not a good idea as vomiting it up later is common; it is best to clean away the placenta yourself. Expect one pup every 45 to 60 minutes with 10-30 minutes of hard straining. It is normal for the mother to take a rest partway through delivery and she may not strain at all for up to four hours between pups. If she is seen straining hard for over 30 minutes or if she takes longer than a 4-hour break, consult a veterinarian.  This is where it is important to know whether she has delivered the entire litter that was counted on the X-ray. Expect some puppies (probably half of them) to be born tail first, which is normal for dogs. Most of the time nature handles things according to plan and there are no complications. The important thing is to be prepared and know what constitutes a deviation from normal. During the delivery, a puppy can get stuck either because of size or positioning, the mom can get too tired or dehydrated to complete the mission without help, or any number of unexpected problems can arise. Problems can happen during the actual delivery or in the days following. Call your veterinarian if: It is normal for the mother to spike a fever in the 24 to 48 hours following birth. Clinical signs of illness should not accompany this fever. Normal vaginal discharge after giving birth should be odorless and may be green, dark red-brown or bloody and may persist in small amounts for up to 8 weeks. Green discharge is a bit special as this is the discharge indicating separation of a placenta from the uterus. During the birth of a litter, many placentas are separating so there will be plenty of green discharge. Where this becomes important is on the very first puppy, as when the first placenta separates, its associated puppy will need oxygen very soon, so a live puppy should appear within 30 minutes of seeing green discharge. If not, there is a problem, and you should consult a veterinarian. Problems to Watch for in the Following Days Metritis (Inflammation of the Uterus) Signs of this condition are as follows: If these signs are noted, usually in the first day or two postpartum, a veterinarian should be consulted. Your dog may have retained a placenta or have suffered some trauma during delivery. Animals who require assistance with delivery are often predisposed to metritis. She will likely need to be spayed. Eclampsia This condition results when the mother has trouble supporting the calcium demand of lactation and is a particular concern for toy breed dogs. Calcium supplementation predisposes a new mother to this condition. Usually affected animals are small dogs. They demonstrate: This progresses to: This condition generally occurs in the first three weeks of lactation and a veterinarian should be consulted immediately. Mastitis (Inflammation of the Breasts) Normal nursing glands are soft and enlarged. Diseased glands are red, hard, and painful. In general, the mother does not act sick; the disease is confined to the mammary tissue. The mother may be sore and discourage the pups from nursing; however, it is important to keep the pups nursing the affected glands. This is not harmful to the puppies and helps flush out the infected material. Warm compresses may be helpful. Agalactia (Not Producing Milk) Milk production and secretion (let down) is essential for the puppies' nutrition. If the puppies are nursing but it appears that milk is simply not flowing, there are a few simple things to try at home before going to the veterinarian. First, make sure the puppy room is not too warm and that the mother has plenty of food and water and that she seems to be healthy in other respects. If these issues seem controlled, the next step is to determine if milk is being produced and not "let down" or simply not being produced as different hormones are involved in each process. Your veterinarian will need to intercede with treatment for the mother. If the pups cannot so much as get colostrum, that all-important first milk that provides immunity from common infections, they may need to receive injections of canine plasma to replace the antibodies they did not get from their mother. Most dogs are excellent mothers and problems are few. The basic rule is to seek veterinary care if she seems to feel sick or if she ceases to care for her young. Puppies nurse until they are about six weeks old but can begin solid foods as early as four weeks of age. A good age for adoption to a new home is eight weeks or later.

Category: Effects of Spay and Neuter Timing on Cancer in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Even though veterinary recommendations forspayingandneuteringpets have become common and there is a lot of information available about its benefits, you may have questions or concerns about how it could affect your dog long term. You may also wonder if there is a correct age for spaying and neutering since recommendations seem to vary. This issue has been studied but there are no general recommendations because the decision is based on multiple factors. Here we explore the issues and emphasize that it is always best to consult your veterinarian regarding the best timing for your individual pet.       Decreased Mammary Cancer Besides the behavioral benefits seen with spaying and neutering, most studies cited for spaying dogs before their first heat emphasize the decreased risk of mammary gland tumors (both benign and malignant cancers). Several studies have concluded that female dogs are significantly less likely to develop mammary tumors when they are spayed and timing of the surgery relative to the dog's age makes a difference. The most protective effects were found with female dogs spayed prior to their first heat. Other Cancers On the other hand, there have been studies cited that discuss increased risk of other cancers when dogs are spayed young. These studies were done on a small number of relatively young dogs. Since the average age of diagnosis for mammary tumors is over 8 years, studies that looked at rates in younger dogs were unlikely to show the true incidence. These studies also examined the risk of other cancers developing, but they may have falsely exaggerated a non-existent effect, since studies with a relatively small group size are much more likely to be affected by chance. Another study found that age, not sexual status or timing of desexing, determined the probability of Golden Retrievers dying from cancer. This topic is complicated since the evidence is still inconsistent and contradictory from study to study. As a pet owner, you may be looking for concrete statements for or against desexing your pet, or regarding the timing of desexing. Various cancers have seemed more prevalent in desexed animals in some studies, but not in others, which makes it difficult to give concrete, unbiased recommendations. For example, the risk of osteosarcoma, mast cell tumor, lymphoma, urogenital cancer, and hemangiosarcoma may (or may not) increase when dogs are desexed prior to one year. Most of these studies are small (which can lead to inaccurate results) and many of the studies with these conclusions did not control for breeds predisposed to cancers, which they and others have identified as independent risk factors. Breed Specific Spay/Neuter Age Guidelines An analysis of multiple breeds was done by Hart and colleagues at UC Davis in 2020, and breed-specific guidelines for spay/neuter age were published. Critics of the breed-specific guidelines for spay/neuter age found the study to be problematic based on their methods, groupings, and means of applying analysis differently to different breeds. Although suggested guidelines for age of desexing of each breed examined were provided, the study did conclude that in most breeds examined, the risk of developing problems was not affected by age of neutering. Spayed/Neutered Dogs and Lifespans After reading this, you may be concerned that neutering or spaying your dog will cause long-term problems. However, it is important to note that multiple studies have looked at the impact of desexing on mortality from all causes and determined that desexed male and female dogs actually do have slightly longer median lifespans than their intact counterparts. Intact females had shorter lifespans than all other genders, and spayed females lived the longest. Even in a study that specifically looked at Golden Retrievers diagnosed with cancer, the spayed females lived longer than intact females. The best timing for spaying or neutering your pet may depend on other factors specific to your situation, such as your dog's behavioral tendencies (roaming, marking, aggression), environmental factors (housing, fencing, space), and the legal requirements of the jurisdiction where you live.This continues to be an evolving topic with many considerations. The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) issued reproductive control guidelines in 2024 that challenged traditional thinking regarding spaying and neutering and prompted varied reactions from veterinarians, particularly in the sheltering community.As with any medical decision, your best resource for determining the appropriate timing of spaying/neutering is your pet's veterinarian.

Category: False Pregnancy in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Veterinarians get a lot of questions about female dogs having their menstrual periods. Do dogs have menstrual periods? How long do they last? How often do they come? In fact, the menstrual cycle is a primate phenomenon; dogs do not have menstrual periods. They have an estrus cycle that includes a bloody vaginal discharge (hence the confusion about menstrual periods) and a period of false pregnancy. This false pregnancy, or pseudocyesis (pronounced “sudo-sigh-eesis”), can get out of control and last for weeks, with the dog producing milk and sometimes mothering soft toys or pillows like Rosie in the illustration. So what should you do when this happens? A Female Dog’s Normal Reproductive Cycle Before talking about treatment, let’s explain the dog’s natural estrus cycle. The female dog comes into season approximately every 6 to 8 months, though this period becomes more erratic with age and is somewhat irregular when cycles first begin, and can come at longer intervals in certain breeds. When female dogs get older (say, seven or older), they do not stop cycling; there is nothing similar to menopause. Instead, as mentioned, cycles become irregular and long periods of time (years) can pass between cycles.         The first phase of the cycle is calledproestrusand is characterized by a swollen vulva, a bloody vaginal discharge, and the attraction of male dogs. The female dog flirts with the male but will not allow him to mount. The bloody vaginal discharge is what seems to lead to the misconception that the dog is menstruating. In fact, the blood comes directly from the walls of the vagina rather than the sloughing of the uterine lining, as occurs in menstruation. The second phase of the cycle is calledestrus, which is characterized by the change in the character of the vaginal discharge from bloody to straw-colored. At this time, the female begins to allow the male to mount. It is classically the change from proestrus to estrus when ovulation occurs, and the female is most fertile. After the mating and the discharge is over, the period ofdiestrusbegins. The female is hormonally pregnant regardless of whether or not she is actually pregnant. During this time, progesterone is produced by a structure in the ovary called the corpus luteum. This structure is created in the process of ovulation when the ova (eggs) are released. If the dog is pregnant, other hormones will eventually take over to maintain the corpus luteum for the entire 63 days of the pregnancy. When the puppies are ready for birth, the corpus luteum is rapidly destroyed in a completely different hormonal sequence of events. If she is not pregnant, the corpus luteum will simply wear out gradually and she will go back into the period of hormonal inactivity in which she spends the bulk of her time. This process of the corpus luteum wearing out in the absence of pregnancy takes at least 70 days, starting at the time of ovulation. Remember, during the 70+ days she has an active corpus luteum, her body essentially thinks she is pregnant and proceeds accordingly. All the hormones are present; only the puppies are missing. If she is actually pregnant, the corpus luteum lasts through the 63 days of pregnancy. When the puppies are ready for birth, the corpus luteum is rapidly destroyed in a completely different hormonal sequence of events. Because the female dog is hormonally pregnant for 70 days after ovulation, one could say false pregnancy is a normal part of the cycle. We only treat it as a disease when it becomes extreme or fails to resolve naturally. Clinical False Pregnancy When false pregnancy persists, it can be a nuisance. The female dog can show the following signs: Some female dogs are very sensitive to the hormonal fluctuations of their cycle. Diagnosis is made by history and physical examination rather than by blood test (though a blood test can be used to determine if she is actually pregnant or not). The key is to find symptoms of pregnancy in a female dog who is not pregnant. Symptoms generally become noticeable 6 to 12 weeks after estrus. Treatment If symptoms are mild, treatment is unnecessary as the condition resolves within three weeks. It may be tempting to put warm compresses on the breasts or wrap them to prevent milk leakage in the house, but in reality, any manipulation of the mammary tissue perpetuates milk production. It is important to minimize tactile stimulation. If the female is licking herself, she may need an Elizabethan collar to minimize stimulation. Any stimulation of the mammary tissue leads her body to think puppies are nursing, and milk production will continue. If a more aggressive approach is needed, a diuretic such as furosemide can be prescribed. The idea is that mild dehydration will end the lactation. Some people may want to try water deprivation, but this is potentially dangerous and should not be attempted without specific veterinary guidance. If the above medication does not work, hormonal medications can be used. Progesterone can be used, but after the course of medication is complete, the false pregnancy recurs, so this is not a good choice. Estrogens are also not a good choice as they bring the dog back into estrus (vaginal discharge, attracting males, etc.). A week’s course of the male hormone mibolerone has generally been successful, but this medication is no longer available. Hormones that inhibit prolactin (the hormone of milk production) are currently the best choices when medications are needed. Bromocriptine can be obtained from a compounding pharmacy and is given until lactation ceases (about a week or two). An upset stomach is not unusual with this medication. Cabergoline has fewer side effects and is given similarly but tends to be more expensive. Both these medications will cause abortion if the dog actually turns out to be pregnant, so it is important to be sure. A third medication called metergoline works a little differently to reduce prolactin but can also be used to end false pregnancy. Approximately 4-5 days of treatment are needed to stop the lactation and get things back to normal. Supplementing with vitamin B6 has been found to be helpful in regressing the false pregnancy as well. A blood test can reliably detect canine pregnancy after 30 days from the breeding date. Ask your veterinarian about this test if you are not sure whether your dog is pregnant. Spay during False Pregnancy? It might seem like a good idea to spay the female to end the false pregnancy, as spaying will remove the ovaries and the corpora lutea they carry. Unfortunately, this does not end the prolactin production from the pituitary gland so spaying may actually prolong the false pregnancy. Spaying during the diestrus period described above can actually trigger a false pregnancy. It is best to wait until the false pregnancy is over and then spay her to prevent future episodes. It is best to spay well after the 70-day diestrus period to avoid triggering a false pregnancy.

Category: Follicular Cysts in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What are follicular cysts in dogs? Follicular cysts are large bumps, or nodules, on a dog’s skin. They are one of many types of bumps, or skin masses, that dogs can have. Follicular cysts get their name because they start from the hair follicle. They may ooze a thick white, yellow, or brown material and may become itchy or painful as they grow in size. Usually only one follicular cyst is seen, but rarely some dogs have many at the same time. They are also known as: Isthmus or tricholemmal cyst: isthmus-catagen cystInfundibular cyst: epidermoid cyst, epidermal inclusion cyst, sebaceous cyst, wenMatrical cystHybrid cyst: mixed cyst, panfollicular cyst How are follicular cysts diagnosed? Your veterinarian will take skin samples and examine them under the microscope. Your veterinarian may start by taking a small sample from the skin mass using a needle, which is called a fine needle aspirate. Especially if the follicular cyst is growing or painful, your veterinarian may remove the entire mass in a surgery (biopsy). How are follicular cysts treated? Follicular cysts do not spread beyond the skin but can becomeinfected. If this happens, your veterinarian may take a sample for skin culture (bacterial culture and sensitivity) to choose an appropriate antibiotic (a drug that fights bacteria). If a follicular cyst grows in size and becomes itchy or painful, your veterinarian may recommend surgery. A follicular cyst will not regrow after it is removed.

Category: MRSP Dogs and Spaying
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English This is an increasingly common question, as methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus pseudintermedius(MRSP – essentially the canine version of the high-profile human "superbug" MRSA) has expanded greatly in the canine population. As more dogs get MRSP infections and even more become inapparent carriers of this bug, more dogs that are carriers will need surgery (both elective and non-elective).  Since MRSP is now a leading cause of surgical site infections in dogs, there’s concern about what to do with these carriers, particularly when it comes to elective surgeries like spays and neuters. My answer to the question is… maybe. If the dog has an active MRSP infection (e.g. skin infection), I’d say "hold off for a while" if possible. I don’t like elective surgeries being done on animals with active infections (this applies to almost any kind of infection, not just MRSP). If an animal has an active MRSP infection, it might increase the risk of the surgical site becoming infected because of the greater overall burden of MRSP on the skin and elsewhere. If the dog doesn’t have an active infection (e.g. is a healthy carrier after having gotten over a previous MRSP infection), I’d say "go ahead." Here’s why: So, if infections are rare, despite the fact thatS. pseudintermediusis present on pretty much all dogs and that we don’t use drugs to killS. pseudintermediusduring (or after) spays, there should be no added risk of infection by the antibiotic-resistant version of this bug. Every dog is carrying lots of different bacteria that can cause an infection at any time. That’s why we use a variety of surgical antisepsis practices (e.g. clipping, scrubbing, sterile instruments, proper operating room) to help prevent a critical number of bacteria from getting into the sterile surgical site where they can start to cause problems. This strategy doesn’t necessarily apply to surgeries where antibiotics are used prophylactically (preventive) and where staph are the main causes of infection, especially in situations like orthopedic procedures where MRSP infections are common and can be very hard to treat. What to do in those cases with an MRSP-positive animal is a tougher question, and we’re working on an answer to it at the moment.

Category: Recessed Vulva in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A recessed (or juvenile) vulva means a dog has excess skin folds that hang over her vulva, enough to potentially cause problems of one kind or another. The skin folds are a structural problem thought to possibly be a genetic issue, but the genetic connection has not been determined. The condition tends to be seen mostly in medium to large-sized breeds, most often in obese dogs. Some dogs will never have one single problem related to having a recessed vulva, and it will be found during a physical exam or during a procedure for something unrelated. However, some dogs will have life-long problems because the vulvar area collects some moisture when the dog urinates. Combined with body heat in that area, the moisture creates a perfect breeding ground for bacteria and predisposes the dog tourinary tract infectionsorvaginitis. The vagina is normally not sterile. The bacteria can infect the skin folds, which is called perivulvar dermatitis, move into the vagina causing vaginitis, or move up into the urinary tract, which leads to a bladder infection. Your veterinarian can diagnose a recessed, or hooded, vulva simply by looking at the genital area, and the vulva is not seen because it’s covered with skin folds. Clinical signs tend to depend on how much inflammation and infection the dog has. Your dog may scoot on her behind, trying to relieve the itching in her vulva (it may look like a dog scooting because ofinflamed anal glands),or licking her vulva excessively. You may notice a bad odor from her vulva; that odor is usually from infected tissues. Some dogs might leak urine while sleeping or resting due to a condition called USMI, which is a common problem in spayed dogs and could also potentially contribute to a bladder infection (bacterial cystitis). If she has a bladder infection, you may see blood in her urine, accidents in the house even if she is perfectly housetrained, see her straining to urinate, or notice a foul odor from her urine. It’s possible that her signs of a bladder infection are the only ones you will see if she has a recessed vulva. Overall, bacterial cystitis is a common medical problem for female spayed dogs (in general) in that many of them may have a bout of bacterial cystitis during their lifetime. Repeated or recurrent bouts of bacterial cystitis are more problematic and it’s important to look for underlying drivers. A recessed vulva could be one of these predisposing causes.  Treatment If the skin folds of the recessed vulva are affecting both your and your dog’s quality of life, your veterinarian can provide medical management or a surgical fix. Medicated shampoos or wipes may be enough to prevent skin infections. In overweight dogs, weight loss will likely help because there would be less tissue to fold over the vulva. If your dog has not gone through a heat cycle, the recessed vulvamightimprove after the first heat cycle. The surgical procedure is called a vulvoplasty. Prior to surgical intervention, it’s important to investigate and look for co-morbid causes for recurrent bacterial cystitis. The evaluation typically includes a physical examination, complete urinalysis, urine culture, possibly a complete blood count, and a chemistry panel. Imaging with radiographs (X-rays) and a complete abdominal ultrasound are also likely to be done. Direct visualization of the lower urinary tract and vagina can be performed with cystoscopy, and this is often done prior to vulvoplasty surgery in order to look for problems such as malformations and other abnormalities. During vulvoplasty, the surgeon removes a piece of tissue from around the vulva so that the skin has a more normal structure. The new ventilation helps the skin dry out and not be moist enough all the time for bacteria to grow. Additionally, it keeps those skin folds from rubbing up against each other and causing irritation. You may be provided with analgesics for pain and possibly antibiotics to prevent an infection. Some dogs will need sutures; most types will need to be removed in about 10-14 days at the follow-up appointment. Before the vulvoplasty occurs, any skin infection near the vulva must be cleared up as it prevents the incision from healing normally, usually by taking antibiotics. A skin culture can determine the most appropriate antibiotic. Appropriate post-operative care is critical: for two weeks she must be kept quiet with restricted activity, as otherwise during running, jumping, and playing the incision can rip open. That can cause some serious complications. She should be taken outside only on a leash. Ane-collarneeds to stay on so she will not lick the incision, which also can cause infections. Rarely, in dogs with significant skin folds, it is possible that not enough skin is removed during the procedure. In this case, the symptoms will likely return. A second surgery can correct it. Generally, however, the prognosis after a vulvoplasty is excellent and most owners are quite pleased.

Category: The Canine Estrous Cycle: Being in Heat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  The canine estrous cycle, or what we think of as "being in heat,"hasfour phases called proestrus, estrus,diestrus, and anestrus. Proestrus Proestrus is normally thought of as the beginning of the estrous cycle. During proestrus, estrogen is produced by the ovaries, which results in a bloody discharge from the vulva and swelling of the vulva. Proestrus can last a few days to several weeks but, on average, lastsabout10-14 days. During proestrus,femalesmay attract males, buttheyare not receptive to breeding. Estrus At the end of proestrus, there is a sudden, brief rise in luteinizing hormone (LH). Thisriseis referred to as the LH surge. The LH hormone works with the ovaries to cause thefolliclesto release their eggs. The LH surge marks the beginning of estrus, which is the next phase of the estrous cycle. Estrus is the phase in whichfemaleswill allow themselves to be bred. Ovulation occurs during estrus, and ifsheis bred,the eggs are also fertilized during estrus.Estrus is characterized hormonally by a rise in progesterone andadecline in estrogen. Estrus lasts about one week. Proestrus and estrus together are referred to as the “heat cycle.” The first heat cycle occurs whenfemalesreach about 2/3 of their adult size (six to 18 months of age), with some notable differences. Sighthounds likegreyhounds,borzoi, and Afghan hounds may not have their first heat cycle untilthey arewell over two yearsold.Any femalewill have heat cycles throughout their life unless they are spayed. During a spay, the ovaries are removed. Without the ovaries,theydo not produce estrogen or progesterone and do not come into heat anymore. Mostfemalesare spayed to prevent heat cycles and pregnancies as well as to prevent common reproductive diseases likepyometra(pus in the uterus). Diestrus Diestrus followsestrus. Diestrus is characterized by high levels of progesterone whether or notsheis pregnant. Elevated progesterone levels are necessary to maintain pregnancy, and high progesterone levels are responsible for some of the physical and behavioral changes seen during diestrus, including mammary gland enlargement, increased appetite, and milk production. Diestrus lasts two months ifsheis pregnant and can last a little longer (2.5 months) if she is not pregnant. The non-pregnant diestrus is also called afalse pregnancyor pseudopregnancy. At the end of diestrus, progesterone levels return to baseline. Anestrus The final phase of the estrous cycle is anestrus. If your dog gives birth to puppies, she will produce milk and rear her puppies during anestrus. This is the stage in which the uterus recovers and repairs itself in preparation for the next heat cycle. Anestrus is characterized by low progesterone and low estrogen. Anestrus can last for two to 10 months, with an average of four months. The normal estrous cycle repeats every six months with a range from four to 12 months. Some breeds, including Basenji and Tibetan mastiff,are known for only having one heat cycle in the fall each year. Currently, there are three procedures most performed under the term “spay”. Your veterinarian may perform an "ovariohysterectomy" (referred to as OVH), which removes the ovaries, uterine body, and uterine horns. Another choice is ovariectomy (OVE), in which only the ovaries are removed. Your veterinarian may perform a hysterectomy, removing the uterus only and leaving the ovaries. Discuss with your veterinarian which option would be best for your dog, and why. If you prefer that your female dog does not have puppies, speak to your veterinarian about the best ageto spay her. If you dowantyour dog to have puppies,ask your veterinarian whatmedical care to expect and when.If your dog is a purebred,breed clubs can help guide you about what to expect.

Category: Transmissible Venereal Tumors in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Imagine a tumor that can be transmitted by touch. For dogs, this is not a matter of imagination; the transmissible venereal tumor has been described since 1876, and is not unusual where stray dogs roam free and have contact with one another. The tumor is found in both male and female dogs. Transmission is by simple physical contact between an existing tumor on one dog and abrasions on a mucous membrane (oral, genital, nasal, etc.) on another. It is most commonly spread during mating but can also be spread during routine sniffing or other contact. In most cases, tumor growth is found on the genitals, but it can also just as easily affect noses, mouths, anal areas, and other anatomical sites. The transmissible venereal tumor, affectionately known as the TVT, may be visible as an external fleshy growth or may simply appear as genital bleeding (eventually, the tumor will become eroded on the surface). As mentioned, the tumor is common where there are large numbers of roaming dogs or in shelters. In most cases the tumor is not malignant and simply grows and bleeds at a local site and is eventually rejected by the patient’s immune system; however, resolution of the tumor can take over 9 months, which is a long time for a patient to bear a bloody infected growth.  In approximately 10% of patients, the tumor does spread malignantly in a cancerous fashion though this is more likely in dogs that have an immunological compromise (young age, poor general health, concurrent other disease). Because of the long time to resolve and the potential for spread, treatment is generally recommended over simply allowing the tumor to regress. Strangely, the tumor cells are not the patient's own cells transformed into cancer cells. This is not a matter of a virus being transmitted that causes normal cells to become cancerous. The TVT is actually a tumor that grafts itself from one dog's body onto another dog's body. Unlike the host's normal cells, TVT cells have a completely different number of chromosomes and do not originate from the host at all. Developing a TVT might be analogous to getting bitten by a mosquito, and the few mosquito cells left behind try to grow a new mosquito on the host's body. Diagnosis is made either by biopsy (taking a small piece of tumor tissue for analysis) or by cytology (obtaining a smear of the tumor's cells and looking at it under a microscope, as shown above). The TVT is one of several tumors classified as a "Round Cell Tumor." Biopsy samples are more accurate, whereas a smear exam might only indicate that the growth in question is a Round Cell Tumor without being more specific. Treatment Treatment of the transmissible venereal tumor is straightforward and generally quite rewarding. Surgery Surgery is not as effective as one would expect. In one study of 70 dogs, 22 percent had recurrence within 5 months. If a tumor is surgically removed and found to be a transmissible venereal tumor, one of the other treatment methods should ensue. Vincristine Vincristineis a chemotherapy agent that must be delivered intravenously. Intravenous (IV) catheters or butterfly units are placed to deliver the drug, as any spill into the tissue surrounding the vein results in a painful tissue slough (i.e., a chemical burn occurs). This, however, is the only serious risk in this treatment, and as long as proper IV materials are used, this complication is rare. The TVT responds after only one or two treatments, but generally, 3 to 6 weekly treatments are given to ensure a cure. There is some evidence that the treatment course is shortened when an appropriate canine non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) is added to the regimen. Doxorubicin Doxorubicin, also called by the brand name Adriamycin, is another chemotherapy agent that must be given intravenously. It is a bit more intensive in its chemotherapeutic properties compared to vincristine but if vincristine is ineffective or yields only partial results, doxorubicin may be used to complete therapy. Radiation External beam radiation is effective in curing the TVT but is expensive and not readily available. If you are near a facility, however, this may be a good option. This dog (called Fannie Mae) lived behind the Thong Sala market in Thailand and was fed by the people there. She contracted a transmissible venereal tumor in her wanderings. These photos show the tumor and the results after two vincristine treatments. See a more complete history of Fannie Mae from thePhaNgan Animal Care, Koh PhaNgan Suksa School, a non-profit organization based in Wok Tum, Koh PhaNgan, Thailand.

Category: Vaginitis in Puppies
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Puppy vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina that occurs in puppies. Most cases occur between the ages of 6 weeks and 8 months. Puppy vaginitis usually resolves when the puppy matures and goes through her first estrus, although some cases may not improve.Most puppies don’t show any signs, but others may have sticky, cloudy, white/yellow discharge (the amount will vary), and crusty hair around the vulva. Puppies may lick their vulva a lot and develop skin irritation and inflammation. The signs are not necessarily constant. The episodes can occur intermittently, and can last for weeks to months.Although puppy vaginitis is fairly common, your veterinarian may recommend diagnostic tests (e.g. microscopic examination of the discharge, physical examination, CBC, diagnostic imaging, etc.) to help determine if the discharge is actually benign puppy vaginitis or the result of a more significant problem, such as bladder infection, abnormal urinary tract anatomy, hooded/inverted/recessed vulva, foreign body, etc. Bladder infection, abnormal urinary tract anatomy, foreign body, etc. usually require medical or surgical treatment. Hooded/inverted/recessed vulva can be common in puppies that haven't undergone estrus; there are two main treatments for this vulvar problem. One is letting the puppy go through an estrous cycle in the hope that the vulva will mature and change shape. The second is performing an episiotomy/vulvoplasty to surgically change the vulva's shape.Basic, uncomplicated puppy vaginitis is usually more of an annoyance than a true medical problem. The important thing is to differentiate between it and a more serious problem.A major part of treatment for puppy vaginitis is time and patience. You have to wait for her to go through puberty. Once the puppy has had an estrus cycle, the problem usually resolves. You can help prevent skin irritation by keeping the skin around her vulva clean by using such items as wet baby wipes, damp paper towels, etc.Your veterinarian will know what treatment might best help your particular puppy.

Category: What To Expect When Your Dog Is in Season
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  Whether you are planning on breeding your dog or having her spayed, if you’ve never gone through it before, it’s good to know what to expect if she goes into season. This is known medically asestrus, and known colloquially as being “in heat”. If you are planning on breeding, this is a subject that is best discussed with your veterinarian beforehand. This article is written with the non-breeder in mind. Let’s assume you’ve brought your female puppy home and planned on having her spayed, but for one reason or another, the first window of opportunity was missed, and she has gone into her first season. Dogs usually reach this milestone around six months of age. Smaller breeds may experience estrus sooner, and larger breeds may have a delay in their first season until they are a month or so older, but if you do want to have your female dog spayed before her first estrus, think about making the appointment before her six-month birthday. Dogs go into season roughly twice a year, every six to seven months. The estrous cycle has four stages. You won’t be expected to remember the medical terms for them, so let’s think of them as beginning, middle, end, and resting time. Proestrus: (beginning) What You Can Expect Your Dog to Experience: The vaginal discharge varies from dog to dog but can be heavy and bright red. If you have never experienced a female in season, this discharge can be alarming. Some dogs will keep themselves quite clean during this time, and some dogs won’t. Be prepared to keep her in an area that is easy for you to clean. Doggy diapers are available, but keep in mind diapers won’t keep her from being bred. Dogs determined to fall in love will find a way, and a paper barrier is not going to stop them. This stage usually lasts seven to 10 days but can last up to four weeks. She will go into the estrus stage next: Estrus: (middle)What You Can Expect Your Dog to Experience: Pheromones from a female dog in season can be detected by male dogs from a long distance. Prepare for the onslaught if there are loose dogs in your neighborhood. When taking her out, make sure you have her on a strong leash and would be able to handle her should a male dog approach her. Doggy social gathering places like dog parks are not a great idea at this time. Your sweet little girl may be very eager to make new friends. She has suddenly become very popular, and she likes it. To prevent accidental breeding, keep her on a leash when away from home, and don’t leave her in the yard alone even if she’s fenced in. Even if a male dog can’t get in, females have been known to dig out or jump a fence during this time. Don’t let her surprise you or take a chance on losing her. The estrus stage lasts about nine days but can be as long as three weeks. Diestrus: (end, thank goodness!)What You Can Expect Your Dog to Experience: If your female was bred during her heat, this is the gestational period (pregnancy). Canine gestation lasts approximately 58 to 63 days. If you suspect that she might be pregnant, consult with your veterinarian as soon as possible. Diestrus lasts about two months. Your girl will be going through all kinds of hormonal changes during this time, but you probably won’t know it. If you are interested in the medical terms and technical bits, read Veterinary Partner’s articleThe Canine Estrous Cycle: Being in Heat. Anestrus (let’s take a break) The final stage isanestrus. This is the resting time between breeding cycles and lasts about six months until your female goes into her next proestrus cycle. Avoiding estrus can be medically important, as dogs that have gone through one or more estrous cycles have a greatly increased risk of mammary (breast) cancer, and older female dogs who are not spayed often get life-threatening uterine infections known as pyometra. Spending a small amount for a spay surgery at the right time can help save your dog – and save you thousands of dollars on complex and dangerous medical expenses. If you plan on having her spayed, remember you have about six months. It may be a good idea to call your veterinary clinic and make your girl’s appointment in plenty of time.

Category: Chronic Bronchitis in Dogs is Neither Infectious nor Contagious
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Definition and Causes Chronic bronchitisis usually a non-infectious, inflammatory condition affecting the lining (mucosa) of the large airways (the trachea and bronchi) that results in a cough on most days for more than two months. In most cases, the specific cause of chronic bronchitis in dogs is not identified.  Chronic bronchitis is neither infectious nor contagious to other dogs; dogs will not pass it on to other dogs as they can in the acute form (see below). Acute bronchitis, on the other hand, is most often caused by infectious agents, such as viruses (e.g. parainfluenza virus, adenovirus,canine influenza virus,distemper virus, or bacterial agentsBordetella bronchisepticais the most common).  It is commonly termed kennel cough or canine infectious tracheobronchitis. Inflammation can also be caused by noxious irritants such as second hand smoke, foreign bodies, allergens (similar to hay fever in humans), foods allergens, and either migrating or primary lung parasites. In many of these cases, this acute bronchitis, occurring at the time of the infection or insult, will resolve with appropriate therapy from your veterinarian.  However, if the bronchitis persists long enough – generally, more than a few months – it is labeled chronic, and the cough itself can begin to cause and perpetuate airway inflammation. Clinical Signs Dogs with chronic bronchitis generally have a persistent hacking cough.  Some people describe it as sounding like a goose honking.  However, any trachea-bronchial inflammation/irritation can produce a similar sounding cough.  Often, the coughing occurs during the night or when the dog first starts to move around upon waking.  It also commonly occurs with excitement or exercise. Diagnosis Chronic bronchitis is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Other diseases can cause clinical signs similar to chronic bronchitis.  These includetracheal collapse,laryngeal paralysis, lung diseases, lung cancer,heart failure,heartworm diseaseand infectious causes of acute bronchitis (listed above).  Your veterinarian will likely attempt to rule out many of these causes with a history, physical examination, and additional testing. Diagnostic tests that are used to establish a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis include chest x-rays (thoracic radiographs), airway endoscopy (passing a small camera into the larynx, trachea and bronchi), collecting samples from the lower airways for culture and analysis of the cells in the airways (broncho-alveolar lavage or a transtracheal washing), and sometimes even echocardiography (examining the heart using ultrasound).  A fecal analysis might be needed to rule out parasites. Treatment Once a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis is made, your veterinarian will generally treat this condition with a variety of medications. There are several things to remember about treating chronic bronchitis: Treatment of chronic bronchitis generally relies on using a combination of medications: Your veterinarian might prescribe a combination of these drugs, and alter the doses as the disease is controlled to minimize side effects while still maintaining good control of the coughing. An important factor in successful therapy of chronic bronchitis is weight loss.  If your pet is overweight, a loss of even 5-10% of the body weight can dramatically improve the coughing.  When the dog is overweight, improving your dog’s condition is completely in your hands; therefore, your veterinarian might prescribe a weight-loss program for your pet in addition to the medications. Your veterinarian might also ask you to keep a “coughing log” to keep track of the severity and frequency of coughing, as this can help determine how successful the treatment is. Prognosis The prognosis for treating chronic bronchitis is good.  However, because this condition generally occurs in older dogs, other causes of chronic coughing (listed above) might complicate the management.  If coughing persists or recurs despite appropriate therapy, your veterinarian might be required to pursue other causes, or refer you to a specialist for additional diagnostic tests.

Category: Electronic Cigarettes are Toxic to Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Electronic cigarettes, often called e-cigs, are marketed as an alternative to cigarette smoking.  They are also referred to as personal vaporizers or electronic nicotine delivery systems. These devices have a cylindrical body that holds a cartridge containing a liquid solution; some resemble tobacco cigarettes.  The solution, termed “e-liquid” or “e-juice,” contains a base material, flavoring compounds, and nicotine. The base material is generally propylene glycol and either vegetable glycerin or polyethylene glycol. Glycerin and propylene glycol are of low toxicity when eaten, but the amount in the refill bottles (usually 10-30% of what's in the bottle) is low enough to not be much of a concern; nicotine is the bigger issue. Whether any of the compounds used are toxic if inhaled long term is not known. The nicotine levels in these e-liquids can vary in concentration from being completely nicotine-free up to 36 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) of nicotine. For marketing purposes, the “/mL” part is frequently dropped, and the e-liquids are advertised as having X mg of nicotine rather than X mg/mL. In some e-cigs, the user controls the amount of nicotine delivered by adjusting the flow of e-liquid from the cartridge. An e-cig with a full cartridge can contain up to 36 mg of nicotine, which doesn’t sound like a lot until you factor in how toxic nicotine is.  Clinical signs of nicotine poisoning can be seen in dogs and cats exposed to a mere 0.5 mg per pound of body weight.  For cats and small dogs, ingesting 20 mg of nicotine can be lethal. Even more dangerous are the bottles of e-liquid that are used to recharge the e-cig cartridge: the nicotine in these bottles can range from 10 mL to 60 mL or more.  So a 30-mL bottle of 36 mg/mL e-liquid will contain 1080 mg of nicotine, more than enough to prove fatal for even a very large dog if the contents are ingested. Nicotine is readily absorbed by ingestion as well as through the skin.  Pets may be exposed when they chew up the e-cigs or the bottles containing e-juice or even when they walk through puddles of spilled e-juice and get it on their paws.  The signs of nicotine poisoning may begin within 15 to 30 minutes of exposure to the e-liquid; in contrast, signs of nicotine poisoning following eating tobacco products may take a few hours as the nicotine must be released from the tobacco. The first signs normally seen with toxic exposure to nicotine include: With severe intoxications, signs may progress to include: Further progression of signs may result in profound weakness, paralysis, abnormal heart rhythms (including cardiac arrest), hypotension, coma, and death. Prompt and aggressive veterinary care is required to successfully manage poisoning from e-juice exposure.  Because the e-juice is rapidly absorbed across the mucous membranes of the mouth, standard decontamination measures such as inducing vomiting are usually not helpful.  Treatment includes managing convulsions and seizures, treating heart and blood pressure abnormalities, ensuring adequate respiration, and providing intravenous fluids to enhance nicotine elimination.The prognosis for patients exposed to large amounts of nicotine can be quite grave depending on how quickly veterinary care is obtained, and even with aggressive veterinary care, some patients will not survive.

Category: Intervention for Choking in an Unconscious Dog
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Current treatment for choking (airway obstruction) in dogs includes performing the Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts), removal with forceps, performing a finger sweep (in an unconscious patient), or rescue breathing. Advanced airway techniques (surgical cricothyrotomy) may be an option in a veterinary clinic, or with adequate prehospital training in the field. The eXternal eXtraction Technique™ (XXT™) is a safer, more effective treatment/intervention for choking in an unconscious dog.The authors do not have experiential evidence using this technique in cats. Although true choking (complete airway obstruction) has been considered uncommon, the authors are aware of many reported cases of fatal airway obstructions during training or play sessions. There are also reports of pet owners suffering injuries including finger amputations attempting to retrieve an object from the back of a dog’s throat. Working dogs are particularly high risk due to their high drive and intense focus on rewards. Prevention Choking on a ball or similar object may be avoided by adequate safety precautions. The size and shape of toys and ball rewards should be evaluated before offering them to your pet. Balls and Kongs should be checked for damage, cracks, etc. Supervision is recommended for balls, Kongs, and chews.  XXT™ PullGrip Alternative It is valuable to know that there is also an alternate approach to the eXternal eXtraction technique. The PullGrip approach should not be used unless the dog can be placed in a stabilized position with its head in an “In-Line Position” with the airway parallel to the floor -- nose, ears, and spine all in a line. This alternate technique may be more effective for responders with reduced thumb strength. Indications  Step 1: Starting Body Position A. "Brace the Back" against the floor and straddle the dog in a supine position.  B. Position the head in "In-Line Position" with the airway parallel to the floor.  Step 2: Identify Landmarks A. Feel the ball.  Step 3: Starting Hand Position: Open Diamond A. Thumbs  B. Middle Fingers  C. Index Fingers  Step 4: PUSH HARD!! J-Stroke  Step 5: If breathing does not return spontaneously, provide 2 mouth-to-snout rescue breaths. Step 6: If the patient does not respond,begin CPR. Step 7: Seek veterinary care immediately.  Indications  Step 1: Starting Body Position A. If possible, have an assistant stabilize the dog on their back. The responder will position themselves in front of the dog facing their snout.  B. Position the head in "In-Line Position" with the airway parallel to the floor.  Step 2: Identify Landmarks A. Feel the ball.  Step 3: Starting Hand Position: Open Diamond A. Thumbs B. Fingers  Step 4: PULL HARD!! J-Stroke  Step 5: If breathing does not return spontaneously, provide 2 mouth-to-snout rescue breaths Step 6: If the patient does not respond,begin CPR.

Category: Laryngeal Paralysis in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English See article Summary below: Most of us know the larynx is commonly known as the voice box and is located in the throat. We know that laryngitis is a condition where one cannot speak, but other than that, the larynx does not get much thought. It is a vastly under-appreciated organ. The larynx is not just where the sound comes from; it is, more importantly, the cap of the respiratory tract's tubing. The larynx closes the respiratory tract off while we eat and drink so that we do not inhale our food. If we need to take a deep breath, the muscles of the larynx expand and open for us. The larynx is the guardian of the airways, keeping whatever we want to swallow out and directing air in. Laryngeal paralysis results when the abductor muscles of the larynx cannot work properly. This means no expanding and opening of the larynx for a deep breath; the laryngeal folds simply flop weakly and flaccidly. In other words, when you need a deep breath, you don't get one. This can create tremendous anxiety. imagine attempting to take a deep breath and finding that you simply cannot. Anxiety leads to more rapid, deep breathing attempts and more distress. A respiratory crisis from the partial obstruction can emerge, creating an emergency and even death. Laryngeal paralysis does not come about suddenly. For most dogs, there is a fairly long history of panting, easily tiring on walks, or loud raspy breathing. Ideally, the diagnosis can be made before the condition progresses to an emergency. Dogs with laryngeal paralysis demonstrate some or all of the following signs: The usual patient is an older, large breed dog; the most commonly affected breed is the Labrador retriever. The condition can occur in cats but is rare. The Bouvier des Flandres has a hereditary form of laryngeal paralysis that is able to affect young dogs. Other breeds reported to have early onset genetic laryngeal paralysis include Siberian Husky, Great Pyrenees, bull terrier, and Dalmatian. Is Laryngeal Paralysis Part of a Bigger Neurologic Problem? The time for ambiguity regarding this question has passed, and the answer is a definite yes. Laryngeal paralysis is now considered to be the first symptom of a much more pervasive neurologic weakness, hence the new name of the condition, "Geriatric Onset Laryngeal Paralysis and Polyneuropathy." In time, the leg muscles will become weak and uncoordinated, leading to debilitating mobility problems. In addition, the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) will lose normal function, creating a risk of inhalation of food material. This can progress to a completely flaccid esophagus called a megaesophagus, a condition that requires high maintenance management to prevent aspiration pneumonia and provide proper food delivery. The good news is that the average patient with acquired laryngeal paralysis is at least 10 years old and the progression of the neurologic weakness is fairly slow. This means many patients will live their normal lifespan before further neurologic weakness becomes a problem. We can still say, however, that dogs with laryngeal paralysis are 21 times more likely to develop a megaesophagus than dogs without laryngeal paralysis. Also, if one knows that progressive muscle weakness is coming, one can be proactive with exercise and physical therapy to help maintain mobility as long as possible. It's been suggested thathypothyroidismmay be a cause of laryngeal paralysis. In fact, it is not. Hypothyroidism is associated with other neuropathies that could complicate the polyneuropathy of which laryngeal paralysis is a part. This means hypothyroidism should be identified and treated, but while improvement in weakness, etc., may be seen, the laryngeal paralysis will not reverse with thyroid hormone supplementation. Making the Diagnosis To determine if a dog has laryngeal paralysis, the larynx must be examined under sedation. The level of sedation must be heavy enough to allow the larynx to be inspected but light enough for the patient to take some deep breaths. If the sedation is too deep for the diagnosis to be obvious, a respiratory stimulant called Dopram® (doxapram hydrochloride) is given intravenously. This is to stimulate several deep breaths so that the function of the larynx is clear. In a normal larynx, the arytenoid cartilages are seen to open and close widely. In a paralyzed larynx, they just sit there limply while the patient breathes deeply. If the patient is having a respiratory crisis when seeing the veterinarian, this diagnostic test can easily be followed by intubation, inserting a breathing tube down the patient’s throat. This relieves the upper airway obstruction, and the patient can breathe normally. Unfortunately, sedation must be maintained to keep the tube in place. This potentially poses a problem when the patient must wake up, and the tube must be eventually removed. If waking up involves too much respiratory motion, the patient may have to be re-sedated and the tube put back in until another attempt at waking can be managed. A newer technique of visualizing the larynx involves threading an endoscope down the patient’s nostril. This is tricky, but the benefit is that sedation is not required. The downside is that specialized equipment is needed, and the patient may not be cooperative. Additional Testing There are some additional tests that are helpful in evaluating the patient with laryngeal paralysis. Chest radiographs are important in ruling out aspiration pneumonia (from inhaling food material through the non-functional larynx), megaesophagus (which we have mentioned tremendously complicates a laryngeal paralysis case), and obvious tumor spread. Radiographs of the throat to rule out obvious throat tumors are also helpful. Complete blood testing, including thyroid tests, should also be included in the workup. Conservative Treatment Treatment of laryngeal paralysis is most likely going to require surgery, but not everyone is ready or able to provide a surgical solution for their dog. Here are some tips for non-surgical management: The Crisis If laryngeal paralysis is not treated, a respiratory crisis can emerge. In this situation, the patient attempts to breathe deeply and simply cannot, creating a vicious cycle of anxiety and respiratory attempts. The laryngeal folds become swollen, making the throat obstruction still worse. The patient’s gums become bluish in color from lack of oxygen, and the patient begins to overheat. For reasons that remain unclear, fluid begins to flood the lungs, and the patient begins to drown (as if the laryngeal obstruction wasn’t lethal enough). The patient must be sedated, intubated, and cooled down with water in order to survive. As soon as intubation is in place, the patient can breathe normally, oxygen can be given, and the crisis can be curtailed if it has not progressed too far. Of course, eventually, the patient will have to wake up and be able to survive without medical equipment. Corticosteroids can be used to reduce the swelling, but ideally, one of several surgical solutions is needed. Surgical Solutions The goal of surgery, whichever technique is used, is to relieve the airway obstruction permanently while maintaining the original function of the larynx (protection of the airways). Laryngeal Tieback (also called Lateralization Surgery)This has probably become the most commonly performed surgery for laryngeal paralysis. It involves placing a couple of sutures in such a way as to pull one of the arytenoid cartilages backward. By repositioning one of the arytenoids, the opening of the larynx is made larger. The chief complication is that only a few millimeters of position change in the arytenoids are needed. If the cartilage is moved too much, the larynx cannot properly close, and aspiration pneumonia becomes a substantial risk. Commonly, these patients have a persistent cough after eating or drinking. This surgery has been associated with a 14 percent postoperative mortality rate. (Years ago, both arytenoids were tied back to create a still larger larynx, but tying off both cartilages in this way was associated with a 67% mortality rate, so it is no longer done.) Partial ArytenoidectomyAnother surgical technique involves only biting out one vocal fold and also biting out the arytenoid cartilage on the same side. There is more bleeding with this technique, and a tracheostomy becomes more desirable. Surgeries involving removing part of the larynx have been associated with a 30% mortality rate in laryngeal paralysis patients. Ventriculocordectomy (De-Barking)De-barking surgery is generally thought of as a surgical solution to a behavioral problem, but it is also a fair treatment for laryngeal paralysis. The usual method involves extending a long “biting” forceps down the throat and biting out the vocal folds. Obviously, anesthesia is needed to do this, and the fact that the surgical area is the larynx makes normal intubation for anesthesia impossible. This means either using injectable anesthesia or placing a tracheostomy (cutting a hole in the throat lower down) and intubating through that. Removing the vocal folds also removes the patient’s voice, reducing barking to a whisper. The hole created by the absence of the vocal folds makes for a larger airway opening and is generally large enough to relieve the obstruction. Complications of this surgery include swelling and bleeding (which can cause obstruction in themselves, though, if a tracheostomy is placed, any such obstruction is bypassed) and regrowth of a webbing of vocal tissue. An alternative technique involves approaching the larynx from the outside of the throat instead of down the mouth. This method is more difficult and time-consuming but less likely to develop webbing. A tracheostomy, if any, is allowed to heal closed. CastellationIn this surgery, a square of the thyroid cartilage is cut (similar to a castle’s turret's square behind which an archer might hide). This square is moved forward and reattached to create a wider laryngeal opening. A tracheostomy is frequently needed to protect from swelling. Post-Operative Considerations There are some special concerns after laryngeal surgery, regardless of the procedure: Aspiration Pneumonia While only about 10 percent of dogs being evaluated for surgical correction of laryngeal paralysis already haveaspiration pneumonia, nearly 25% will develop it at some point. Pneumonia is always potentially life-threatening, and aspiration pneumonia is particularly difficult to clear since it involves large contaminated food particles in the lung. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid therapy, and physical therapy are important tools, but sadly, the underlying condition that led to the original aspiration pneumonia is likely to produce future episodes.

Category: Resource Guarding in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is resource guarding and why does it occur? Resource guarding is a relatively common behavior problem in dogs. It is defined as a dog using avoidance, threatening, or aggressive behaviors to retain control of food or other items in front of a person or other animal. Sometimes, the signs of resource guarding are subtle. In these cases, your dog may show avoidance behavior or mild signs of aggression and anxiety such as stiff or crouched body posture, pinned back ears, lip licking, and physically blocking access to the resource. The aggression may escalate to more severe and overt signs of aggression such as growling, snapping, or biting. Food and food-related items are the most common resources that are guarded by dogs. However, any resource that is valuable to the dog may be guarded. This includes but is not limited to toys, beds, furniture, bones, resting areas, and even certain people. Resource guarding may have a genetic component and occurs in males or females of any breed. This issue can develop at any age. Resource guarding may be an issue that appears and progresses over time, or it may begin suddenly after a change in environment or routine. Resource guarding does not have anything to do with dominance. It is a common misconception that dogs show aggression or develop behavior problems because they do not understand their “place in the pack.” This misconception is problematic because it often leads to training using force and punishment to show the dog who is “top dog.” However,dominancein this sense has been scientifically debunked. Using force and punishment in a situation like resource guarding often makes the behavior problem worse and can cause your animal to fear you and damage your relationship. To successfully manage resource guarding, we must change the underlying motivation and emotion behind the behavior (anxiety, fear, frustration). Studies have shown that reward-based methods are more effective and humane when managing behavior problems such as resource guarding. To a degree, resource guarding can be considered a normal canine behavior since obtaining resources is necessary for survival. However, just because it can be considered normal does not make it desirable, safe, or acceptable in a household. Unfortunately, over time, dogs may learn that their aggressive responses are effective at protecting their resources, so the behavior will persist or even worsen. Additionally, if a dog’s mild signs of aggression are ignored or punished, this can cause their behaviors to escalate to more severe forms of aggression. For example, a dog may initially show mild signs such as freezing or hunching over their resource with a stiff body posture. If this behavior is punished or ignored the dog will likely realize subtle signs are not effective. In this situation, dogs are likely to escalate to more overt forms of aggression, such as growling, snapping, or biting. Then it becomes more challenging to manage and treat the issue. How can my veterinarian help with Resource Guarding? Your veterinarian may be able to help you with this problem themselves, or they may refer you to a veterinary behaviorist. If you are experiencing this problem with your pet, it is important that you discuss it with your veterinarian. Resource guarding may be caused by an underlying medical issue, especially if the behavior starts suddenly in an adult dog. Your veterinarian will complete a thorough physical exam and may request further testing based on their findings to determine if there is a medical issue. Sometimes medications can be helpful in the treatment of resource guarding especially if anxiety is a cause for the behavior.   Treatment and Management: What to do: Treatment and Management: What NOT to do: Prevention and Avoidance The treatment of resource guarding needs to be highly individualized for each dog and household. These dogs often need a combination of behavioral modification, training, and environmental and management changes.

Category: Respiratory Disease in Dogs Sweeping Across the US? Outbreak of Disease or Media Attention?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The following article has been adapted from theWorms & Germs Blog, by Dr. Scott Weese, DVM, DVSc, DACVIM. Many dog owners are currently asking, “What’s going on with this reported outbreak of respiratory disease in dogs in the US? What new disease is this?” I’m not sure there’s a new disease here. I’m not even sure if there’s a major outbreak (or any outbreak).Various groups are reporting stories of respiratory disease,which we refer to ascanine infectious respiratory disease complex, or CIRDC,in dogs in various parts of the US. CIRDC signs include: There’s always limited info about numbers due to a lack of funding, no real surveillance system, and testing that doesn’t necessarily change treatment for these dogs. Also, the disease description is usually vague…coughing dogs, some that get pneumonia, and unfortunately, a few that die. The issue is,thislargely describes our normal state. CIRDC is endemic(i.e.always present in dog populations), with various known bacterial and viral causes.  These includecanine parainfluenza virus,Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine respiratory coronavirus, canine pneumovirus, canine influenza virus,Streptococcus zooepidemicus...roughly in that order of occurrence, and maybe the mysteriousbacteria,Mycoplasma. There are also presumably a range of viruses that have been present for a long time but that we don’t diagnose. I get lots of emails every week asking whether there’s more or more severe CIRDC activity at the moment.The thing is, I’ve been getting those for years, from across North America. To me, that reflects the fact that there’s always circulation of CIRDC and that we notice it more at times, either because of local clusters or, increasingly, localraisesin awareness. We see CIRDC all the time, everywhere. There’s a background level of disease that usually flies under the radar, alongside periodic clusters. Media and social media can drive outbreak concerns. They can be great to get the word out and help sort out issues, but often, they lead to false alarms. For example, we might have 100 dogs with CIRDC every week in Guelph (a complete guess since we have no way to track this). Usually, few people hear about it. The dogs typically get better, and life goes on. However, if someone starts talking about it on social media, we might hear about 50 of those 100 cases. All of a sudden, we have an ‘outbreak of a disease affecting dozens of dogs’ when in reality, we might just have our normal background level of disease that people are actually noticing. The same thing happens more broadly. There are thousands of coughing dogs in the US every day since there are millions of dogs. Once people start talking about it, some of these comments go from, "Oh, my dog is coughing. I guess he picked up something at the park.”to comments like “OMG, my dog has this new disease that’s sweeping the nation." With the first approach, no one but the owner usually knows or is concerned.  When people are very worried about their beloved pets, panic, and post on social media, it can lead to further assumptions that things are much scarier or that a “new disease” is developing. So, what are these reports actually reflecting? I suspect it’s one of the last two. My perception is that we have been seeing a bit more CIRDC activity over the past couple of years and that we see a somewhat greater incidence of severe cases. Other factors to consider: Things are still unfolding for the veterinary community with CIRDC, but right now there does not appear to be a need for increased concern. What can you do to protect your dog? Overall, if you are concerned that your dog may have CIRDC or that they may be exposed due to certain activities, talk to your veterinarian. They can tell you what may increase their chances of contracting CIRDC and what to look out for based on your pet’s health status.

Category: Tracheal Collapse in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is the Trachea Anyway? Trachea is the scientific name for the windpipe, the tube that connects the nose, mouth, and throat to the lungs. The trachea is meant to be a fairly rigid tube. It consists of muscle connecting a group of cartilage rings. The rings are actually not complete circles; they form a C with the open end of the C facing towards the animal's back. The muscle covering the open end of the C is called the tracheal membrane or sometimes the trachealis muscle. When the diaphragm (the flat muscle separating the abdomen from the chest cavity) flattens and the intercostal muscles (the muscles between the ribs) move, air is sucked into the lung. When the muscles move in the opposite direction, air is pushed out of the lung. The trachea serves as a pipeline bringing air in and out of the chest.  The trachea spans the length of the throat and extends into the chest cavity so that we can look at the trachea as having an intrathoracic portion (inside the chest) and an extrathoracic portion (outside the chest). Why Would a Trachea Collapse? Tracheas collapse because the cartilage rings weaken, which is where the term tracheomalacia comes into play. Tracheomalacia is the condition where the cartilage becomes spongy and soft. Cartilage in this condition cannot hold its rigid C-shaped supportive structure.  When the C-shape loses its curvature, the tracheal membrane across the top stretches out and loosens, becoming floppy. Instead of being a tight muscle canopy, the now flimsy membrane moves as air passes through the trachea. When air rushes into the chest, the membrane of the intrathoracic trachea balloons outward, and when air rushes out the membrane of the intrathoracic trachea droops down into the C cartilage and causes an occlusion. The tickling sensation of the membrane touching the tracheal lining generates coughing, and if the obstruction interrupts breathing the patient may become distressed. If the collapse is in the extrathoracic (also called the cervical) trachea, the opposite occurs: the collapse occurs during inhalation and the ballooning during exhalation. In the unluckiest of patients, the tracheomalacia includes not only the trachea but down the bronchi (larger lung airways) as well. These patients have the worst prognosis and the worst coughing. Panting or rapid breathing for any reason makes the collapse and anxiety worse, which unfortunately tends to generate more rapid breathing and a vicious cycle of distress. Making things worse still is the inflammation generated in the trachea. The collapse creates increased secretion and inflammation, thus promoting yet more coughing, which creates yet more inflammation. The enzymes involved in inflammation further soften the tracheal cartilage, making the collapse worse. Ultimately, the tissue of the trachea changes and loses its normal characteristics and the condition gets worse and worse. The trachea may be collapsed along its entire length, only in the intrathoracic section, or only in the extrathoracic section. Most commonly the collapse is at its worst right where the trachea enters the chest. What Animals are Affected? The victim is almost always a toy breed dog, with poodles, Yorkshire terriers, and Pomeranians most commonly affected. The disease usually becomes problematic in middle age but can occur at any age. The cartilage defect that leads to the flattened C rings seems to be hereditary. Many dogs with collapsed tracheas do not show symptoms, however, until a second problem complicates matters. Factors that bring out symptoms might include: If a secondary factor such as one of those listed above should occur and make a previously incidental collapsed trachea problematic, oftentimes removal of the secondary factor (weight loss program, getting an air filter, etc.) may clear up the symptoms of the collapsed trachea. Treatment The following steps are often helpful in long-term management of the tracheal collapse patient: In a recent retrospective study of 100 dogs with collapsing trachea, 71 percent responded to medication and management of secondary factors (obesity, irritants in the air, etc.), 7% had disease so severe that they died within one month of diagnosis, 6 percent had severe additional disease problems, and the other 16 percent were felt to be candidates for surgical treatment. Emergency The patient's distress can reach a level so severe that the normally pink mucous membranes become bluish, and collapse can result. When this occurs, tranquilization is helpful to relieve the anxiety that perpetuates the heavy breathing and coughing. Oxygen therapy and cough suppressants also help. If the patient reaches the point where distress seems extreme or if collapse results, treat this as an emergency and rush the pet to emergency veterinary care. Surgery? If medical management does not produce satisfactory results, surgery may be beneficial. There are two procedures currently in use: placing steel tracheal rings to shore up the weakened cartilage and placing a cylindrical mesh prosthesis referred to as a tracheal stent. Either one might be used though in recent years there has been a trend toward the mesh stent and away from the ring prostheses. Both procedures have the potential for complications, and while improvement can be expected, patients will still require oral medications for coughing at least some of the time. Ring Prosthesis In this procedure a rigid prosthesis is placed and bonded around the trachea, effectively creating a non-collapsible tube. This procedure is largely effective as long as the collapsed portion is external to the chest. Should the intrathoracic trachea be involved, the surgery becomes far less successful. The ring prosthesis technique is reported to yield improvement in 75-85% of patients receiving it, but Buback's 1996 study also showed a 5% mortality rate and 10% of patients requiring a permanent tracheostomy (a surgically created hole in the trachea for breathing) within 24 hours of surgery. Furthermore, 11% developedlaryngeal paralysisas a result of the surgery and another 9% required a permanent tracheostomy later on. In that study, only 11% of patients had intrathoracic collapse so complications were by no means limited to those. Median survival was 25 months in that study. Mesh Stent The tracheal stent is a self-expanding, cylindrical stainless steel prosthesis. A study reporting the results of 24 dogs receiving this prosthesis was published in January 2004. Of these dogs, 96% showed improvement after surgery. Two dogs died within the first week due to stent placement complications. One dog experienced some bleeding. After the immediate post-surgical period, 30% were reported to be completely free of symptoms, 61% showed marked improvement, and 4% continued to have symptoms. Since this study, hundreds if not thousands of canine patients have received tracheal stents and improvement has been seen in 75-90% of patients. Complications generally stem from problems positioning the stent or with proliferative inflammatory tissues that can grow around the stent, causing further airway narrowing. Surgical solutions for tracheal collapse are not for mild cases; they are for cases that cannot be adequately controlled by medication, weight loss, and other non-surgical means. If you are interested in pursuing a surgical solution, speak to your veterinarian about what is involved for your particular pet. Surgery for a tracheal collapse may be a procedure that your veterinarian is not comfortable performing. Discuss with your veterinarian whether a referral to a specialist may be in your pet's best interest. Is Liver Disease Associated? In the July/August 2006 issue of theJournal of Veterinary Internal Medicine, a group of researchers led by Natali B. Bauer pursued the common finding of enlarged liver in dogs with tracheal collapse. Her group looked at 26 dogs with tracheal collapse and compared liver function test results to 42 dogs without tracheal collapse. Ninety-two percent (92 percent) of dogs with tracheal collapse were found to have abnormal results. Dogs that received stent placement to assist their breathing showed improvement in these tests. It was concluded that oxygen deprivation from the collapse had resulted in significant liver disease in many tracheal collapse patients. It was further recommended that tracheal collapse patients have liver function tests periodically performed as liver supportive medications may be helpful.

Category: Using Dogs to Sniff Out Respiratory Disease in Calves
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bovine respiratory disease is the leading cause of death in calves, and Texas A&M University is researching how dogs can be used to sniff out which calves are infected. Dogs have been trained to sniff out human diseases, and Dr. Courtney Daigle, DVM, Assistant Professor, West Texas A&M University, is working with respiratory specialist Dr. John Richeson, B.S., M.S., Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Animal Science, and dog training expert Dr. Nathan Hall at Texas Tech University, to see if dogs can be trained to do the same with cattle. The first study looked at the equipment and training needed. The second study used cattle from the Texas AgriLife Research Center and guard dogs from the prison system in Huntsville, TX. Dr. Daigle says this technology could change how antimicrobial treatment is applied in commercial beef production. Currently, cattle health is evaluated at the group level, and if thought necessary, the entire group is treated with antibiotics. By using trained dogs to find individual animals that are infected, fewer antibiotics would be needed. A well-trained dog and handler near the cattle chute could allow the producer to target only infected animals with antibiotics, significantly reducing the amount of antibiotics and saving the producer money. In the pilot study, two dogs were trained in a series of stages over seven months to be able to know the difference between nasal swabs collected upon arrival at the feedlot from cattle that developed a respiratory infection within 20 days and cattle that did not develop a respiratory infection in the next three months. The first study did not show a positive response, and it was concluded that bovine respiratory disease may be more difficult to diagnose than other diseases. The second study, now underway, will decide if the dogs can tell sick cattle from healthy cattle.

Category: Bladder Stones (Oxalate) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are many types of bladder stones, and each tends to form in a specific breed or species under specific conditions. Oxalate Bladder Stones in Dogs How Are Stone Types Determined? Although a urinalysis can provide a clue, the only way to know for sure that a dog’s bladder stone is an oxalate is to retrieve a stone and have a laboratory analyze it. If the stones are very small, flushing the urinary bladder and expressing it (known as voiding urohydropropulsion) may not only produce a stone sample for testing but remove all the stones and alleviate the current signs. When stones are too large to fit out the urethra, they can be removed to resolve signs and obtain sample stones by surgical removal from the bladder (the traditional method), retrieving them by sending a cystoscope up the urethra, or by using laparoscopy (percutaneous cystolithotomy – PCCL) to send a cystoscope through a small incision into the abdomen and then into the bladder and using a grabbing device in the cystoscope channel to retrieve them. Calcium oxalate stones cannot be made to dissolve over time by changing to a special diet (as can be done with struvite or uric acid bladder stones). Why Would My Dog Form Calcium Oxalate Stones? It shouldn't be too surprising that there is a strong hereditary component to forming oxalate bladder stones; this is also true in humans. There is a substance (called nephrocalcin) in urine that naturally inhibits the formation of calcium oxalate stones. This substance can be defective in both humans and dogs who form calcium oxalate bladder stones. This has been demonstrated in Miniature Schnauzers. Other breeds, such as English Bulldogs and related breeds have Hereditary Calcium Oxalate Urolithiasis Type 1, which is noteworthy for earlier age at the initial development of stones. There is also a Type 2 disorder from a different mutation. There are other potential genetic causes as well. There is a bacteria that exists as part of the normal flora of the GI tract that metabolizes oxalate. Antimicrobial use may eliminate this good bacterium altogether. This would be expected to increase calcium oxalate stone risk and is being studied. In humans, the genetic predisposition for stone formation is coupled with dietary issues (problem foods include spinach, peanuts, chocolate, dairy products, calcium supplements, vitamin C supplements, and tea). Dogs are more likely to eat simply a commercial brand of dog food without nearly the dietary variety that humans experience. This means that diet can often be used to manage the problem in the dog unless genetics (not diet) is the cause. There are some metabolic diseases that might predispose a dog to create a calcium oxalate stone. For example, a dog with Cushing's disease will be overproducing cortisol (commonly known as cortisone). This hormone increases calcium excretion in urine. The extra calcium present in the urine will promote a stone. Some animals may have an elevated blood calcium level (hypercalcemia) for any number of reasons, and this could lead to excess calcium in the urine as the body attempts to restore calcium balance. Again, extra calcium in the urine promotes a stone. Screening for such medical conditions is important and is generally part of the medical workup once stones are detected on a radiograph. If any such metabolic problems are uncovered, they will need to be treated separately. As these problems are resolved, no further stone prevention measures should be needed. Because of the complexity involving a variety of different causes and risk factors, this should be viewed as a group of diseases that result in the same endpoint, calcium oxalate stones. The specific cause does change what prevention measures are expected to help. Clues based on the breed can help; but it can be very difficult to know which disease and risk factors are present in any given dog, contributing to the high recurrence rate of these stones in dogs. Why Can’t The Stones Stay Where They Are? The most immediate concern for the dog with bladder stones is that the urinary opening may obstruct as the dog attempts to pass the stones. This is largely a male dog problem but the results can be life-threatening uremic poisoning. In such cases, the veterinarian will try to dislodge the stone, flushing it back into the bladder to restore the patency of the urinary opening. If the stone cannot be dislodged, a new urinary opening may have to be surgically created. The urethra (the narrow tube connecting the urinary bladder to the outside world) is a difficult place to perform surgery, so it is preferable to move the stone back into the bladder for removal rather than attempting removal from the urethra. Bladder stones are irritating to the bladder simply by rubbing on the tender bladder lining. Bleeding typically results, and, of course, the chance of developing chronic bladder infections is markedly increased with the presence of bladder stones. Because calcium oxalate stones cannot be dissolved by diet change, removing the stones is usually necessary.Studies have shown that 50% of dogs who have undergone such surgery will develop new calcium oxalate stoneswithin three years unless proper prevention is instituted. The following therapeutic plan has been devised to minimize the chance of recurrence after the stones have been removed. Step One: Diet While special diets cannot dissolve existing stones, they do help prevent new stones from developing. Prevention centers on creating a urinary environment with minimal calcium and oxalate as well as creating a urine pH that is not conducive to calcium oxalate formation. Further, high protein, high sodium diets should not be used and diets low in phosphorus may stimulate vitamin D production and could increase calcium absorption. Commercial specialty foods with these requirements are available. Work with your veterinarian to find an appropriate diet. For each of the commercially available diets, the canned form is preferable to dry to increase water consumption and thus help dilute the urine. It is especially important to avoid table scraps when caring for an oxalate stone-forming dog. Still, no one wants their dog to live life without treats. The following treats are acceptable for oxalate stone-forming dogs: Selecting a diet that actually prevents stones but is also desirable to the picky pet may be challenging. It may be possible to have a veterinary nutritionist provide a recipe for an appropriate home-cooked diet. Please visit www.balanceit.com or www.petdiets.com for details. Some medications can increase the risk of calcium oxalate stone development, and these should be avoided. Prednisone and other cortisone-type medications (commonly used for itchy skin, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other inflammatory conditions) should be avoided if possible.Furosemide(brand name: Lasix or Salix) is a diuretic mostly used in the treatment of heart failure. Both these medications lead to excess calcium in the urine. Should a diuretic be needed for a patient at risk for calcium oxalate stones, one from the thiazide class (see later) would be a better choice. Supplementation with Vitamins D or C also increases the risk of forming oxalate stones; such supplementation should be discontinued. Step Two: Urinalysis and RadiographsTwo to four weeks after surgery, a urine sample is checked and the bladder is radiographed. If the urine is not adequately diluted (meaning the specific gravity is less than 1.020), water consumption will have to be increased (either by adding water to the food or increasing the amount of canned food). If urinary pH is less than 6.5 or if oxalate crystals are seen, it is time to go to Step Three. If all is well, a urinalysis should be performed every three to six months or so for the rest of the dog’s life (the University of Minnesota’s current recommendation). Radiographs are also taken every 6-12 months so that any new stones will still be small enough to be retrieved from the bladder by flushing. If you skip this monitoring, you may find stones have developed to a large size, and surgery is again needed to remove them. Step Three: Potassium CitrateBy taking potassium citrate pills, citrate levels increase in the urine. Calcium binds to the citrate instead of the oxalate. This is a desirable event since calcium citrate tends to stay dissolved, whereas calcium oxalate tends to precipitate out as a mineral deposit. Potassium citrate also helps create alkaline urine (in which calcium oxalate stones have difficulty forming). Potassium citrate supplements are typically given twice a day. Step Four: Urinalysis AgainTwo to four weeks after potassium citrate is added to the therapeutic diet, a urine sample is checked. If the urine is not adequately diluted, water consumption will have to be increased either by adding water to the food or increasing the amount of canned food. If urinary pH is less than 6.5 or if oxalate crystals are seen, it is time to go to Step Five. If all is well, urinalysis and radiographs should be performed every 6-12 months or so for the rest of the dog’s life (the University of Minnesota’s current recommendation). In other words, if the urinalysis shows all the desired parameters and radiographs show no new stones forming, then therapy is working, and the pet can go on a regular monitoring schedule. If testing shows the patient is still predisposed to stone formation, it is necessary to proceed down this list until control is achieved. Again, radiographs should be taken every six to 12 months. Step Five: Thiazide DiureticsA diuretic is a medication designed to increase the amount of urine produced. The thiazide class of diuretics does this in a way that reduces the calcium content of the urine. This medication is typically given twice a day and electrolytes are generally measured via blood test within the first two weeks of this treatment. There will always be some dogs who continue to form stones no matter what is done. With radiographic monitoring, it is hoped that new stones can be detected while they are still small. As research continues, new developments may arise that will not require such frequent monitoring. A Note On The Bichon Frise The Bichon Frise appears to have a unique situation with oxalate bladder stones in that they seem to begin to recur virtually as soon as they have been removed. In a study presented by Jody Lulich's group at the University of Minnesota at the 2004 meeting of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine, 24 out of 33 Bichons had oxalate stone recurrence after cystotomy (37% had had their first recurrence in the first year after surgery, by the end of the second year 57% had recurred, and by the end of the third year 73% had recurred, some more than once). Steps to prevent recurrence need to be particularly aggressive from the beginning in this breed as they seem to have 20 times the risk of oxalate stone formation compared to other breeds. Preventing Male Dog Obstruction In male dogs, a bone called the os penis is located in the penis, surrounding the urethra. Urine passes through this hollow bone like water through a pipe. Because this area is made of bone, it cannot stretch or expand to accommodate a stone trying to pass. A stone blockage of this type leads to an emergency and death if it goes untreated. In a perfect world, controlling the bladder stones controls the risk of obstructions, but controlling the bladder stones is not always easy, and treating a dog over and over for obstruction becomes expensive. A surgical procedure called a urethrostomy can be performed to prevent obstruction. This procedure involves creating a new urinary opening in the area of the scrotum. This allows urine to be expelled earlier in its course so that passage through the os penis does not occur. The flexibility of the non-bony part of the urethra plus the surgically enlarged urinary opening allows for smaller stones to pass rather than stick in the os penis. To perform this surgery, the male dog must be neutered (which can be done at the time of the urethrostomy). The creation of the new opening usually requires the removal of the empty scrotum. While this is not as good an outcome as preventing stone recurrence, at least the emergency obstruction is prevented. Calcium oxalate bladder stones can be frustrating. Not only do they tend to recur, but following monitoring recommendations involves a visit to the veterinarian's office every three to six months. It is up to every owner how rigid to be with guidelines, but keep in mind that the trouble and expense of a stone surgery weigh against the much less trouble and expense of monitoring. Laser Lithotripsy A new technique of stone removal involves the use of a laser to blast the stone into pieces small enough to pass. This option (calledlaser lithotripsy) is especially useful when the number of stones present is small and/or when a stone is lodged in the urethra and cannot be flushed into the bladder. It will not be helpful for a large number of stones as the process would be too time-consuming relative to a more conventional approach but for the right patient, it is less invasive than other procedures.

Category: Bladder Stones (Struvite) in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are many types of bladder stones, and each type forms under specific circumstances. In almost all cases, struvite bladder stones in dogs are caused by bladder infection with specially enabled bacteria.Staphylococci(often simply calledStaph) andProteusbacteria are the usual culprits, and they gain access to the bladder by simply crawling up from the lower urinary tract. Some patients with bladder stones show no symptoms of any kind and the stones are discovered incidentally but there are some symptoms that might promote a search for stones. Bloody urine, recurrent bladder infection (especially by the same organism and especially ifStaphylococciorProteusis cultured), or straining to urinate all would raise suspicion. Fortunately, struvite stones are radio-opaque, which means they show up readily on radiographs. Occasionally stones are simply passed and discovered by the pet owner. If this occurs, it is important to bring the stone to your vet's office for analysis, have the dog examined, and have radiographs taken to check for more stones.  Patient care will be highly dependent on the stone's mineral composition. When to Suspect Struvite Stones Bladder stones come in several mineral compositions. The most common stone types areoxalateand struvite. Since the approach is different for each type, it is crucial to determine the stone type. The stone type can be confirmed if a sample stone is available (either passed naturally or obtained via surgery, voiding urohydropropulsion, or cystoscopy). A laboratory analysis can easily determine the content of the stone and even determine if the stone consists of layers of different mineral types. Without a sample stone, there are still some hints that can be obtained through other tests. As mentioned, struvite stones in dogs are almost always formed because of the urinary changes that occur with specific types of bladder infection: almost alwaysStaphylococcalinfection but occasionally aProteusinfection. If a urine culture from a patient with a bladder stone should grow either staph orproteus, this would make struvite more likely than oxalate. Also, struvite requires an alkaline pH to form while oxalate requires an acid pH to form; urine pH is a part of any urinalysis and thus provides another clue as to the stone's identity. An educated guess is better than nothing but does not replace the analysis of a stone. Remember, occasionally a stone of one type forms around a stone of another type. A complete analysis is needed to effectively prevent a recurrence. How Do Struvite Stones Form? Struvite is the name given to the crystal composed of magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate. (Struvite is also occasionally referred to as “triple phosphate” due to an old erroneous belief that the phosphate ion was bonded to three positive ions instead of just magnesium and ammonium.) Struvite crystals are not unusual in normal urine, and their presence alone does not require treatment. Combine them with certain bacteria, however, and a stone is created. Stone creation is made possible by an enzyme called urease that certain bacteria, particularlyStaphylococciandProteusspecies, can produce. Urea is a substance seen in large amounts in urine. Where does all this urea come from? In short, when the body breaks down amino acids, it must contend with the ammonium that is generated in this process. The ammonium, which would be toxic if left alone, is converted to urea, which is much less toxic and is readily soluble in water, making for its easy disposal in urine. Unfortunately, adding urease-positive bacteria into the urinary bladder converts the urea back into ammonium. The combination of infection and inflammation caused by the ammonium creates a matrix that traps the struvite crystals and gels into an actual stone. This reaction can only take place in alkaline urine but the ammonium creates the perfect pH for stone formation. In dogs, the general rule is, if there is no infection, there are no struvite bladder stones. There are a few rare exceptions to this rule. Certain antacids and diuretics can produce struvite stones when there isn't any infection. A hormone imbalance called hyperaldosteronism is associated with struvite stone development. The hereditary situation of the English cocker spaniel also represents an exception, as in at least one genetic line of this breed has the tendency to form a purely metabolic struvite stone has been documented. These situations are rare, and for most patients, the focus of struvite stone management is dealing with bladder infections and preventing future ones. What Should Be Done About Struvite Bladder Stones? Struvite stones can be removed surgically with a technique called voiding urohydropropulsion; removed with a cystoscope (if they are small enough); or dissolved by diet (also called dissolution). Stone dissolution with diet is the least invasive and probably the best option unless the patient really needs a faster treatment, such as if there is a risk of urinary obstruction in a male dog. Each approach has pros and cons. Dietary therapy to prevent new struvite stones is of secondary importance in dogs (except the English Cocker spaniel, for which this is a hereditary metabolic problem rather than a matter of infection).The focus is on preventing infection. If your dog has a history of struvite bladder stones, be sure to discuss long-term monitoring and understand what schedule of testing is best for your pet. Expect periodic urine cultures to be needed. Dietary DissolutionDietary dissolution of the stone is not only possible with struvite bladder stones, it is actually the treatment of choice. There are several therapeutic diets available by prescription from your veterinarian that are designed to dissolve struvite bladder stones when they are in the bladder by creating urine that is not compatible with the solid state of struvite. A therapeutic diet must be the only food fed until the stone is dissolved. Antibiotics are needed as long as stones are in the bladder (bacteria are encrusted within the stone and as the stone dissolves, they are released). Every 4 to 6 weeks, new radiographs are taken to evaluate the stone size. If it is at least 20 percent smaller, the process is continued. A urinalysis is also checked to be sure the proper urinary conditions for dissolution are being created by the diet. On average, 2 to 3 months are needed to dissolve stones, but the diet should be continued for a full month after the stones are no longer visible on radiographs because small stones may not be large enough to see. Small stones are typically dissolved in just a few weeks as long as the infection is controlled. After the stones are dissolved, periodic (usually quarterly) urine cultures are performed to check for infection recurrence. If stones do not shrink as expected on the dissolution diet, they may not be pure struvite stones, and another method described below should be selected. The main advantage of the dissolution method is that it seems to be the lowest risk and most comfortable approach for the dog. That said, an important disadvantage of the dissolution approach is the possibility of urinary tract obstruction as the stone gets smaller and gets lodged in the urethra on the way out. This is potentially a life-threatening hazard for male dogs as they have a narrow urethra. The stone cannot be dissolved in the urethra as, for dissolution to work, the stone must be immersed in urine, which is not the case in the urethra. Furthermore, the inability to pass urine is an emergency, and the patient will die of uremic poisoning in a matter of days if urine flow cannot be restored. The stone can be pushed back into the bladder and dissolution re-attempted but at this point, it may be best to go for a faster resolution with surgery, lithotripsy, cystoscopy, orvoidingurohydropropulsion. Many dissolution diets are really high in fat and high in salt. They may not be appropriate for patients with a past or current history ofpancreatitis, patients with heart disease,kidney insufficiency, orhigh blood pressure. SurgerySurgical removal is the most direct method. The advantage is that the stones are removed and healing may commence all in one day. The chief disadvantages are those inherent to surgery: anesthetic risks, post-operative pain, risk of contaminating the abdomen with infected urine, the possibility that not all stones will be removed, and the possibility that the bladder stitches will not properly hold. These risks are generally considered minor and complications associated with cystotomy (opening of the urinary bladder) are unusual. The patient usually stays in the hospital for a day or two to be sure urine production is normal, to properly confine the patient, and to assess pain. If the dog has urethral stones, they can usually be flushed back into the urinary bladder for surgical removal. If the stone is lodged too tightly for this, it can be removed surgically from the urethra, although the potential for urethral scarring usually makes this a last-choice approach. Voiding UrohydropropulsionIf the stones are small enough to pass, the bladder can be manipulated in a way to promote expelling them through the urethra. This is called voiding urohydropropulsion and involves filling the bladder, agitating it so the stones float freely in the urine, and then generating a high-pressure urine stream to force the stones out. The patient must typically be held vertically so that gravity may assist in the expulsion of the stones. This technique only works if the stones are small and the patient is not too large. Sedation or general anesthesia is needed. If there are numerous stones, several attempts are often needed if this is to be the only means of removal. Often, this technique is used to obtain a sample stone for analysis to determine if dietary dissolution is feasible. Cystoscopic Retrieval/Laser LithotripsyIf you wish to avoid surgery and the stones are small enough, a cystoscope can be passed into the patient's bladder, and the stones retrieved with a basket (or fragmented via laserlithotripsy). This requires specific equipment most clinics do not have, and thus, usually needs referral to a specialty practice. It is generally more expensive than surgery, though recovery time for the patient is typically much faster. Recurrence After stones are removed one way or another, the focus shifts to prevention. Often, patients are somehow predisposed to a bladder infection, which means they are also predisposed to form more struvite bladder stones. A stone can form as quickly as two weeks after infection if a urease-positive bacterium sets in. After surgery, antibiotics must be continued until the infection is confirmed to have cleared (i.e., a negative urine culture is obtained). After this, a follow-up schedule of radiographs and/or urine testing is recommended. For a single stone episode, only a few follow-up visits may be necessary. Realize that some individual animals are predisposed to recurring bladder infections, and they may form new struvite stones repeatedly. Obviously, if stones were to recur, a more regular monitoring schedule would have to be revised. Dietary therapy in the prevention of struvite stones is of secondary importance in dogs (with the exceptions being the rare situations mentioned above). The focus is on preventing infection. If your dog has had a history of struvite bladder stones, be sure to discuss long-term monitoring and understand what testing schedule is best for your pet.

Category: Ectopic Ureters in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you are reading this information, the chances are that you have a puppy (probably female) with urinary incontinence and you have been told that she may have ectopic ureters. Most likely, your puppy has not responded completely to treatment for bladder infection nor to the usual urinary incontinence treatments, and seems to have more than just a house-breaking problem. If she really does have an ectopic ureter or even two, the only chance at resolving the incontinence is through surgery. This is expensive and often unsuccessful, so it is important for you to know what you're getting into. What are Ectopic Ureters? Before it is possible to understand ectopic ureters, one must understand the normal anatomy of the urinary tract. The two kidneys sit in the lower back where they are at work every moment of our lives from cradle to grave. The kidneys are a very advanced waste filtration system where the end product is urine: a water-based solution into which the body’s waste chemicals are dissolved. Urine is made continuously and transported to the urinary bladder for storage. The tiny pipelines through which the urine is transported from the kidney to the bladder are the ureters (one for the left kidney and one for the right). The bladder stores the urine until it can be voluntarily unloaded. The chute that connects the bladder with the outside world is the urethra. This is a good system, and it works well most of the time. We constantly filter unwanted wastes, yet we do not dribble urine constantly. We store our urine until we want to use it for territorial marking or perhaps until it is simply sanitary and convenient to get rid of it. Ectopic ureters are an embryological error when this tract is developing. Instead of connecting to the bladder, the ureters connect to the urethra, the vagina, the colon, or even the uterus. The ureters are thus bringing urine to an area unequipped for urine storage so leaking results. Incontinence and infection are the usual outcomes. Most affected animals are female, and often there are multiple internal urinary anatomical abnormalities. Signs of Ectopic Ureters The patient is usually a female puppy under the age of one year with the following: It should be noted that an uncomplicated bladder infection would cause all of the above as well and would be a far more common explanation. Ectopic ureters are rare, and it is important to look for more common explanations for the above. Many puppies demonstrate submissive urination or have house-breaking problems and these should be ruled out as well. A urinalysis and culture will determine if the dog has a bladder infection and if so, which antibiotics will work against it. A basic blood panel will assess kidney function. If the incontinence and/or infection continues despite appropriate treatment, further diagnostic steps will be needed. Radiographs – Plain and Contrast A plain radiograph (X-ray) would be the next step after urine evaluation. A radiograph is like a photograph only instead of using light to expose a piece of film, X-rays are used to expose the film. Visible abnormalities with the shape or size of the kidneys can be seen as can certain types of bladder stones. The problem is that even when enlarged by disease, the ureters themselves are still too small to be seen on a radiograph; special contrast is needed. Contrast media are special dyes, often iodine-based. On a radiograph, they appear white and are used to highlight small structures or separate overlapping structures. The Intravenous Pyelogram (I.V.P.)The I.V.P. is a contrast radiographic study used to identify the ectopic ureters. After fasting, the patient is given an enema to ensure that the GI tract is cleared of any contents that might obscure the view of the tiny ureters. Contrast dye is given intravenously, and radiographs are taken that show the dye moving through the kidneys, the ureters, and into the bladder. The normal ureter can be seen on its course to the bladder in this way. This test is associated with 60-70 percent accuracy. UltrasoundUltrasound uses the echoes of sound waves to create an image. With an experienced imager, the accuracy of ultrasound in the diagnosis of ectopic ureters is similar to that of the I.V.P. The normal ureter is too small to be seen with ultrasound but the tiny squirt of urine from the ureter into the bladder is generally visible. If the ureter is distended (often the case with ectopic ureters), this could be seen using ultrasound. Ultrasound is less invasive to the patient than the I.V.P. but not as accurate. Ultrasound is mostly used to evaluate the urinary tract for other conditions that should not be missed in the course of the workup. To answer the question about whether there are ectopic ureters, ultrasound is not the best bet for that. Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CAT or CT Scan)In humans, CT scanning is the diagnostic method of choice for the diagnosis of ectopic ureters. It is highly accurate and reveals the exact location of the ureter attachment. This form of imaging will be more accurate than ultrasound or I.V.P. but is not available as widely, requires general anesthesia, and is likely more costly than the aforementioned procedures. CystoscopyCystoscopy is generally used to clear up cases where one simply is not sure if there is an ectopic ureter or not after the above testing. Cystoscopy employs a tiny camera on the end of a probe which can be used inside the urethra, vagina, or bladder to locate the ureteral openings. Patients should weigh at least seven pounds for this procedure and, since most hospitals are not equipped for cystoscopy, a referral is likely needed.  Another disadvantage of cystoscopy is that it does not evaluate the upper urinary tract. Since the state of the kidneys is an important piece of information, an ultrasound would be a nice complementary test to get the full story of what is going on in the patient's urinary tract higher up. An advantage of cystoscopy is that laser surgery can often be performed on the same anesthesia thus confirming and correcting the problem all in one procedure. Treatment of the Ectopic Ureter The moment of truth comes with surgical exploration (or cystoscopy) with the intent to correct the incontinence. With surgery, the patient’s urinary bladder will be opened and the ureteral openings located. With cystoscopy, the cystoscope camera goes into the bladder and locates the ureteral openings. Some ectopic ureters go to the bladder as they are supposed to but instead of entering the bladder, simply course along the outside of the bladder to end elsewhere. During surgery, both ureters are identified and followed to their terminal points. One of the following surgical techniques will be used depending on where the ureters are going. Neoureterostomy (read “neo-ureter-ostomy”)This word literally means “new-ureter-opening,” which is somewhat self-explanatory. This procedure is used for ureters that attach to the bladder but do not actually enter the bladder (as described above). Here, an opening into the bladder is made where the ureter attaches but has failed to penetrate. The part of the ureter beyond this opening is removed. This sounds simple enough but removing that extra piece of ureter actually involves a great deal of manipulation through the very important bladder sphincter. Sphincter scarring or other damage can result from the manipulation. Often incontinence is a continuing problem even after surgery and further treatment is needed. A more successful approach is to use cystoscopy and a laser to cut back the ureter to a more appropriate opening. Better continence is generally achieved in this way though facilities with appropriate equipment may not be generally available. See below for information on LASER Ablation. Neoureterocystostomy (read “Neo-uretero-cystostomy”)This word means “new-ureter and bladder opening.” This technique is used for ureters that bypass the urinary bladder totally and connect elsewhere. The offending ureter is located, tied off, and gently teased away from its inappropriate connection so as to preserve its blood supply. A new opening in the urinary bladder is made, and the ureter is pulled through, snipped short, and sewn in place, being sure not to twist it. There is usually swelling at the site of the new attachment, which interrupts the urine flow into the bladder and can distend the ureter. Urine may back up into the kidney and cause damage to the kidney. The swelling generally has resolved after six weeks but if both ureters undergo the same procedure at the same time, then both kidneys may suffer enough damage to lead to kidney failure. Nephroureterectomy (read “nephro-ureter-etomy”)Nephroureterectomy means removal of the kidney and ureter, a self-explanatory definition. If the kidney is so infected or diseased as to be useless, it is just as well to remove the ureter and the entire kidney. This procedure would not be undertaken unless the other kidney was normal or near normal. Complications Several days of hospitalization are required after any of these surgeries; the patient will not be going home the next day. Expect antibiotics and pain relief medications for home use. If cystoscopy and laser ablation are used, however, these patients often do go home the same day as their procedure. Most patients will have urinary straining and some discomfort after surgery. A urinary catheter is generally in place for a day or two after surgery to prevent bladder distension during the first days of healing. Incontinence is likely to continue after surgery but in 55 percent of dogs, it was improved. Several studies have been done to determine the incidence of total incontinence resolution and depending on the study 33-58 percent actually were free of their incontinence. With anatomy corrected, however, medication for urinary incontinence is likely to be much more successful than it would have been prior to surgery. If incontinence is still intractable two to three months after surgery, a new I.V.P. should assess the surgical result. Surgical procedures to specifically addressurinary incontinencecan be performed. Alternatives to Surgery LASER AblationBecause of the special equipment needed, LASER ablation is only available in limited locations. LASER ablation is best used for intramural ectopic ureters. These are ureters that start to enter the bladder where they are supposed to but do not actually penetrate all the way in. Instead they continue inside the bladder wall and open up in the urethra or vagina. It is the tunneling effect that makes this particular type of ectopic ureter difficult to address with conventional surgery as described above. A less invasive approach with less post-treatment incontinence involves using a cystoscope and a LASER. The cystoscope is a long instrument with a camera on the end that can be guided up the urethra to where the opening of the ectopic ureter can be seen. A LASER can be used to cut the ectopic ureter back to the level of the bladder. Most patients are able to leave the hospital within 24 hours and are completely continent. Males typically remain continent but some 40 percent of females ultimately require additional treatment to remain continent. This represents an improvement over results obtained with neoureterostomy.

Category: Kidney Dialysis: Is It for Your Pet?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources The kidney is a tremendous organizer of our small ions. It determines how much calcium to keep and how much to dump. It controls our blood's pH by controlling which acids and bases to keep and which to lose. It controls sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, water balance, and more.  The kidney filters unwanted toxic biochemicals and gets rid of them using a process called excretion. Not only are toxins removed, but they are removed using just the right amount of water so that hydration is maintained. In failure, however, everything goes haywire. The wrong things are dumped, the wrong things are kept, toxins build up and the patient is sick. The state of toxicity that results is called uremia or uremic poisoning. Almost every animal hospital can provide diuresis, therapy in which extra fluid beyond what the patient can drink is provided, thus giving the kidney a boost to remove toxic waste. This works well in a large number of patients but there comes a time when, even with plenty of fluids, the sick kidney simply cannot get the toxins out. For most patients, this is the end of the line. In fact, however, dialysis may be another choice. It must be understood that dialysis is substantially more expensive than diuresis, and centers that provide dialysis for pets are still few and far between. What Is Dialysis? Dialysis is a process that can be thought of as cleansing the blood of toxins. This is done using a membrane called a dialyzer membrane and a fluid called dialysate. The blood is separated from the dialysate by the dialyzer membrane. The dialysate fluid is formulated so that the toxins in the blood will be attracted across the dialyzer membrane and into the dialysate fluid. There are two types of dialysis: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. When most people refer to someone needing dialysis, they mean hemodialysis. The patient is hooked up to the dialysis machine by an intravenous catheter and a pump forces the patient's blood into the machine for cleansing. The detoxified blood is returned to the patient. Peritoneal dialysis is less high-tech and uses the patient's own abdomen as the dialyzer membrane. The belly is filled with dialysate fluid, toxins are attracted into the fluid over several hours and the fluid (with its toxins) is drained from the belly at the end of the procedure. Hemodialysis (Description and FAQ) The intravenous catheters used in hemodialysis are very large and very long so as to support the appropriate speed of blood flow through the dialyzer. The catheters are difficult to place so surgery may be necessary to do so. A long-term IV port under the skin may be needed if treatments are to be ongoing. A single catheter may be in place for months. The treatment lasts three to five hours, sometimes longer, during which the patient must calmly sit on a table attached to the equipment. Treatments typically are performed three times a week either indefinitely (as in chronic renal failure) or until the kidney has healed (as in acute renal failure). There are numerous conditions that will benefit from this type of blood cleansing besides kidney failure. Electrolyte imbalances, heart failure, and many poisonings can also be treated with hemodialysis. WhyIsThisSoLonginComingtoPets? Part of the problem has been that dialysis machines are generally designed for human patients. The amount of blood that goes through the human dialysis machine is too large a blood loss for a veterinary patient to withstand so smaller machines had to be built. A veterinary dialysis machine had to be designed for patients as small as a 5 or 6-pound cat. Furthermore, a dialysis center requires specifically trained staff and 24-hour staffing. It was and is difficult to get such facilities financed. The procedure is still expensive and requires a dedicated owner but at least it is now an option. How Often Is Dialysis Performed on a Patient? The patient who depends on dialysis to relieve the symptoms of uremia must have dialysis three times a week on average. The pet owner must be able to bring the pet to the dialysis center with this frequency and leave the pet for the several hours needed.Kidney transplantpatients, of course, only require dialysis until they are well enough for surgery. Patients with a stone obstructing a ureter (the tube connecting the kidney and bladder) will require dialysis until they are stable for surgery. Patients who have lost kidney function acutely from poisoning, usually antifreeze, or infection (usually leptospirosis) typically require a month of therapy while their kidneys heal. Other patients may require therapy indefinitely. Does Dialysis Reliably Control Uremic Poisoning? Not all patients respond to dialysis. How a given patient will do in part depends on what caused the kidney failure in the first place (toxin vs. infection vs. metabolic causes). Out of 138 dogs who failed to respond to conventional therapy for kidney failure — diuresis — at the University of California, 40% responded to dialysis. Infectious causes (generallyleptospirosis) tend to have a better prognosis. As leptospirosis has re-emerged as a common cause of canine acute kidney failure, the overall response rate for dogs receiving dialysis has improved to 50%. In a study in 2003 of cats requiring hemodialysis, the response rate was 56%; the best prognosis was for those with a ureter obstruction where over 70% survived. At What Point in Treatment Is Dialysis Recommended? If dialysis is being considered, it is best not to wait until conventional therapy has completely failed and the pet is on death's door. Let your veterinarian know from the start that this is an option you are interested in so that your veterinarian can consult with the dialysis center on the best time to refer. What Are the Complications and Disadvantages? A new world of complications (beyond those of conventionally managed kidney patients) is introduced to the kidney patient on dialysis. Malnutrition and NauseaThe toxin build-up in kidney failure causes nausea, and appetite loss follows. Toxins further cause ulcers in the stomach and intestine that contribute even more to the loss of appetite. Once the toxins are removed, the intestine heals quickly but appetite loss may persist. Making the nutrition issue worse is the fact that dialysis patients have an increased protein requirement and an increased calorie requirement. It is particularly important for the dialysis patient to get nutrients in one way or another. Feeding tubes or IV feeding may be necessary. Metabolic Bone DiseaseWhen the sick kidney does not properly get rid of phosphorus, calcium is mobilized in a complicated hormonal reaction. Dialysis patients appear to be at higher risk for broken bones than are conventionally-managed kidney patients. Carnitine DeficiencyCarnitine is a nutrient that facilitates the transport of the body's energy sources. Unfortunately, dialysis inherently depletes the patient of carnitine. Carnitine deficiency results in heart disease, low red blood cell count, and muscle weakness. Supplementation is often necessary for dialysis patients if dialysis is going to be regularly performed for periods longer than one month. Taurine DeficiencyTaurine is an amino acid of animal protein origin. As is the case with carnitine, taurine is lost in the process of dialysis. Taurine deficiency can result in heart disease and (in cats) blindness if it is allowed to persist. This amino acid must be supplemented for long-term dialysis patients. Problems with the Dialysis CatheterThe dialysis catheter may create a blood clot at the catheter tip. This can interfere with the high blood flow rates necessary for proper dialysis. When a clot occurs, a forceful flushing of the catheter may be enough to move it. If not, clot-dissolving medications must be used and this becomes expensive and may lead to inability to clot. Infection from the Dialysis CatheterAn infected dialysis catheter is bad news. The resulting blood infection can be lethal and, at best, requires months of antibiotic therapy. Be aware of reddening skin or pus at the catheter site. A fever is of great concern so become familiar with taking the pet's temperature. Continual Renal Replacement Therapy Continual renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is another form of blood filtration similar to dialysis; in fact, which procedure is the best choice for the human patient is hotly debated in human medicine. While dialysis removes toxins built up over the previous couple of days over a 3 to 5-hour treatment period, CRRT involves continual removal over a 24 to 48-hour period that mimics the patient's natural kidney function more closely. The idea here is to continually remove toxins until they are all gone if that is possible. Sometimes, a couple of treatments are needed. Unlike dialysis, CRRT is not a regularly performed procedure. The catheters are similar to the dialysis catheters, but because the procedure requires being hooked to the equipment for up to two days, sedation is generally required for this entire period, although this depends on the hospital. Lower blood flow rates are used in CRRT when compared to hemodialysis, which makes for fewer blood pressure issues. Also, the dialysis complications that are seen over time (carnitine deficiency, high dietary calorie requirement, catheter infection, and most of the other issues listed above) are not problems with CRRT because CRRT is a one-time treatment. Sedation may be necessary for CRRT, depending on the facility. Blood cleansing therapies such as these are still new to the veterinary field because their use is high maintenance and costly. Aspet insurancebecomes more popular, expense becomes less of a deterrent, so more facilities are likely to open up. At the present time, dialysis is chiefly used on a temporary basis for acute conditions, but as treatment becomes more available and affordable, more chronic patients are likely to come forward. If dialysis is something you want to consider, let your veterinarian know so that you can be directed to the appropriate specialist. Costs vary and will depend on your pet's health status, the number of treatments necessary, and the facility. Your veterinarian can refer you to the closest facility, andThe American Society of Veterinary Nephrology and Urology(specializing in the kidneys and the larger urinary system) offers a list of facilities in North America. We hope to add more centers as they open.

Category: How to Find a Good, Responsible Breeder
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  People seek out purebred dogs and cats for a number of reasons. Previous experience with the breed; predictability of temperament or health; use in hunting, agility, obedience, or other work are just a few. Many purebred animals are found in animal shelters and rescue organizations. Breed-specific rescues only take in a specific breed, or mixes of that one breed. Once in a while they have puppies and kittens available for adoption, but not usually. If these avenues are not turning up any animals of your preferred breed, you might then choose to look for a breeder. Not all breeders are alike, so look for specific criteria to satisfy yourself that the breeder is responsible. Primarily, avoid any commercial breeder that displays the hallmarks of being a puppy mill. They are large-scale commercial breeding operations, usually for dogs (although the term can also be applied for large-scale catteries), where profit is the only thought. The temperament and health of any one animal or their parents is of no concern. The hundreds of animals are bred too often and in substandard, sometimes filthy, accommodations. Most pet store animals are sourced from operations that can be classified as puppy mills. Generally speaking, these operations are where you will find the least expensive animals because they are merely a commodity to the breeder. When buying puppies or kittens, it's usually true that you get what you pay for. Puppy mill dogs tend to be timid, fearful, and unhealthy throughout their lives, costing you a lot in emotional terms and at the veterinary hospital. You will likely spend less in veterinary bills over the pet's life by purchasing from a responsible breeder. A good, responsible breeder is one who cares about their animals-and you as their potential family-more than their own profit. A good breeder wants their animals to be placed in the best possible homes. The cost may seem high, but there is a significant investment by breeders in breeding responsible litters. This may include participating in conformation shows (which is where “champions” come from), testing for medical certifications, selectively planning litters that will improve the breed, keeping up with veterinary care needed during breeding and pregnancy, and finding good homes for their animals. Good breeders make little, if any, profit and do it for love of the breed. While many breeders look like they do the right thing on paper, that may not always true. Be wary of buying from people who only want to breed a litter because they know a friend has a purebred male for their female, or who want to have a litter so that their children can see "the magic of birth just once". They may produce good offspring, and they may not. Understand that being registered only means the pet has a purebred pedigree from the presiding organization for that animal. Being registered means nothing in terms of their health or temperament. Your Search Do your research before you look at a litter. It is impossible to make rational decisions while surrounded by adorable puppies or kittens! Good breeders Purchasing a pet through a reputable breeder takes time. Most reputable breeders have fewer than one to two litters per year. Good breeders also have waiting lists of potential buyers because experienced buyers know that a well-bred pet is worth the wait and cost. You are not likely to decide to buy a purebred animal one week and be able to pick one up the next without resorting to a pet store or puppy mill. One important hallmark of a good breeder is that if at any time during the pet's life you discover you cannot keep the animal, the breeder will take them back. This willingness means they care deeply about what happens to the animals they decide to bring into the world. A good breeder also tries to determine if you are the right kind of person to live with that breed. Don't be surprised when breeders ask you as many questions as you are asking them. Buyer Beware Once the purchase of a pet is complete, no breeder has the right to micro-manage your pet's diet or health care unless you co-own the animal. Be wary of breeders who seem opposed to you seeking your own veterinary care or have an antagonistic attitude towards veterinarians in general. A breeder may require you to sign a contract stating that you will feed a specific diet or give specific supplements. Some may stipulate which vaccines or parasite prevention to give (or not give) and when. Some may dictate the time frame in which to spay or neuter your pet, or even require/forbid specific anesthetic or drug protocols for the surgery. Some contracts require you to agree to intermittent in-home welfare checks, or to seek the breeder's permission before euthanizing your pet for any reason. Signing contracts like these is a bad idea, even if they may not be legally enforceable. The pet, and all the decisions related to their care, is legally yours. Your pet is an individual, and their medical decisions should be resolved between you and your veterinarian. Obviously, your breeder will be a good resource for health recommendations for their particular breed; however, insisting that you do something their way rather than what you and your veterinarian think best is inappropriate. When you are looking for a purebred puppy or kitten, for your own protection, don't buy from anyone who: You will be living with this pet for many years, and you want the most appropriate animal for that place in your heart: the best temperament, the best health, the best chances, and the least risk. Just because an animal is registered as a purebred does not mean it's a great pet: it's the breeder who makes the difference. Start by buying that puppy or kitten from a breeder who only wants what is best for the animals they're sharing with you.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The Nest Box Keep the babies together as long as they are about the same age; this will help socialize them to their own species and will help in keeping them warm. Try to assemble the following equipment. If the baby's temperature drops below 94⁰F, the heart rate drops and intestinal motion ceases.Death occurs if this is not corrected. Initial warming when babies have gotten cold should take place over an hour or two to avoid shock. The Diet Makeshift Formula Until Commercial Formula can be Obtained Puppies1 cup whole milk1 tsp. salad oil1 drop multi-vitamins (if you have any)2 egg yolks Kittens1/2 cup whole milk1 egg yolk1 drop multi-vitamins3 crushed Tums (antacid) For either one, then mix in a blender. The Bottle How / When To Feed Tube feeding involves using a syringe and lubricated tube to introduce formula through the mouth and directly into the stomach. Your veterinarian will need to show you how to do this should it become necessary. A baby who rejects three meals in a row will need tube feeding. Urination / Defecation Expect the baby to need stimulation for urination/defecation for the first three weeks of life. Bathing How to be Sure You Are on Track Starting Solid Food The best way to be sure everything is going well is to track weight gain in your new babies. A postal scale or food scale (ideally one that measures weight in grams) will be helpful. A puppy or kitten should gain 10% of the birth weight every day and should be drinking 22 to 26 cc of formula per 100 grams of body weight over the course of the day. Puppies are variable in growth expectancy depending on breed, but kittens are more predictable and should gain 50 to 100 grams weekly. Kittens weighing less than 90 grams (approx three ounces) at birth have a high (59%) mortality rate. A Note on Colostrum Colostrum is the first milk produced by the mother shortly after giving birth. It is rich in antibodies which will protect the babies for the first several months of life. Colostrum is only produced for a day or two and the baby is only able to absorb its antibodies for a day or two. Without colostrum (if their mother did not nurse the kittens during the first two days of life) the babies have a serious immunological disadvantage. Especially great care should be taken in cleanliness and the babies can be vaccinated as early as age two weeks depending on circumstances. They may require a plasma transfusion to make up for the colostrum. There is no substitute for a real mother. See more information onraising orphan kittens. Many foster parents have difficulty distinguishing male and female kittens at this early age. See someguidelines and (illustrated) instructions.

Category: Pregnant Dog Care
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Are you getting ready for the pitter-patter of little paws? As with humans, you can minimize pregnancy complications with proper care. Having puppies may sound easy, and it may seem like the dog does all the work, but that is not always how it turns out. So, our first assumption is that the litter is wanted (if not necessarily planned). If the litter is not wanted, consider that there is a terrible canine overpopulation problem, with some shelters euthanizing over 100 dogs DAILY. If your litter is not wanted, please think aboutspayingthe pregnant female or having amedical abortion. Spaying can be performed at any stage in pregnancy; abortion can only be performed during a certain period. Finding homes for puppies is challenging, and there are a limited number of homes to go around, so if there is any question, it may be best to take this opportunity to spay. Now, having covered that point, we will get on with the subject of caring for a pregnant dog. The female dog is pregnant for an average of 63 days. Plan accordingly. Diet The expectant mother will gradually require increasing amounts of food to nourish her developing litter. A food approved for growth (i.e. a puppy food or a performance diet) will certainly be necessary during the nursing period, and pregnancy may be a good time to transition into this new diet. About three weeks into the pregnancy, she may experience a little nausea and appetite loss, similar to morning sickness. This should resolve within a week, so if an upset stomach or loss of appetite lasts longer than that or is accompanied by listlessness, something more serious is going on, and you should notify your veterinarian. Calcium supplementation may be tempting, but is not a good idea. As long as the expectant mother is on a quality diet, supplementation is unnecessary. Furthermore, supplementation can suppress her natural calcium-releasing hormones so that when she really needs extra calcium during nursing, she will not have the proper hormone balance to get it. This can create a very dangerous situation that could easily be avoided by not supplementing with calcium. At 30 days of pregnancy, bring the female dog to the veterinarian for a wellness check-up and to possibly confirm the pregnancy with a blood test or ultrasound. Exercise Regular walking helps the expectant mother keep up her strength, but intensive training, showing, or even obedience school is probably too stressful. Obesity is a dangerous problem for pregnant dogs, and serious blood sugar regulation problems can put the litter at risk. Still, even if the mother-to-be is overweight, pregnancy is not the time for a weight loss program. Your veterinarian will help guide you regarding the optimal nutrition plan for your individual dog. During the final three weeks of pregnancy, the mother dog should be completely isolated from other dogs at home (see below). This means no walks in public during this stage and no contact with housemate dogs. The reason for this is to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases, especially the canineherpes virus. Vaccination A female dog should not be vaccinated during pregnancy; there are normal ingredients in the vaccine that could be harmful to the developing fetus. Ideally, the female should be vaccinated just before breeding. She will be passing on her immunity to her pups in the first milk she produces (milk called colostrum), so we want her antibody levels to be at their peak, yet we want to avoid vaccination during pregnancy. Parasite Control If the expectant mother uses a heartworm preventive, she may continue to do so during pregnancy, but be aware that not all products are approved for pregnant and nursing mothers. To see which products have been approved,click here. Flea control is important during pregnancy, though it is more important after the puppies are born. It is important to use a safe product during pregnancy. To find a product approved for pregnancy and lactation, see ourflea product comparison chart. Roundwormscan be transmitted from the pregnant mother to her unborn puppies, andhookwormscan be transmitted via nursing.  This is a nuisance as you usually end up with both an infected mother and infected puppies, but fortunately, there are several deworming protocols to control these infections. If you have concerns about internal parasites in puppies, speak to your vet about worm control. Daily medication will likely be needed, but worm-free puppies can be born. Isolate the Mother to Prevent Herpes Infection Canine herpesvirus infection causes a minor cold in adult dogs but can cause abortion in pregnancy as well as death in newborn puppies. The best way to prevent infection is to isolate the mother completely during the three weeks before delivery and the three weeks after delivery. This means absolutely no contact with other dogs. Around Day 45 Just before isolation, it is a good idea for the expectant mother to have a radiograph of her belly to count puppies. Mineralization of the fetal skeleton takes place around day 45 and thereafter can be seen on radiographs. Knowing how many puppies to expect will tell you when she is finished delivering. Labor and Complications of Delivery There is always the possibility of a problem with delivery, and you will need to be able to recognize labor when it is occurring, what is normal, and what is a sign you need to see the veterinarian for assistance.

Category: Jerky Dog Treats from China may be Associated with Kidney Issues
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The chicken jerky treats made in China have been associated with kidney disease for a few years. Ever since the association between these products and illness was made in 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cautioned consumers to not give these treats to their pets. While the treats are typically referred to as jerky, they may also be labeled tenders or strips. Signs may occur within hours or days after a dog eats the treat. Signs include decreased appetite; lethargy; vomiting; diarrhea (sometimes bloody); and increased thirst and urination. Contact your veterinarian if the signs last for more than 24 hours, or if they seem severe. If your dog is vomiting, lethargic, or does not want to eat, and has recently eaten these jerky treats, it does not automatically mean your dog has kidney disease from them. Test results on affected dogs have shown kidney problems. The kidney problems are often similar to Fanconi disease. (Fanconi disease is an inherited disease in which electrolytes and nutrients are lost in urine.)  Although many affected dogs can be treated and get well, some jerky treat-related deaths have been reported.In 2007, affected dogs were seen in Australia and the United States. That original outbreak ended in 2009 after all the affected treats had been pulled from the market. However, similar cases have been seen since then in the United States and Canada. Unfortunately, the definitive cause of the problem is still unknown. The FDA has prepared a“Caution” statement. In June 2011, the Canadian government sent out notices about the about jerky treats causing Fanconi-like signs in Canadian dogs; in March 2012, the American Veterinary Medical Association sent out a new alert aboutCanadian cases. In May 2012, theFDA updated their public informationon their concerns about chicken jerky. The FDA continues to investigate complaints and test products eaten by affected dogs. No specific brands have been recalled as of this time because there are only complaints, not evidence. However, there are a number of dogs with some level of kidney illness who have eaten the China-produced chicken jerky treats, so pet owners should be cautious about giving those. Anecdotal reports from veterinarians indicate similar concerns about sweet potato pet treats made in China. Although no evidence is available that these sweet potato treats cause kidney issues similar to those related to chicken jerky treats, pet owners should be aware of the possibility. If your pet has the signs listed above, and has eaten chicken jerky or sweet potato treats made in China, contact your veterinarian. Save the treats and packaging so that they can be tested by the FDA if they are suspected to cause the illness.

Category: Lymphoma Treatment Includes Nutritional Therapy for Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Additional Resources After a diagnosis of cancer has been confirmed, many pet owners seek nutritional advice in an effort to address the disease from another angle. The fact is that no supplement or dietary approach is going to kill tumor cells directly; there is no secret super nutrient with cancer-killing properties. Instead, the goals of nutrition for the cancer patient focus on preserving body condition:  maintaining a good appetite, maintaining a healthy body weight and maintaining muscle mass. Beyond this, people wonder if there is a nutritional strategy that might put a tumor at a disadvantage: Not a cancer-killing super-nutrient per se but more of a general program that might create an edge over a regular commercial pet food. Several theories have emerged on how this might be done but, unfortunately, a lot of scientific evidence has not followed. Here are commonly employed strategies: Let's look at these more closely. Low Carb Diet Cancers tend to use anaerobic metabolism, in part because they do not have normal structure or blood vessel support, and inadequate blood to a tissue means inadequate oxygen, and inadequate oxygen means anaerobic metabolism. Anaerobic metabolism burns carbohydrates rather than fats. There are actually more complex reasons for tumors to go anaerobic beyond not having a proper blood supply but the fact is that tumors tend to want to burn carbohydrates while healthy tissues want to burn fats. The theory of the low-carb diet is that fewer carbohydrates coming in means less food for the tumor. This theory is of some controversy but if you wish to feed such a diet, it is important to seek a food with less than 20 percent carbohydrates. Be aware that grain-free diets are usually not low in carbohydrates. Grain-free diets cater to the idea that some animals are not tolerant of grain proteins so these foods employ potatoes, yams or similar vegetables as carbohydrate sources. Recently grain-free diets have been implicated inheart diseaseso it is best not to feed them unless there is a reason to do so, such asfood allergy. Raw Foods Raw foods have some advantages over cooked foods. They are frequently more palatable than cooked foods. Because they are uncooked, their proteins are unaltered by the cooking process and may be less allergenic. There is some argument that raw foods are more digestible than cooked foods because they more closely match the diet that an animal evolved to digest. On the flip side of this is bacterial contamination, a very real concern and a special risk for a cancer patient whose immune system is probably altered. There have been numerous studies showing pathogenic bacteria in raw foods (both home prepared and commercially obtained). The last thing a cancer patient needs is a bacterial intestinal infection, so most experts recommend against raw foods especially for patients who have cancer. Home Cooking Home cooking can provide a highly palatable food for a patient with a sensitive appetite. The problem is that there is an abundance of recipes that turn out to be nutritionally incomplete when compared to the National Research Council (NRC) minimum requirements. Obviously, the cancer patient needs at least the same nutrition as a healthy patient. Pet nutrition, especially when disease is involved, is not a do-it-yourself project where one assembles ingredients that seem whole and healthy and attempts to complete the diet with a multivitamin. If you are going to cook food for a pet, it is vital to have professional guidance beyond a web site that looks knowledgeable or a book that seems scholarly. A professional nutritionist should be consulted and this means a veterinarian who is a diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Nutrition. Some helpful resources include ACVN.org and BalanceIt.com It is not clear if anything more can be achieved with a home cooked diet as opposed to a commercially prepared one but many people feel more comfortable making foods free of artificial preservatives or flavor enhancers. The main goal is to provide a palatable but still nutritionally complete food for the patient. Omega 3 Fatty Acids What is a fatty acid? Biochemically, a fatty acid is what we colloquially call plain old fat.  A fatty acid consists of a long carbon chain  (say 20 or so carbons in length) with a biochemical acid group at one end. But there are different kinds of fat. Some fats are stored and burned as fuels and some fats form the structure of our cell membranes. It is these fatty acids that are recruited in the inflammatory cascade to be converted into prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. Omega 3 fatty acids are similarly recruited but do not convert to inflammatory mediators. Examples of omega three fatty acids, also called n-3 fatty acids, include alpha linolenic acid (ALA); Eicosopentanoic acid (EPA); and docosahexanoic acid (DHA). Saturated Vs. Unsaturated There is more evidence for omega 3 fatty acid having anti-cancer properties at high doses. The best source of DHA and EPA is cold water fish oils. Flax seed oil is a good source of ALA and is preferred by many people who want the benefits of an omega 3 fatty acid without the fishy taste. ALA, unfortunately, is not a very useful omega 3 fatty acids for dogs and cats so DHA and EPA are needed. Luckily, most pets like the fishy smell and taste. Examples of omega three fatty acids (also called n-3 fatty acids): Alpha linolenic acid, Eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexanoic acid. An excellent source is cold water fish oils. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to inhibit the growth and spread of cancer, plus they have anti-inflammatory properties. In the study that launched Hill's  n/d, a food for cancer patients, 32 dogs with lymphoma were divided randomly into two groups: one that received a diet heavy in menhaden fish oil and one that received a diet heavy in soy bean oil. Both groups also received chemotherapy withdoxorubicin. The dogs that received this omega 3 fatty acid diet went into remission sooner and stayed in remission longer than dogs that received the soy bean oil diet. Both the low carb and omega three fatty acid therapies are incorporated into some therapeutic diets available only at your clinic, which are canned food and for dogs only. Should my Dog Use this Diet? The Hill's n/d may be of tremendous benefit to a dog with lymphoma but there are a few caveats: Hollywood Brand Safflower Oil and Mycosis Fungoides There is a particularly difficult form of T-cell lymphoma called Mycosis fungoides. This type of lymphoma is limited to the skin and, like most T-cell forms of lymphoma, it is resistant to the usual lymphoma treatments. It seems there is some basis for using one of the omega 6 fatty acids: linoleum acid. There are two major brands of safflower oil on the market: Hain and Hollywood. Apparently Hollywood is the brand with the most linoleic acid and is the brand of choice in this somewhat controversial treatment. In one study using eight dogs with Mycosis fungoides (the skin T-cell form of lymphoma), six dogs achieved remission with no other therapy. Minimal adverse effects come with the use of this oil (if too much oil is used there is a possibility of pancreatitis but, in general, obesity from the fat is the only problem). Safflower oil is inexpensive and readily available.

Category: Nutrition and Exercise for Growing Puppies
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Some owners of a new puppy might not have had a puppy in many years, or it might be their first puppy, and veterinary recommendations about nutrition and exercise for the puppy's best long-term health can change over the years. With the proliferation of large breed-specific and all-life-stage diets, it's sometimes difficult to know what is marketing hype from pet food manufacturers, what level of exercise is safe, and what the veterinary community recommends. The choices can impact the puppy's health in years to come, so it's best to understand the recommendations so you can make an informed choice. First and foremost, talk to your veterinarian with any questions about your puppy. Your veterinarian is likely to become your puppy’s healthcare specialist for years to come, and getting to know you and your puppy is important. Nutrition Q:What are the recommendations of veterinary nutritionists for switching pups and growing dogs onto adult maintenance diets? A:Dietary requirements of puppies differ from those of adult dogs. Mostly, they have different requirements for amino acids and for vitamins and minerals, especially calcium and phosphorus, which are required for bone growth. Of course, puppies also have a higher calorie requirement than adult dogs of a similar size — pups simply burn more energy! In order to meet the specialized nutritional needs of a puppy, it is important to feed a diet formulated for growth. Diets can be assessed for suitability by checking the Nutritional Adequacy Statement on the pet food label. This should indicate that it is appropriate for growing puppies or for all life stages. Pet foods can be proven to be complete and balanced for specific life stages based on the formulation method or by feeding tests. If the manufacturer is making a complete and balanced claim for the product based on the formulation method, the Nutritional Adequacy Statement will specify if the diet is adequate or not for puppies expected to be > 70 lb adults. Similarly, a diet may be marketed for large breed puppies and have a complete and balanced claim based on feeding tests. In that case, the manufacturer must use large breed puppies in the test (expected to be > 70 lb adults) or they can use any size puppies as long as the calcium and phosphorus concentrations are below the maximum limits in the Dog Food Nutrient Profiles established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). This label information is very helpful for evaluating whether a puppy diet is appropriate for larger breeds. An appropriate diet for growth should be fed until the dog reaches approximately 80% of the anticipated adult size. This generally occurs by 12 months of age for small and medium-breed dogs, and by 18-24 months for large and giant-breed dogs. Current conventional recommendations are to feed growth diets until this time, but feeding such a diet for a longer period will not be harmful. Care should be taken to ensure the dog maintains an ideal (lean) body condition, so keep in mind that growth diets may be fairly energy dense and could contribute to unwanted weight gain. As such, a controlled food intake is typically needed. Q:Is it necessary to feed puppies "puppy food" and adult dogs "adult maintenance food?” A:Yes – puppies have distinct nutritional needs. However, checking the Nutritional Adequacy Statement on the label is the best way to determine if the diet is appropriate for the specified life stage. Some foods marketed as maintenance diets based on the name or other front panel information are appropriate for "all life stages" as specified by the Nutritional Adequacy Statement on the back or side of the package. Q:What is the difference between “regular” and “large-breed” growth diets? A:The major difference is that large-breed growth diets are typically lower in calories, calcium, and phosphorus. This is to avoid excessive intake of minerals and to reduce the risk of overfeeding, which will lead to obesity – an all-too-common problem in today’s pets. Being overweight is an important risk factor for developmental orthopedic disease. In most cases, nutritionists recommend food that has passed AAFCO feeding tests for growth and that is made by a large, reputable pet-food company and marketed specifically for large-breed or giant-breed growth. All puppies should be kept lean throughout growth and beyond to promote health and longevity. Q:Can I harm my puppy by feeding an adult diet earlier than recommended? I need to limit calories by switching my giant-breed dog over to adult food at 6 months of age to reduce the growth rate. A:Puppies require growth diets to meet their needs. The broad category of “adult” diets encompasses a wide range of energy densities and nutrient profiles, so this advice is too vague to be useful and may be harmful. There are two specific reasons why this approach is not recommended. The first is that adult diets often have calcium-phosphorus ratios, or absolute amounts of these minerals (as well as other essential nutrients), that are inappropriate for growing giant-breed dogs. This can affect bone development in these breeds, who are still undergoing rapid growth at 6 months and beyond. The second reason is that diets marketed as adult foods may be as (or more!) energy-dense as those marketed as puppy diets, especially if they are formulated to meet AAFCO nutrient profiles for all life stages (which is the same as growth/gestation/lactation formulations). It is best to simply control the calories consumed by regularly assessing the puppy's body condition and appropriately adjusting the amount fed to maintain leanness. The recommendation to switch to adult foods at 6 months of age, or to use adult foods for large and giant breed puppies, is outdated and potentially very harmful. Large-breed growth diets, which have been specifically created to help reduce overfeeding as well as meet the requirements of growing large-breed dogs, should be used. Q:How can I limit calorie intake in my growing giant-breed puppy to reduce the growth rate? A:The easiest way is to adjust the amount of the growth diet. The correct amount of food is the amount that allows the growing dog to maintain a lean body condition score of 4/9 based on the guide originally developed by Purina. Learn to assess your puppy's body condition score (BCS) regularly and adjust the amount fed accordingly. This ensures that nutritional requirements are met but that growth is controlled to reduce the risk of developmental orthopedic disease. Not only do calorie needs change throughout growth, but growth rates and energy needs also vary between individual dogs, even siblings, so it’s best to choose a starting point and then adjust the diet to an individual puppy based on BCS. Q:What should I do if my puppy already has developmental orthopedic disease? A:If you are concerned your puppy has developmental orthopedic disease, the diet should be carefully evaluated and adjusted if necessary. Your veterinarian will be able to help discuss your concerns and can consult or recommend a consultation with a board-certified veterinary nutritionist for advice if necessary. Your veterinarian is also best able to help correct the orthopedic problem. Q:What should I do if my puppy is overweight or obese? A:Feed slightly less and increase low-impact activity such as swimming or leash walking. In most cases, reducing calorie intake while continuing to feed the large-breed growth diet should allow the dog to return to a normal body condition while maintaining appropriate balances of other nutrients. Specifically designed weight-loss diets are generally only recommended for adult dogs. If severe calorie restriction is necessary, this should be done in consultation with a board-certified veterinary nutritionist or your veterinarian. For these reasons, prevention is preferred. Q:Are there any homemade diets that I can give to my large-breed puppy? A:Not if you are looking for an off-the-shelf or out-of-the-book homemade diet. There is too much potential for error in estimating calcium and phosphorus as well as other essential nutrients. Several studies have shown that general recipes found in books or online are nutritionally inadequate which may result in potentially severe orthopedic disease and permanent disfigurement when fed during growth. In addition, homemade diets are more expensive compared to commercial options and require significant investments in time, effort, and space. If you are serious about feeding a balanced and appropriate homemade diet, consult with a board-certified veterinary nutritionist to formulate a customized recipe for your specific pet. Using a generic diet recipe is a recipe for disaster! Exercise Q:I want to take my large-breed puppy jogging or running. When is it safe for the puppy to go running? A:There are no hard and fast rules for exercising growing large-breed puppies. And there is even less scientific data supporting specific exercise loads in growing dogs. Therefore, common sense should prevail. Most young dogs (5-12 months) have enough energy to keep up with a person jogging, but not enough brains to know when to stop, so they would just keep going until they dropped – they’re like teenagers! Running and jogging is forced exercise for dogs; forced exercise is anything beyond what the puppy would do when playing with dogs of the same age. Unfortunately, the stresses that forced exercise places on a growing and immature skeletal system may result in long-term damage. Dogs with a predisposition to orthopedic disease such as hip dysplasia and that are restricted in their level of exercise during development have less severe issues than those given unlimited exercise. Since many of the larger breeds suffer from these joint diseases, it seems prudent to wait until growth plates close before subjecting them to vigorous and especially forced exercise. In most of these breeds, the growth plates close around 12 months. Waiting until these dogs are 12-15 months old, which allows adequate skeletal development, will allow you to enjoy many more years of exercising with your dog than you would if you allow risky activities such as excessive running and jumping. One reasonable analogy is that a 5 to 6-month-old dog is biologically equivalent to an 8 to 12-year-old child (i.e., a pre-pubescent). It is unreasonable to expect an 8-year-old child to run 3 to 5 miles per day with an adult at a pace of 8 minutes per mile. Another similar analogy is the horse industry, which races 2-year-old horses. The risk of carpal and other injuries in horses forced to gallop as 2-year-olds is substantially higher than in 3-year-olds because of immature growth plates and cartilage.  Q:What exercise is appropriate for my growing large-breed puppy? A:Puppies and growing dogs should not be forced to exercise. Remember, forced exercise is anything beyond what the puppy would do when playing with dogs of the same age. Thus, a 4-month-old dog running fences with adult dogs would be considered forced exercise. Similarly, running with people is forced exercise, as is excessive stick-chasing or disc-catching. Swimming, however, is not stressful on joints or bones, so dogs can be physically conditioned by appropriate and supervised swimming sessions. Also, remember that mental effort is very rewarding to a puppy and can be tiring as well – allowing exploration by scent (dogs love to sniff!) and of course, training are good ways to enrich and entertain your puppy.

Category: Omega Three Fatty Acids for our Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Did you know that skin diseases account for as much as 25% of the cases seen by small animal veterinarians? Skin problems typically faced by pets and their owners include: The nutritional aspect of skin disease is quite broad. There are true nutritional deficiencies that affect the skin and other skin diseases that can be made dramatically better by using supplements.Just because a condition responds to a nutrient does not necessarily mean that there is a deficiency of it.Everyone wants their pet to have a lustrous beautiful coat and would like to do what it nutritionally possible to ensure this. Recently essential fatty acids have received a great deal of press. A brief primer follows. What is a Fatty Acid? Biochemically, a fatty acid is what we just call fat. When we talk about different types of fatty acids, we are talking about different types of fat. A fatty acid consists of a long carbon chain (say 20 or so carbons in length) with biochemical acids called a carboxyl group at one end and a methyl group on the other end. Saturated Vs. Unsaturated Each carbon has four binding sites. In the carbon chain, two sites will be taken up by other carbons (i.e., the two adjacent carbons on the chain). In a saturated fat, the other two sites are taken up by hydrogen atoms. Saturated fats are typically solid at room temperature, like lard and butter, and are usually made from animals. Saturated fats are generally burned as fuel by our bodies. An example of a saturated fatty acid is depicted in the above illustration. Unsaturated fats have two adjacent carbons held together by a biochemical double bond. These fats are generally liquid at room temperature and come from plants, such as olive oil, corn oil, etc. Unsaturated fats can be classified as omega three fatty acids or omega six fatty acids, depending on the location of the double bond relative to the methyl group at the end of the chain. These types of fatty acids are essential, meaning that our bodies cannot make them; instead, we must eat them in our diet. These fats are not burned for fuel but are used as structural components. The omega six fatty acids are used as the main structural components in our cells. Omega three acids are used in the retina and central nervous system. For healthy skin and coat, the diet must contain adequate omega six fatty acids as these make up the surface of the skin.Examples of omega six fatty acids (also called n-6 fatty acids): Linoleic acid, gamma linolenic acid, and Arachidonic acid. Evening Primrose oil is an excellent example.Examples of omega three fatty acids, also called n-3 fatty acids, include: Alpha linolenic acid (ALA), Eicosatetraenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).Cold water fish oils are an excellent source of DHA and EPA. A terrific source of ALA would be flax seed oil. DHA has anti-inflammatory properties, which is why it is so frequently recommended in inflammatory conditions. Many people prefer to use flax seed oil as their omega 3 source because flax seed oil does not taste fishy and people readily convert ALA to DHA. This is great for people but it turns out that pets are only able to convert about 10% of ALA to DHA, so for them cold water fish oils are better. Fortunately, most dogs and cats like the fishy taste. Should we Supplement Essential Fatty Acids?There is no question that a diet must contain adequate omega 6 fatty acids to maintain optimal skin and coat quality. A diet found to be “complete and balanced” will have an amount of omega 6 fatty acids that should be optimal for a normal animal. But there’s more. Omega 6 Fatty Acids and DandruffResearch has shown that dogs with oily, dandruffy skin (seborrhea) have insufficient omega 6 fatty acids in their skin despite eating a diet that should be optimal. When omega 6 fatty acids are supplemented, the seborrhea improves. This finding supports the old-time remedy of adding a spoonful of corn oil to the diet to ensure a glossy coat. Seborrhea is a complex condition but animals with it may need more omega 6 fatty acids. Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Omega 3 Fatty AcidsOmega 6 fatty acids constitute our cell membranes. During some biochemical situations, it is necessary to produce hormone-like substances called prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These substances are made from omega 6 fatty acids and the resulting prostaglandins and leukotrienes are not necessarily good for us. In fact, these substances are responsible for itching and inflammation leading to the clinical skin problems listed above. One way to address this is to supplement omega 3 fatty acids, which become incorporated into cell membranes along with the omega 6s. After a couple of months of supplementation, omega 3 fatty acids infiltrate cell membranes significantly. When it comes time to make prostaglandins, the omega 3s are mobilized instead of the omega 6s only in this case, the prostaglandins that result are not inflammatory. When omega 3 fatty acids are supplemented, itching can be substantially reduced and even arthritis pain improved. One problem with this is that no one really knows how much omega 3 fatty acid to supplement. There is some evidence that a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids in the supplement is crucial. If this is so, clinical research becomes hugely complicated as the diets of pets cannot be standardized easily for study. If pets in a study eat different diets, then it is impossible to tell what overall omega 6:omega 3 ratio each is receiving. Essential fatty acids are being pursued as treatment for diseases of virtually every organ system; watch for new research in this area. Conditions that Have Been Shown to Benefit from Omega 3 Fatty Acid Supplementation Research is ongoing. We know that supplementing with omega 3 appears to be benign with the potential to do a great deal of good.

Category: People Foods to Avoid Feeding Your Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Chocolate, Macadamia nuts, avocados…these foods may sound delicious to you, but they’re actually quite dangerous for our animal companions. Our nutrition experts have put together a handy list of the top toxic people foods to avoid feeding your pet. As always, if you suspect your pet has eaten any of the following foods, please note the amount ingested and contact your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center at (888) 426-4435. To Be Avoided AlcoholAlcoholic beverages and food products containing alcohol can cause vomiting, diarrhea, decreased coordination, central nervous system depression, difficulty breathing, tremors, abnormal blood acidity, coma and even death. Under no circumstances should your pet be given any alcohol. If you suspect that your pet has ingested alcohol, contact your veterinarian or theASPCA Animal Poison Control Centerimmediately. AvocadoAvocado is primarily a problem for birds, rabbits, donkeys, horses, and ruminants, including sheep and goats. The biggest concern is cardiovascular damage and death in birds.  Horses, donkeys, and ruminants frequently get swollen, edematous head and neck. Chocolate, Coffee and CaffeineThese products all contain substances called methylxanthines, which are found in cacao seeds, the fruit of the plant used to make coffee, and in the nuts of an extract used in some sodas. When ingested by pets, methylxanthines can cause vomiting and diarrhea, panting, excessive thirst and urination, hyperactivity, abnormal heart rhythm, tremors, seizures, and even death. Note that darker chocolate is more dangerous than milk chocolate. White chocolate has the lowest level of methylxanthines, while baking chocolate contains the highest. CitrusThe stems, leaves, peels, fruit, and seeds of citrus plants contain varying amounts of citric acid, essential oils that can cause irritation and possibly even central nervous system depression if ingested in significant amounts. Small doses, such as eating the fruit, are not likely to present problems beyond minor stomach upset. Coconut and Coconut OilWhen ingested in small amounts, coconut, and coconut-based products are not likely to cause serious harm to your pet. The flesh and milk of fresh coconuts do contain oils that may cause stomach upset, loose stools or diarrhea. Because of this, we encourage you to use caution when offering your pets these foods. Coconut water is high in potassium and should not be given to your pet. Grapes and RaisinsAlthough the specific toxic substances within grapes and raisins are only suspected, these fruits can cause kidney failure in some pets. Until more information is known about the toxic substances, it is best to avoid feeding grapes and raisins to cats and dogs. Macadamia NutsMacadamia nuts can cause weakness, depression, vomiting, tremors, and hyperthermia in dogs. Signs usually appear within 12 hours of ingestion and can last approximately 12 to 48 hours. Milk and DairyBecause pets do not possess significant amounts of lactase (the enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk), milk and other dairy-based products cause them diarrhea or other digestive upset. NutsNuts, including almonds, pecans, and walnuts, contain high amounts of oils and fats. The fats can cause vomiting and diarrhea, and potentially pancreatitis in pets. Onions, Garlic, ChivesThese vegetables and herbs can cause gastrointestinal irritation and could lead to red blood cell damage. Although cats are more susceptible, dogs are also at risk if a large enough amount is consumed. Toxicity is normally diagnosed through history, clinical signs, and microscopic confirmation of Heinz bodies. Raw/Undercooked Meat, Eggs and BonesRaw meat and raw eggs can contain bacteria such as Salmonella and E. coli that can be harmful to pets and humans. Raw eggs contain an enzyme called avidin that decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin), which can lead to skin and coat problems. Feeding your pet raw bones may seem like a natural and healthy option that might occur if your pet lived in the wild. However, this can be very dangerous for a domestic pet, who might choke on bones or sustain a grave injury should the bone splinter and become lodged in or puncture your pet’s digestive tract. Salt and Salty Snack FoodsLarge amounts ofsaltcan produce excessive thirst and urination or even sodium ion poisoning in pets. Signs that your pet may have eaten too many salty foods include vomiting, diarrhea, depression, tremors, elevated body temperature, seizures, and even death. As such, we encourage you to avoid feeding salt-heavy snacks like potato chips, pretzels, and salted popcorn to your pets. XylitolXylitol is used as a sweetener in many products, including gum, candy, baked goods, and toothpaste. It can cause insulin release in most species, which can lead to liver failure. The increase in insulin leads to hypoglycemia (lowered sugar levels). Initial signs of toxicosis include vomiting, lethargy, and loss of coordination. Signs can progress to seizures. Elevated liver enzymes and liver failure can be seen within a few days. Yeast DoughYeast dough can rise and cause gas to accumulate in your pet’s digestive system. This can be painful and can cause the stomach to bloat and potentially twist, becoming a life-threatening emergency. The yeast produces ethanol as a by-product, and a dog ingesting raw bread dough can become drunk (see alcohol). The ASPCANational Animal Poison Controlis available 24 hours a day at 888-426-4435. Expect an initial consultation fee of around $100.00 and additional follow-up is at no charge. You will be assigned a case number your veterinarian can use to communicate with a toxicology specialist before beginning treatment. If your pet has aHomeAgainmicrochip, a free poison control consultation is included in the full-service registration.

Category: Weight Loss in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Excessive weight gain has become the most common preventable disease seen in dogs throughout the United States. As of 2020, the number of dogs in the U.S. that are overweight or obese (56%) surpassed the number of dogs at an appropriate weight (44%), and this stunning statistic continues to rise each year. Obesity is a major concern in dogs because it can increase their risk of getting a variety of serious medical conditions:diabetes mellitus,joint damageandarthritis,kidneyand pancreatic disease, cardiovascular issues, bladder, and urinary tract disease, skin problems, andcancer. Fortunately, losing weight can help these patients reduce that risk and even reverse some of the effects of these conditions. Weight gain in our four-legged companions can occur for a variety of reasons. Some diseases can lead to an increased risk of obesity in dogs, which is why it is always important to consult your veterinarian so they can examine your dog before recommending any dietary changes. In an otherwise healthy dog, weight gain is often due to an imbalance between the amount of calories they are eating and the amount that they are burning in their daily activity. This means obesity is one of the few conditions that plague our pets that we as owners can have some control over. To ensure that our dogs are maintaining a healthy weight, we need to focus on choosing an appropriate amount of a quality food, promoting exercise, monitoring weight changes, and adjusting the amount of food that they receive based on those changes. Whether you are trying to get your overweight dog back down to a healthy weight or prevent your dog from becoming overweight in the first place, here are some simple steps that you can follow to help you and your dog meet your goals. Determining Ideal Weight When it comes to helping a dog lose weight, the first step is determining what their ideal body weight should be. Consult your veterinarian, as they can assess your dog’sbody condition score(BCS) on a 9 point scale to help you understand your starting point. Your veterinarian can then use this BCS to establish an ideal weight for your dog and give you a reference point to track weight loss goals and progress. Dogs are considered overweight if they weigh 10-20% more than this ideal weight and obese if they are over 20% above it. A BCS of 4-5 is considered appropriate, so anything greater than 5 is overweight and anything less than 4 is underweight. Every 1-point increase or decrease from the ideal BCS score (4-5) is about 10-15% of their weight. For example, if your dog has a BCS of 6, they need to lose 10-15% of their body weight, whereas a dog with a BCS of 9 would need to lose 40-60% of their body weight. With this ideal weight in mind as the overall goal, you can set smaller weight loss goals for your dog of losing 1-2% of their body weight per week. It is important that dogs do not lose weight too quickly, as this could mean that they are missing out on essential nutrients, which could lead to other health problems. Maintaining Goal Weight Once you have your goal weight, your veterinarian will also help you determine your dog’s current food intake; this includes the type of food they eat, the amount they receive, how often they are fed (2-3 times per day, free feeding, etc.), and the amount of treats or extra food they are given. Feeding your pet’s daily ration over 2-3 isolated meals throughout the day is a great strategy to make it easier to monitor their intake. Also, eliminating treats, especially human food, is another easy way to cut out unnecessary calories. We know treats can be important for training and bonding, so you can use some of their daily ration of dog food as treats throughout the day if this is something that you do not want to give up.  Many veterinarians will also recommend switching to a therapeutic weight loss diet that is designed to ensure that your dog still gets all of the nutrients that they need but with fewer calories. In addition to regulating their food intake, making some lifestyle changes to increase your dog’s daily activity is another important step in the weight loss journey, as it will help them burn some extra calories. Simple activities like short walks, play dates, romps in the dog park, and throwing fetch in the backyard a few times a day can be extremely beneficial for meeting your dog’s weight loss goals and keeping the weight off in the future. Once your dog has returned to their ideal body weight, it is important to maintain some of these lifestyle changes so they can maintain that weight that you both have worked so hard to obtain. Now that you have established your dog’s ideal body weight, adjusted their food intake, and determined what lifestyle changes you are going to make, you are ready to put your plan into action. Your veterinarian can help you calculate the number of calories that your dog should be consuming each day and determine what type of food would be most beneficial for your individual dog. Somewhat severe calorie restriction is often necessary to achieve the goal of losing 1-2% of their body weight in a week, so veterinarians will typically recommend decreasing their food intake by around 15-20% per day and monitoring their progress by weighing them at the clinic every 2-3 weeks. Monitoring your pet’s weight is one of the most important parts of this process, as you may have to further decrease their intake if they are not achieving their goals in an appropriate amount of time. Although it may seem somewhat minor due to the large number of dogs that are affected, obesity is a serious disease that can lead to a lot of other major health problems in our four-legged friends. Fortunately, as owners, we can make some simple dietary and lifestyle changes to help our dogs maintain a healthy weight that will increase not only the length but also the quality of their life. Some of these changes can be difficult for both you and your dog to adjust to, but if you stick to your plan and work with your veterinarian, it will certainly be worth it The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Ticks Are Arthropod Parasites for Mammals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Ticks are skin parasites that feed on the blood of their hosts. Ticks like motion, warm temperatures from body heat, and the carbon dioxide exhaled by mammals, so they are attracted to such hosts as dogs, cats, rodents, rabbits, cattle, small mammals, etc. The bite itself is not usually painful, but the parasite can transmit diseases and causetick paralysis, which is why tick control is so important. (Removing the ticks leads to rapid improvement of the paralysis.) The minimal amount of time it takes for an attached tick to transmit disease is not known. The time it takes to transmit diseases is affected by the type of disease organism, the species of tick, etc. However, in general, if a tick is removed within 16 hours, the risk of disease transmission is considered to be very low. Therefore, owners can usually prevent disease transmission to their pets by following a regular schedule to look for and remove ticks. The Tick Life Cycle Most types of ticks require three hosts during a 2-3 year lifespan.  Each tick stage requires a blood meal before it can reach the next stage. Hard ticks have four life stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Larvae and nymphs must feed before they detach and molt. Adult female ticks can engorge, increasing their weight by more than 100-fold. After detaching, an adult female tick can lay approximately 3,000 eggs. During the egg-laying stage, ticks lay eggs in secluded areas with dense vegetation. The eggs hatch within two weeks. Some species of ticks lay 100 eggs at a time, while others lay 3,000 to 6,000 per batch. Once the eggs hatch, the ticks are in the larval stage, during which time the larvae move into the grass and search for their first blood meal. At this stage, they will attach themselves for several days to their first host, usually a bird or rodent, and then fall onto the ground. The nymph stage begins after the first blood meal is completed. Nymphs remain inactive during winter and start moving again in spring. Nymphs find a host, usually a rodent, pet, or human. Nymphs are generally about the size of a freckle. After this blood meal, ticks fall off the host and move into the adult stage. Throughout the autumn, male and female adults find a host, which is again usually a rodent, pet, or human. The adult female feeds for 8 to 12 days. The female mates while still attached to her host. Both ticks fall off, and the males die. The female remains inactive through the winter and in the spring lays her eggs in a secluded place. If adults cannot find a host animal in the fall, they can survive in leaf litter until the spring. What are the best ways to deal with these blood-sucking parasites? Outdoor Environmental Control Treating the yard and outdoor kennel area with acaricides (tick pesticides) is an important tool in the arsenal against ticks. Some products can be used to spray the outdoor area. However, you should not rely on spraying to reduce your risk of infection. If you have health concerns about applying acaricides, check with local health or agricultural officials about the best time toapply acaricides in your area, identify rules and regulations related to pesticide application on residential properties, and consider using a professional pesticide company to apply pesticides at your home. You can also create a tick-safe zone in your yard by using some simple landscaping techniques that can help reduce tick populations: Indoor Environmental ControlIf ticks are indoors, flea and tick foggers, sprays, or powders can be used. Inside, ticks typically crawl (they don't jump) and may be in cracks around windows and doors. A one-foot barrier of insecticide, where the carpeting and wall meet, can help with tick control. Preventing Ticks from Attaching If your pet goes outside regularly, you can use some type of residual insecticide on your pet. Talk to your veterinarian about what works best in your geographic area. If you use a liquid spray treatment, cats and skittish dogs typically prefer a pump bottle because of the noise from aerosol cans. Doubling the amount of anti-tick product, or using two at once, may cause toxicity problems.Any spray insecticide labeled for use on clothing should not be sprayed directly on pets. Powders are fairly easy to apply, but they can be messy. (Avoid topical powders if your pet has a respiratory condition.) Shampoos are useful only for ticks that are already on your pet. A tick collar might be somewhat more water-resistant than a residual insecticide, so if your dog likes to swim, the collar might be a better choice. Flea combs can be used to help remove ticks and wash your pet's bedding frequently. Finding and Removing Ticks The best way to find ticks on your pet is to run your hands over the whole body. Check for ticks every time your pet comes back from an area you know is inhabited by ticks. Ticks attach most frequently around the pet's head, ears, neck, and feet, but they are not restricted to those areas. There are several tick removal devices on the market, but a plain set of fine-tipped tweezers will remove a tick quite effectively. How To Remove A Tick With Tweezers Risk of disease transmission to you, while removing ticks, is low but you should wear gloves if you wish to be perfectly safe. Do not apply hot matches, petroleum jelly, turpentine, nail polish, or just rubbing alcohol alone. These methods do not remove the ticks and they are not safe for your pet. Rubbing alcohol could be used to disinfect the area before or after removing the tick. Watch for Infection and Diseases After you pull a tick off, there will be a local area of inflammation that could look red, crusty, or scabby. The tick’s attachment causes irritation. The site can get infected; if the pet is scratching at it, it is more apt to get infected. A mild topical antibiotic, such as over-the-counter triple antibiotic ointment, can help but usually is not necessary. The inflammation should go down within a week. If it stays crusty and inflamed longer than a week, it might have become infected. Various diseases can be transmitted by ticks includinganaplasmosis,babesiosis,ehrlichiosis,Lyme disease,tick paralysis(or tick toxicosis), and others. Not all species of animals (pets or not) are affected similarly by every tick-borne illness. Although ticks can transmit diseasescontracted from a previous hostto pets and humans, they are usually nothing more than a nuisance. The best approach is to prevent them from embedding and once embedded, to remove them quickly. If you notice your pet experiencing signs of illness or acting differently after a tick bite, it is always best to see your veterinarian. If you stay on top of the situation, your pets should cruise right through the tick season with no problems.

Category: Treating your Yard for Fleas and Ticks
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If fleas and ticks have been a problem for you, there are three areas you have to treat to be successful in treating fleas. One is treating your pets with an effective product; two is your house with a growth regulator; and the third is your yard. If you don’t have a fenced yard, it will be impossible to get total flea control because stray animals will be continually bringing in fleas and their eggs to your property and will expose your pets. However, you can spray around your house as far as is reasonable, and if you have a fenced yard, you can do a good job eliminating most fleas. When asked about yard treatment, many folks indicate that their yards are treated by a professional pest control company and most of those companies use a product called bifenthrin, which is in the pyrethroid family. Pyrethroids are manmade versions of pyrethrins, which come from chrysanthemum flowers. Bifenthrin works by interfering with the nervous system of insects when it is touched or eaten by the insect and is considered more toxic to insects than mammals due to their smaller size and lower body temperature. Due to factors such as sprinklers, mowing, and rain, lawn care companies may recommend multiple applications of the bifenthrin-containing product to be effective. In fact, I recommend to clients treating their own yard for fleas to treat once weekly for 4 weeks and then once a month to kill the young larval stages as they hatch because spraying will not kill the eggs. Tremors and seizures are listed as potential adverse effects of pyrethrin toxicosis (bifenthrin is a pyrethrin). Most of these products are safe for pets but the pets must be kept off the sprayed yard until it is dry. Pets exposed to bifenthrin can develop vomiting or diarrhea, twitching of the ears, paw flicking, increased drooling, hyperactivity, incoordination, diarrhea, depression, and dilated pupils. Seek veterinary care if some of these signs occur.

Category: CBD Use in Dogs: An Update
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English CBD Use in Dogs: An Update Cannabidiol, or CBD, has been used for several years in dogs. Results of arthritis treated with CBD are positive, although most studies used higher dosages than recommended. The first study published actually measuring the dog’s gait on a plate did not find any effect on decreasing arthritis. CBD has been used for epilepsy, and is reported anecdotally to be effective, but was not effective in the majority of cases with treatment resistant epilepsy. CBD has been found to be somewhat effective when used for anxiety and fear-based aggression. One study did show decreased aggression from anxiety and, in many dogs, improved behavior. CBD has shown to reduce growth of some cancer cells in the lab. Contaminants are always a concern when giving your pet any neutraceutical, as there is very little testing required and these products are not regulated by the FDA. Dr. Robert Silver, DVM, MS, said in dvm360 Magazine that CBD seems to be safe if the recommended dosages are followed and the product does not contain contaminants, and is more absorbable if given with food. Concerns about interactions with other drugs and other herbs exist, as no studies have been performed to determine this issue. CBD has been shown to increase the alkaline phosphatase levels in the blood due to enzyme induction in the liver. Symptoms of CBD toxicity include vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, slow or fast heart rate, rapid breathing and pale gums and other mucous membranes. There are still many unknown facts about CBD in dogs, but studies are slowly being performed to answer these questions.

Category: Applying Eye Drops with Low Stress Handling™
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English At some point in many dogs’ lives, they will require eye drops. This might be a one-time event to examine the eye or it may be multiple times per day to treat chronic disease. Regardless of the cause, applying eyedrops need not be a struggle for you or the pet, whether at home or in a clinic setting. The same approach works in both places. Gather everything you need: A comfortable place for you and the pet. For small pets this might be on a table, on a chair, or even on your lap if the pet is comfortable there. For large dogs, leave them on the floor. Items for positive reinforcement and distraction: typically food, but a toy will work well for some pets. You may want or need something the pet can lick the food off (for example, a spoon with a dab of peanut butter). The eye drops/medication to be given. Get set up comfortably: Avoid bending over or toward your pet, it is best to crouch to the side or behind the pet. Keep your posture as upright as possible so there is no sense of urgency due to impending back/neck pain. If you are prepared to take your time, your pet won’t pick up on your anxiety cues. Have the dog seated or standing, looking at you or at a right angle. Large dogs can rest their chin on your leg, or the edge of the couch or a chair to decrease downward motion. These are behaviors that can be taught; in a pinch, you can lure a dog to do them with some food. Giving the eye drops or ointment Uncap the eye drop bottle or ointment tube. Get the bottle in position near your pet’s eye. (The photo to the left shows how you want to be positioned.) Hold the bottle or tube horizontally or tilted up so it is not dribbling on the pet. Positioning your hand is typically least stressful when coming from underneath and behind the ear as if you are petting the dog. Rest the outside/pinky edge of your hand on the dog’s head, behind their eyebrow. This should preferably be just outside of their peripheral vision. (See example to the left.) If your dog is concerned about this positioning, do a few rounds of counter conditioning by moving your hand closer and closer to this position and feeding food just after hand placement so that your hand touching their head means food is coming. You are most stable with your hand and wrist on the dog’s head, which requires placing the target eye away from you. Since you are slightly above the dog, make a kissy or smoochy noise, or say their name in a high-pitched happy tone to get them to look up. This opens their eyes wider for you. Quickly drop in the drop/ ointment without touching the lid or the eye – gravity does most of the work for you. Follow with food from your other hand or use it for the entire duration of the process if needed. There will be more head motion if the dog is eating while you attempt to drop in the drop/ointment, but your hand will move with their head. If you need to put drops in both eyes, some dogs will allow you to shift immediately to the other eye. Some dogs need a short break, and you’ll need to repeat the process.

Category: Brushing your Dog's Teeth
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What would happen if you stopped brushing your own teeth? Even if you only ate hard food, as most dogs do, there still would be problems. You should be brushing your dog's teeth twice daily if you can manage it; it’s not as difficult as you might imagine. What are the benefits of brushing? Brushing removes daily accumulation of plaque from the teeth. Even though dogs do not commonly get cavities, they do suffer from periodontal disease. If untreated, gum disease can lead to bad breath, pain, and tooth loss. How Do You Brush Your Dog's Teeth? Step oneis to pick an appropriate pet toothbrush. Save yourself time by not buying a child's toothbrush, which is usually too hard for dogs. The ideal dog toothbrush will have a long handle, an angled head to better fit the mouth, and extra soft bristles. For dogs less than 30 pounds, a finger toothbrush that fits over the tip of your finger works well. Step twois to select an appropriate toothpaste. The best pet toothpastes contain enzymes that help control plaque. Try to avoid toothpastes with baking soda, detergents, or salt that are sometimes found in human pastes. Fluoride may be incorporated to help control bacteria. Place the toothpaste between the bristles as this allows the paste to spend the most time next to the teeth and gums. Step threeis to get the brush with paste into your dog's mouth to get all the teeth brushed. Most dogs accept brushing if they are approached in a gentle manner. If you can start when they are young, it's quite easy, but even older pets will accept the process. Start slowly; you can use a damp washcloth or piece of gauze to wipe the teeth, front and back in the same manner you will eventually be using the toothbrush. Praise your dog during the process and offer teeth-healthy treats, such as dental chews, as a reward. Do this twice daily for two weeks, or until your dog is familiar with the approach. Then take the pet toothbrush, soak it in warm water and start brushing daily for several days. When your dog accepts this brushing, add the pet toothpaste. Most attention should be given to the outside of the upper teeth. The toothbrush bristles should be placed at the gum margin where the teeth and gums meet at a 45-degree angle. The movement should be in an oval pattern. Be sure to gently place the bristle ends into the area around the base of the tooth as well as into the space between the teeth. Complete ten short back and forth motions, then move the brush to a new location. Cover three to four teeth at a time. Dog home dental care should include daily brushing using an enzymatic pet toothpaste and a proper toothbrush.  Taking an active role in your dog's dental care will help reduce dental disease, bad breath, and potentially life-threatening heart and kidney disease.

Category: Conditioning Your Dog to Nail Trims
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Teaching your dog to be calm and comfortable with the nail trimming process is necessary for your pet’s well-being. Your dog needs to hold still as their feet and nails are manipulated. The procedure can be painful if the nails are trimmed too short or if your dog struggles during physical restraint. Untrimmed toenails can break or tear, causing pain or infection. Trimmed nails help to contribute to healthy body movement. Lay a Positive Foundation in Puppyhood Food treats distract puppies and help keep them still without restraint. Lickable treats such as squeezable cheese, canned food, or peanut butter spread on a spatula or table are helpful. Trim one or two nails daily so your puppy enjoys short training sessions. If they become stressed, stop and try again later with higher-value treats. Routine trimming is not an emergency and forcing your dog’s compliance may cause long-term resistance to foot and toe handling. Change the Emotion to Change the Behavior Classical conditioning can be used to change your dog’s emotional state from neutral or negative to positive by rewarding each step with a tasty treat. Ideally, your puppy will learn to expect a yummy treat at the sight of the trimmers. The process should proceed at your dog’s pace and they should remain relaxed. It may take several sessions to change their emotional response. Each nail trim step should occur right before the treat is delivered and the treat is given regardless of your dog’s reaction. They do not need to offer a paw or other behavior, to earn the treat. Rushing the training may cause your dog to become fearful, and then they may associate treats with a negative experience. They will then avoid the treats and nail trims. Observe your dog’s body language for subtle indications of stress or fear. When working with a partner during the conditioning process, one person can carry out each step while the other delivers the treat. Clear communication and proper timing are important. If your dog is given the treat too soon, they will not connect the handling to the treat. Your dog should be aware of each step, then rewarded before continuing. Operant conditioning gives your dog an opportunity to offer their cooperation. They can be taught to sit, lift a front paw, place the paw in your hand and hold it still. No restraint is necessary as the dog elects to participate. Positive reinforcement training methods should be used. If punishment methods such as pushing, grabbing, pinching, yelling, collar corrections, or shock are used, then fear and anxiety will be associated with nail trimming. Your veterinarian may suggest both classical and operant conditioning for home practice and clinic nail trim visits. A referral to a positive reinforcement trainer or board-certified veterinary behaviorist may be made. If your dog needs a nail trim before being fully trained, sedation can be used to prevent further stress. Daily supplements and medications may be prescribed to lessen a dog’s anxiety before nail trims. Nails should be kept short for your dog’s health and wellness. Classical and operant conditioning are techniques to ensure successful nail trims. With patience and low stress handling, nail trims can become routine for every dog.

Category: De-Skunking Your Dog or Cat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Skunk Funk  If your little punk Has been skunked Have no fear, Read here my dear A recipe you will need His funk to cede By Valerie Brons, BVetM  Getting sprayed by a skunk happens to curious dogs who stick their noses into places that annoy skunks. It happens to cats, too, just not nearly as often. Unless your pet has been skunked, you may not realize that the odor stuck to your pet is not the same minor one that you smell driving down a road where a skunk has released its scent. The up close and personal smell won’t just make you wrinkle your nose and gag a bit; it’s a bit like the acrid smell of burning rubber or chemical fire that grasps your lungs and hurts your eyes.  If people have this reaction from being next to their pet, imagine what pets, with their highly sensitive noses, feel. Unfortunately, it is up to you to remove the odor. While you can take them to veterinarian, getting sprayed often happens outside clinic hours. Emergency rooms see some of these cases, although that is a costlier approach than doing it yourself.  You can bathe them yourself with the formulacreated by a scientist in a laboratory. 1 quart 3% hydrogen peroxide 1/4 cup baking soda 1 teaspoon of liquid dish soap or hand soap Hand soap is milder and won't strip out the oily residue as well as dish soap, so dish soap is preferable, but use what you have available. It is unlikely that one shampoo with this recipe will be enough to eliminate that odor. Depending on the length of the pet’s coat, the volume of spray, and how long you are able to rub shampoo into the coat, you may need do it more than once, or even a few times. Mixing Typically, 3% hydrogen peroxide is sold in pint bottles, so two are needed for this recipe. Anything stronger than 3% is not recommended. If your bottle is expired, get fresh ones instead. The best place to mix the formula is in a clean plastic bucket with plastic utensils to stir. Metal is not a good choice because it encourages the peroxide to decompose. If needed to cover your whole dog, up to a quart of lukewarm water (not hot or cold water) can be added to the solution. Apply the solution immediately, anddo not store itin a bottle or spray bottle to avoid having the bottle explode. Bottles of hydrogen peroxide do not burst in the store because underneath the cap, on the cap liner, the manufacturer has left teeny holes through which the oxygen gas is released. How Does it Work? The nasty part of the skunk odor (is there any part that isn’t horrific?) is created by organic compounds called thiols, which are responsible for making other hideous odors such as decomposing flesh. The oxygen created by combining hydrogen peroxide and baking soda neutralizes the thiols. Bathing Skunks tend to aim for a dog’s face. Both the skunk spray and the solution you’ve made will sting (and possibly harm) a dog’s eyes, so keep the solution away from the eyes. As soon as you can, wash your dog in this solution and really work it into the fur, particularly on long coated breeds. Leave the solution on the dog for about 5 minutes. Some areas that reek more than others may need more baths. Wash the dog as many times as it takes for the dog to smell like a wet dog rather than a dog sprayed by a skunk. It is possible that for a few months afterward the dog will smell slightly of skunk when wet. Rinse the dog with lukewarm water. Rinse any leftover solution down the drain with added water. Safety Warnings (There are Several) DO NOT SMOKE while shampooing asthis mixture is flammable. Toss out what you haven’t used; it can’t be bottled. The chemical reaction of pressure from hydrogen peroxide and baking soda will make it burst, and the explosion can cause injuries.  The chemist who discovered it should have become filthy rich from it, but it can’t be bottled for long enough to package and sell it. It won’t even last an evening, so toss out what you haven’t used. If you intend to bathe your pet again tomorrow, make another batch then; it’s better to bathe them a few times the day it happens.  Remember that a similar eruption in paper mache volcanoes is caused by combining dishwashing soap. baking soda and vinegar. Hydrogen peroxide will lighten black hair to a bronze color, and that will not return to the usual darker shade on its own; note that hydrogen peroxide is an ingredient in permanent hair dye and some blonde hair dye. The fur will have to grow out. If you plan to show your black dog in conformation, consider some other option instead (see below). Not unexpectedly, the solution will bleach out towels and fabric, so while you bathe the dog, wear old clothes and towels you don’t mind getting bleached. Keep the solution out of your pet’s eyes. It can be irritating enough to cause shallow corneal ulcers. That may be difficult to prevent if the dog is sprayed directly in the face. Other Choices That old silliness about using tomato juice or sauce to get rid of the odor is likely based on the acidity of tomatoes. It simply does not work. Most veterinarians keep Thornell’s Skunk-Off at the clinic. Many over-the-counter products like this can be found at pet supply stores. It can also be used in the carpet, car seats, furniture, and so on. It does not contain hydrogen peroxide, so it can be used on black dogs. It is available in shampoos for pets and spray bottles for carpeting, bedding, clothing, upholstery, and so on. It can cause minor irritation. A water and vinegar douche can work. First wash the dog in liquid soap and rinse it out well. Then apply the douche (a spray bottle works well) and leave it there; don’t rinse it off. Usually, unmedicated varieties do not expire. For your house or car, keep the windows open, run air conditioning if you have it, and use whatever household product you have to eliminate odors indoors. The product may not help much, or at all, but it can’t hurt. A Health Risk from the Skunk Spray Dogs who get a full shot of skunk spray in the face can develop a form of damage to their red blood cells thatcauses anemia.  This result can make the dog weak and turn their mucous membranes (gums, inside cheeks) a chocolate color. If that happens, veterinary intervention is needed. The dog may need blood transfusions and supportive measures.  Severely skunked dogs should be monitored closely for 12 hours for such signs as lethargy, weakness, lack of appetite. Extremely severe cases of this resulting anemia can be fatal. Most dogs that get sprayed by a skunk do not get bitten because they retreat after being sprayed. But if a dog is bitten by the skunk, the owner should seek veterinary attention due torabiesrisk and for possible wound care. Some dogs are more likely to encounter skunks, depending on their geographic area and temperaments, and you may need to do this more than once. If that is the case, consider keeping unexpired supplies on hand.

Category: Hospice and Palliative Care for Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The goal of hospice care, sometimes referred to as palliative care or end-of-life care, is to improve comfort at the end of your pet's life. Some diseases are incurable or would involve uncomfortable or expensive treatments that your family may choose not to pursue. Even so, there are still simple steps you can take to make your pet comfortable and peaceful. With hospice care, you can help them enjoy life as much as possible until their time comes. How Do I Know if Hospice Care Is Right for My Pet? If your pet's condition has progressed to the point where curative treatment is no longer your first choice, you can talk to your veterinarian about hospice care. They can discuss the symptoms your pet has, what you can expect for your pet's health as time goes on, and options for care. It is best to bring everyone in your household who will be involved in caring for your pet to this discussion. There may also be house-call veterinarians focused on end-of-life care in your area who will have further information for you. You may have to search for these house-call veterinarians online if you want to pursue that type of care. At this consult, your veterinarian may ask you what your goals are for hospice care, what you want your pet's end of life to look like, and what your thoughts are about euthanasia. Consider your ability to give regular medications, modify your home, or spend more time with your pet during hospice care. Some conditions may also require advanced care at home, such as daily injections, and specialized diets possibly including tube feedings, skin dressings, and enemas. Some pet owners are unable to provide the level of care that hospice requires. If that is your situation, let your veterinarian know. Hospice is about finding what you feel is the most comfortable end of life you can offer your pet. How Could Hospice Care Make My Pet More Comfortable? Your veterinarian will discuss some options for pain management with you. They may prescribe pain medications or recommend additional treatments, such as acupuncture, massage, physical therapy, or temperature therapy (the use of heating or cooling devices to soothe pain). They may also offer medications for nausea and anxiety, two other common symptoms in dying patients. Hospice care may also involve regular laboratory tests to make changes as necessary for your pet's comfort. For example, regular blood tests in animals with kidney failure can help to identify changes in blood chemistry. You and your veterinarian can then decide what is best for your pet and their quality of life. What Is My Role as a Caregiver in Hospice Care? Your job is to spend as much quality time with your pet as you would like, give medications and treatments if necessary, and monitor their health at home. Some end-of-life veterinarians have team members who can help you give these treatments if necessary. You may also need to maintain your pet's hygiene with a damp cloth or wet wipes, especially if their mobility is limited or they are incontinent, as urine and stool can lead to skin irritation. Discussing any issues that come up with your veterinarian so you can address them quickly together is also part of your role. Pet owners often share with veterinarians how special it is to care for their pets during their final days of life. What Will I Need To Change in My Home? You may want to make some temporary changes to your home to ensure your pet's safety and comfort. How Can I Check My Pet’s Quality of Life at Home? Checking your pet's quality of life is a way of weighing the factors that improve their lives against those that make it more difficult. As your pet's owner and the person who knows them best, you are well equipped to perform quality of life assessments by observing them at home. Regularly ask yourself these questions: By keeping track of your responses, you can monitor any changes in your pet's wellbeing and work with your veterinarian to keep them comfortable for as long as possible There are a variety of other quality-of-life scoring systems and tools available online. You can use these tools to assess your pet’s quality of life, follow their progression, and think about what you want your pet’s end of life to look like. Each of these systems has its own benefits and drawbacks, and one might fit your situation better than another. Whichever scale you choose, use it consistently so that you can accurately track changes in your pet’s quality of life. https://veterinarypartner.vin.com/doc/?id=4951966&pid=19239 https://vetsocialwork.utk.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/EndoLifeValues-Goals.pdf https://vet.osu.edu/vmc/sites/default/files/import/assets/pdf/hospital/companionAnimals/HonoringtheBond/HowDoIKnowWhen.pdf Where Can I Go for Support? Your veterinarian and veterinary staff are available to help you understand the process of end-of-life care. If necessary, they can also refer you to other professionals who can help you, like pet sitters, groomers, veterinary technicians, or veterinarians who specialize in certain diseases. Consider reaching out to a bereavement or grief counselor, as many will hold pet loss groups or classes that you can attend for as long as you feel you want to go. You may also find it comforting to turn to spiritual leaders. Providing hospice care can be difficult, so remember to take care of yourself as well by seeking support from friends, family, and professionals when you need it. Be sure to get enough rest and make time for activities that bring you peace and joy. Your love and care will have a huge impact on your pet’s comfort at the end of their life.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When a dog starts having housetraining accidents, it’s easy to believe the dog is acting out of anger or some other defiant motive. That is rarely the case. Let’s look at reasons for housetraining accidents and methods for improving your dog’s batting average. Medical Causes Medical causes should always be ruled out first. Any medical condition that causes increased frequency, urgency, or volume in urine or stool can lead to house soiling. Having the dog evaluated by your veterinarian is a good idea. Your veterinarian may recommend specific testing such as fecal, urine, and blood tests based on your dog’s specific problems and the results of the physical exam. Behavioral Causes Once medical causes have been eliminated, consider these behavior causes. Getting to the root of the problem will ensure proper treatment and the best chance for successful resolution of the problem. Be a Detective—and a Friend You can see from this long list that a lot of things can throw off a dog’s housetraining habit. You need to determine what could be causing your dog’s problem. There could be multiple reasons. With your veterinarian’s help and possibly the help of a behavior specialist, you can make it better. Housetraining is a habit. The dog doesn’t understand why we want this, and yet dogs are so adaptable that most of them can be helped to develop the housetraining habit and to restore it when something has interfered. Even people have bathroom problems from time to time, so we shouldn’t be at all surprised that it happens with dogs. One way dogs help humans to live longer, healthier lives is by needing our care. This is a day-to-day reason to get out of bed and to think beyond our own problems. You could even say that housetraining is good for us!

Category: Low Stress Toothbrushing
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dental disease is painful and most pets over the age of three suffer from gum disease. Recommended by veterinarians, daily toothbrushing is one of the best ways to slow the progression of dental disease, lengthen the time between professional cleanings, and has many other benefits to your pet’s overall health. For some pets, a toothbrush is scary and, for many pet owners, hard to maneuver in the mouth making brushing a chore. Be aware that if your pet has dental disease, brushing with your finger may cause pain and use caution not to get bitten. How can we make brushing less of a chore and more fun for all? The answer: 3”x3” cotton gauze squares Gauze is more abrasive and effective than rubber finger brushes and less invasive than a brush with a handle. Gauze allows you to feel when you’re touching the teeth instead of the delicate gums. Check with your veterinarian and stop brushing immediately if your pet seems painful or bleeding occurs. Choosing the Toothpaste: When brushing teeth, it is important to choose a toothpaste specifically designed for pets and approved by theVOHC (Veterinary Oral Health Council). Avoid human toothpaste since some contain Xylitol which is toxic to pets. From the many flavors available, find one your pet likes best. If your pet is still resistant, start the training process with tuna juice or gravy to help create a strong positive association with brushing. Let’s start brushing! Step 1:Unfold the gauze square and wrap it around your index finger. Pinch the tail of the gauze with your thumb. Step 2:Dip your fingertip into the juice or gravy or place a pea-sized dot of pet toothpaste on your fingertip and allow your pet to lick your fingertip. Repeat three times. Your pet should quickly and eagerly approach and lick your finger before you move to the next step. Step 3:Repeat steps 1-3 and slide your finger under your pet’s upper lip and make a gentle brief brush action. Then allow them to lick the remaining toothpaste. Repeat three times. Your pet should approach and not back away from your finger. Avoid restraining your pet’s head or following them if they move their head away. Repeat until your pet is holding still and eagerly licking the toothpaste. Step 4:Repeat the above steps and place your finger farther towards the top back teeth. Gradually increase the gentle brushing swipes then allow your pet to lick the remaining toothpaste. You can place your hand under their chin to steady their head if necessary. Step 5:Repeat the above technique to brush the outside of the lower teeth on the same side. Step 6:Wrap a new piece of gauze around your finger to regain abrasiveness, apply more toothpaste and brush the top and bottom teeth on the other side of the mouth. Your pet’s mouth is now healthier! Remember: When you brush your pet’s teeth it’s okay if you aren’t perfect. It is more important for your pet to be comfortable and willing to accept frequent brushing. Strive for brushing every day. Set yourself up for success by placing your pet’s toothpaste where you will incorporate it into your daily routine. Spend a little bit of time teaching your pet to enjoy toothbrushing for positive results. Your pet’s health will improve, your veterinarian will be pleased you’re being proactive, and you can save money by decreasing the frequency and intensity of professional dental cleanings.

Category: Microchipping Could Save your Pet's Life
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A microchip ID is a small transmitter about the size of a grain of rice. When a scanner passes over it, a signal is emitted indicating the unique identification number of the chip. This tiny but sturdy little implant can reunite you with a lost pet, serve as proof of ownership in a dispute, or even mean the difference between euthanasia and medical care in an emergency. In many communities, it is not legal to own an unmicrochipped dog, and in many communities, shelters automatically microchip any pet that is released through its doors for adoption. Microchipping has been around for over 20 to 30 years, yet some pet owners still resist chipping. Questions commonly arise about how the chip is inserted, what information is contained on the chip, the difference between a registered chip and an unregistered one, what to do if a chipped pet is lost, and more. There are many misconceptions about chipping. For example: Don't forget to update your contact information with the chip registry when you move. What Information is Encoded on the Chip? Only the unique identification number is encoded on the chip. None of your personal information is on the chip. The chip number is similar to a Vehicle Identification Number on a car. It is registered in one of several central registries just as a car is registered and it is the central registry that has your personal information (name, address, phone number, alternate contact, pet description etc.). Each chip number is unique and no two chips have the same number. Let's clear up some confusion. Microchip Implantation: Basically a Shot With a Big Needle The microchip ID is small enough to pass through the bore of a large needle made for this purpose. Microchips are generally shipped in an individually packaged syringe made for chip implantation. Implantation is basically a shot, and if you like, it can be done in the examination room while you watch. The needle is fairly large, so sometimes there is a yipe but, more often than not, the reaction is minimal. Chips can be implanted in newborn animals to assist in telling them apart. Some people like to wait until the pet is being spayed or neutered so that the pet does not feel the large chip implantation needle. The downside of waiting, of course, is that pets may escape or get lost before they have their permanent ID. A common misconception is that chip implantation requires surgery. In fact, a chip can be implanted in a matter of seconds while you wait. Can a Microchip be Used to Locate a Lost Pet? No. A microchip is not a location device. At the present time, GPS collars are available, but their use is limited by the fact that a collar can be removed or can come off. A microchip is an identification device, not a locator. With All This Fancy Technology, Why Is an Old-Fashioned Identification Tag Included with the Chip? An ID tag is usually provided with the chip. The ID tag has the chip number and phone number for the registry. The tag is not for your keyring or to keep in a drawer; it is meant for your pet to wear as a backup. If a lost pet is found by a neighbor, stranger, or basically by anyone who does not have their own handy chip scanner, they will see the ID tag and know who to call. The registry will either contact you or they will provide the finder with information on how to contact you.  It is important to periodically check this tag over the years as the markings on the plastic tend to fade, and if they are illegible, they will not be helpful. You can order replacement tags from the chip company or have engraved metal tags made by any of a number of pet tag companies, but be sure to include the registry phone number on the tag if you do. What Happens If the Chip Does Not Get Registered? It is vitally important that you register your chip. Simply having a chip will not bring your pet home to you. Many rescue groups, pet stores, and shelters will implant chips and let you know your new pet is chipped, but leave the registration (which usually requires a fee) up to you. Many animal hospitals will chip your pet and then give you the mail-in registration form to complete the process at home.  Be very clear about this point when you get a new pet that comes with a chip. It is easy for the registration forms to get mixed up in receipts, vaccination records, and other paperwork. If a pet with an unregistered chip is found, it may still be possible to trace the owner. The manufacturer of the chip is usually identifiable from the chip number. The major microchip manufacturers keep records of the facilities to which they have sold their chips. In this way, the facility where the chip was implanted can be identified. If that facility has records, the owner may be identified and contacted. This process assumes the manufacturer keeps records (smaller companies do not), that the facility where the chip was implanted keeps records, and that the owner's phone number is the same. If there are no records, this all leads to a dead end. It is really important to keep your registration current. If your chip is not registered and someone finds your pet and wishes to keep him, they may simply register the chip in their own name. Often a chip is implanted, and the registration forms are given to you to fill out on your own.If you do not send in the forms, the chip will not be registered. Must the Chip’s Registration be Renewed Annually? For the major brands of microchips, the answer is no. Once the chip is registered, that registration is indefinite. This is a good thing in that the chip never becomes unregistered after it has been registered. The problem is that people move or the pet changes ownership and the chip information is never updated. Some chip registries have developed deluxe programs that do require annual renewal largely as a means to remind you to keep your information current. How Many Registries Are There? There are many chip registries, and a chip can be registered in any of them. The good news is that most chip distributors have their own registries, and it is easy to find a chip’s most likely registry based on its number. For example, AVID chips are generally in the AVID database, HomeAgain chips are generally in the HomeAgain database, etc. Because so many chip registries have emerged, it can get tricky to determine what registry to call when a found animal is located. The American Animal Hospital Association has developed PetMicrochipLookUp.org. This tool allows for a registered chip number to be connected to its registry. The registry can then be contacted for owner contact information. If the chip is not registered, then its manufacturer is identified, and it may be possible to trace the owner by tracing the chip to the facility where it was implanted, as described earlier. It is important to consider the importance of the chip's registry. It is vital that the registry be identifiable from the chip number, as this will be how your pet is returned to you. If the pet is chipped but it is not possible to tell what registry to contact, the chip is useless. If the chip company does not participate in PetMicrochipLookUp.org, it will be very hard to determine where to call. Further, you need the registry to be reachable 24 hours a day and you want a company that is stable enough that you can count on its being in business for the entire lifespan of your pet.  It is tempting to look for bargains in microchipping, but this seems to be an area where it is best to stick to major brands and use their associated registries. One would think there was one single registry for all chips, but there is not, and one would think customer service would be consistent among registries, but it is not. What Should Be Done for a Pet That Was Adopted With a Chip Registered to a Prior Owner? Each chip company has its own policy for this situation. Some will require a written note from the original owner allowing registration change. Some companies attempt to contact the original owner for a defined amount of time, and if the owner is not reached, then the chip may be re-registered. Contact the chip company that issued the chip for instructions in this situation. Is Licensing the Pet with the City Going to Register the Chip Automatically? Don't count on it. When a dog is adopted from a city shelter, it is common for the dog to be issued a license and for a microchip to be implanted and registered, but this depends on the city. The dog license registration will include information about the dog's rabies vaccination, ownership, and microchip number, if there is one, but that is not the same thing as registering the chip. If the pet is found and brought to the shelter, the chip will identify him in the shelter's records but if the pet is found and brought anywhere else, identifying the owner will depend on whether or not the chip is properly registered. What Should I Do If My Pet Is Lost? Notify the chip company so that the chip number will be flagged as belonging to a lost pet. If the company has a system beyond its chip registry, your pet's photo (assuming you have uploaded one) will be circulated to local animal hospitals and shelters. Be sure the chip company has your correct telephone number and contact information should your pet be found. Be sure to check the local animal shelter and inquire as to how to proceed there. Posters around the neighborhood also help. Hopefully, your pet is wearing some sort of identification as well (such as the tag that came with the chip) so that you can be contacted by the finder directly. What Do I Do if I Find a Pet? Running the pet to a local animal hospital or shelter will allow for rapid scanning for the presence of a microchip. If a chip is discovered and it is registered, it should not be difficult to find the owner. It is amazing how long some animals are lost before someone thinks to scan them. If you find a stray dog or cat, be sure to have it scanned sooner rather than later in case someone is out there searching. If there is no chip or identification tag, check the lost ads in the local newspaper listings. If there is no match-up, you may be legally compelled to bring the animal to the local animal shelter as this will be where the original owner is likely to look. Situations Where a Chip Can Mean Life or Death Lost Pet This is the obvious situation for which the chip ID was developed. If your lost pet is recovered by the local shelter or taken to an animal hospital as a lost pet, the pet is scanned, the number found, the registry contacted, and you will be notified. Burglary If your home is burglarized, you can bet the criminals involved will not be careful to leave your doors or gates closed when they leave. Your pet may wander away in this situation, and permanent identification may be needed to help your pet get home. Natural Disaster Earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides, hurricanes, etc. all lead to pets being separated from their homes. In some cases, Animal Control must evacuate pets from a community into a central holding area. Being able to prove a pet is yours is invaluable in this situation, especially if your pet is difficult to identify from a photo or does not have distinguishing markings. After Hurricane Katrina, a number of rescued animals were evacuated to holding areas, and their photos were posted on the Internet. Many pets were frightened, and good photographs could not be obtained. Injury If a pet is injured while lost or injured while roaming - as in the case of an outdoor cat hit by a car - a good Samaritan might bring the pet to an animal hospital for care. A stranger may not be willing to cover expenses for a pet they found on the road, and if your pet has no identification, you may never even know what happened. A microchip allows you to be notified so that proper decisions can be made. Don't forget to chip a pet before traveling with you. A traveling pet is unfamiliar with the area you are visiting and may be more likely to get lost The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Nail Boards: An Alternative to Clipping Nails
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many dogs do not like having their nails trimmed and some are outright petrified. Dogs can be taught to file their own nails using a nail board. Dogs learn to scratch on the board using a scratching or digging motion. Nail boards can be purchased or hand made using a board, duct tape, and coarse or medium sandpaper. Learning to use the Nail Board Dogs learn quickly how to use a nail board with minimal training. You shape the behavior by breaking down the completed behavior of scratching the board into smaller steps, rewarding your dog for completing each step. These steps include approaching the board, touching it with any body part, touching with a paw, touching with multiple paws, moving the paw while touching the board, and finally scratching the board with each paw. When rewarding your dog, treats can be rolled down the board. Minimal Training Required Another alternative to nail board training is to incorporate fun games.

Category: Neutering Your Male Dog
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Why Should I Neuter my Dog? Aside from helping control the current overpopulation of dogs, neutering a pet dog generally makes for a healthier dog and better pet. Neutered dogs tend to live longer and have fewer behavior problems (see below). They are less likely to be relinquished to the shelter and do not contribute to overcrowding in community animal shelters with their offspring. The local government is more interested in having fewer roaming dogs that could be dangerous and having less burden on the animal services budget. Pet owners are more interested in having a well-behaved and long-lived family pet. What Are the Health Benefits to the Dog? There are several health benefits to neutering. One of the most important concerns is the prostate gland, which under the influence of testosterone will gradually enlarge over the course of the dog’s life. By age five years, it is usually significantly enlarged in an unneutered male dog. As the dog continues to age, his prostate is likely to become uncomfortable, possibly being large enough to interfere with defecation. The prostate under the influence of testosterone is also predisposed to infection, which is almost impossible to clear up without neutering. Neutering causes the prostate to shrink into insignificance, thus preventing both prostatitis as well as the uncomfortable benign hyperplasia (enlargement) that occurs with aging. It is often erroneously held that neutering prevents prostate cancer but this is not true; the benefits of neutering on the prostate are about preventing enlargement and infection. Other health benefits of neutering include the prevention of certain types of hernias and tumors of the testicles and anus. Excessive preputial discharge is also reduced by neutering. What Behavioral Changes Can be Expected After Neutering? Numerous studies on the effects of neutering have been performed evaluating playfulness, fear of strangers, territorial aggression, mounting, urine-marking, roaming, and other behaviors. The behaviors that are most consistently altered after neutering are inappropriate mounting, urine marking, and fighting. These behaviors were significantly reduced or completely eliminated in 50-60 percent of male dogs after neutering. Most pet owners look forward to curtailing these actions and thereby improving their relationship with their dog. What Exactly is Done Surgically? An incision is made, generally just forward from the scrotum. The testicles are removed through this incision. The stalks are tied off and cut. Castration is achieved. If the testicles are not removed, the desirable benefits listed above cannot be realized. The skin incision may or may not have stitches. What Can I Expect Upon Discharge From the Hospital? The scrotum is often swollen in the first few days after surgery, leading some people to wonder if the procedure was really performed. If the dog is immature at the time of neutering, the empty scrotum will flatten out as he grows. If he is mature at the time of neuter, the empty scrotum will remain as a flap of skin. Sometimes the incision is mildly bruised. Most male dogs are eager to play by the day after surgery but, to keep the incision intact, it is best to restrict the dog from boisterous activity. At What Age Can Neutering Be Performed? Male dogs can be neutered at just about any age, although the traditional age is still before puberty at six to nine months old. There is some controversy regarding when the best age for neutering should be: after puberty, traditional age, or "early" which can mean any age from eight weeks up to six months.  Shelters have had problems with adopters of young puppies failing to return for neutering at the traditional age; a common solution is to neuter prior to adoption to preclude the pup's ability to contribute to pet overpopulation when he is older. It turns out there may be negative ramifications to this depending on the dog's breed. Long bones continue to grow for a longer period of time in dogs neutered before puberty, making for a taller adult dog. There can be joint problems associated with this, especially in larger breeds. Not all breeds, even large breeds, seem to have negative consequences when it comes to neutering before the age of one year so it is best to consult your regular veterinarian with regards to when to neuter your individual male dog. Senior dogs can also benefit from neutering. A diseased, enlarged prostate will still shrink down to a comfortable size even in an older dog. The neuter is a relatively simple low-risk surgery, which means that even an older dog can still benefit. For more information,this study from UC Davishas provided clarification on the best neutering ages for 35 common dog breeds. Will He Become Over-Weight or Lethargic? Metabolism changes with neutering in such a way that there is a moderate risk of becoming overweight after neutering. The dog owner should be prepared to make adjustments in diet or exercise if the dog seems to be gaining too much weight. Will He Still be Interested in Females? His interest will be reduced but if he is around a female dog in heat, he will become aroused by her. Mounting behavior often has roots in the expression of dominance and may be expressed by a neutered male in a variety of circumstances that are not motivated by sexuality. What if a Dog Has an Undescended Testicle? Undescended testicles have an increased tendency to grow tumors. They may also twist on their stalks and cause life-threatening inflammation. For these reasons, neutering is recommended for dogs with undescended testicles. This procedure is more complicated than a routine neuter; the missing testicle can be under the skin along the path upon which it should have descended to the scrotum, or it may be even inside the abdomen. Some exploration may be needed to find it; thus there is often an incision for each testicle. The retained testicle is sterile and underdeveloped. If there is one descended testicle, the dog will be able to breed but since retaining a testicle is a hereditary trait, it is important that the male dog not be bred before he is neutered. It is not a good idea to pass on the retained testicle trait. What are the Negative Aspects of Neutering? This turns out to be a more complicated subject to study than one might think. The issues that are typically studied are orthopedic/joint-related problems and different types of cancers and whether neutering a male dog truly changes the incidences of these. The Hoffman study of 2013 looked at over 70,000 canine medical records and found that neutering increases a dog's lifespan by 14 percent. They found that neutered dogs were less likely to die of infectious diseases, degenerative diseases, or trauma but were more likely to die of cancer or immune-mediated disease than their unneutered cohorts. Upon scrutinizing different cancers, incidences are still low. For example, the risk of developing prostate cancer is several times higher in neutered dogs vs. unneutered dogs but still less than one percent in both groups. Cancer development is more about environmental exposures and heredity/breed predispositions than about testosterone, so it has been difficult to draw conclusions. With regard to hip dysplasia and cruciate ligament rupture, probably the most common joint problems of dogs, body condition/obesity, the general size of the dog, and genetics are likely to be the major risk factors but there does seem to be an increased risk of these issues in dogs neutered before puberty when their bones are still growing and conformation is not set. Is Neutering Legally Required? In some areas, neutering may be required as municipalities attempt to prevent pet overpopulation. Check with your local city or county officials.

Category: Oral Joint Health Supplements #2
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English On the last program of Texas Vet News I talked about the large number of oral joint health supplements that are on the market for horses.  Even though these products are widely used, many of them are of questionable quality because there are no regulations governing them.  Because of this problem, Dr. Stacey Oke has developed a system for horse owners to help them choose a product that may be of better quality than some others.  First of all, choose a product from a company that has been in the animal health pharmaceutical business for years instead of months.  It is likely that companies with a good reputation are not going to stake their reputation on manufacturing a poor quality product for short-term sales.  Also, look for products that are backed by clinical research published in peer-reviewed veterinary journals.  Many companies report they have clinical trials but don’t have information available; even if they do have information, clinical trials that are not published in peer-reviewed journals are worthless. It is also important to look at the label and make sure all of the ingredients in the product are listed, including active, inactive, and filler ingredients.  Manufacturers that do not list all ingredients of their products likely use fillers and may not contain the labelled ingredients.  Products that make claims that seem too good to be true are probably not as good as they claim.  Dosing instructions should be accurate and clear, and the amount of ingredient per scoop should be printed clearly on the label.  Also, look for products with clear contact information and check to see if the company you choose has veterinarians on staff to answer your questions.

Category: Prophylactic Gastropexy in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  Commonly referred to asvolvulus,bloat, gastric dilatation, or gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV), is an often fatal emergency that causes the dog’s stomach to distend and twist. Two main risk factors for GDV areanxiety anda dog's body shape. GDV can happen to any breed of dog but tends to occur in deep, barrel-chested dogs such as Great Danes, St. Bernards, greyhounds, German Shepherds, Weimaraners, boxers, etc. Great Danes have the highest lifetime risk at about 40%. When gas and food distend (stretch) the dog’s stomach to several times its normal size, the dilated (distended) stomach usually rotates. We don’t know why it twists, but it can rotate anywhere from 90° to 360° degrees (essentially from one-quarter of a circle to all the way around). When it is twisted shut, it is like a balloon tied off with a knot: unless the balloon pops, nothing is getting out. Whatever is in the stomach(food, water, gas)cannot move into the intestines. The distended stomach crushes major blood vessels in the abdomen. Without treatment, a dog with GDV will experience significant pain and diewithin hours(it’s not the same time frame for every dog). For those owners who choose not to go with surgery to correct the GDV, the decision to euthanize must be made quickly because of the pain the dog is experiencing.   Gastric dilatation and volvulus(GDV)is an emergency that requires surgery and hospitalization or euthanasia. What is Prophylactic Gastropexy? An elective surgical procedure called prophylactic (or preventative) gastropexy (tacking) prevents GDV. In deep-chested dogs or those whose adult weight is expected to reach over 99 pounds (45 kg) this preventive surgery that permanently attaches (tacks) their stomachs to the body wall is often done when a dog is being spayed or neutered, or another surgery is taking place where the abdomen is being explored already. Gastropexy can be done when the dog is six months or older. It also can be an elective procedure on its own, or it can be done as part of treatment at the emergency room during an episode of GDV. Types of Prophylactic Gastropexy Prophylactic gastropexy is performed by a veterinary surgeon. Two incisions are made in the body wall, where the stomach is to be tacked, at the same spot from both the outside and inside. Sutures attach the stomach to the body wall at this spot. The scar tissue created from the two incisions will hold the stomach in place. Laparoscopic and endoscopic gastropexies are also possible and tend to heal faster than the method described above, but they require specialized equipment that may be available only at specialty hospitals. Laparoscopic gastropexy involves inserting instruments and a camera through two small incisions in the body wall. The endoscopic approach inserts the instruments and a camera through the mouth and esophagus into the stomach and needs only one incision. The laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures are less invasive and take less time to heal (around two weeks), so they are often used on working dogs such as police or military dogs that need to be back in action as quickly as possible. These procedures also shorten the time the dog is under anesthesia.  What Happens After Gastropexy Surgery? Excess gas can still be a problem, but tacking significantly reduces the stomach’s ability to twist. If the stomach becomes distended, it’s unpleasant and painful but not fatal. Unfortunately, the preventive procedure is not a complete guarantee that the dog will never have a twisted stomach, but with gastropexy surgery, the possibility of twisting drops to approximately 6%.   Elective vs. Emergency Prophylactic Gastropexy - Aftercare and Outlook Aftercare for preventive surgery is relatively simple. Post-operative care is essentially the same as an ovariohysterectomy (spay), and instructions will be to keep the dog calm and leashed for seven days. Do not let the dog jump or run, and keep the incision dry. A prophylactic gastropexy can be done in dogs whose owners plan on doing competitive agility. Some agility handlers have worried that the strenuous activity of agility will break down the tacking, but there have been no studies or patient case reports that indicate that. Activity or breeding will not make the tacked stomach any less effective. Surgery in an emergency setting requires more aftercare but depends on the dog’s case. Most patients will stay in the hospital for a few days. Their diet might need to be changed along with the usual post-operative care. In dogs with GDV, gastropexy reduces recurrence to less than 5%, while not doing one results in recurrence rates as high as 80%. A risk vs. benefit study calculated the lifetime risk of bloat and its medical treatment. The study found preventive surgery made sense for at-risk breeds, especially Great Danes. If your dog is not a predisposed breed or mixed breed and does not have other risk factors for GDV, you can discuss with your veterinarian if a prophylactic gastropexy is advised/necessary. If you do have a large breed dog and/or other risk factors and have concerns about bloat, talk with your veterinarian about the potential benefits and risks of gastropexy to see if it is a good option for your dog.

Translating Return to English Famous for its wrinkles, the ChineseShar-Peihas gone from the rarest dog breed listed by the Guinness Book of World Records to its current status of popularity. This breed is famous for its aloof temperament and its medical issues; still, most Shar-Pei owners would not trade their breed for any less controversial one. The following discussion is meant to assist people who are considering the adoption of aShar-Pei. TheShar-Peiis a unique animal with unique needs and may not be suited for the first-time dog owner or for a family that requires a low-maintenance dog. The Shar-Pei is not a breed to adopt lightly; you must be prepared for an extra time commitment and even extra veterinary expenses. Temperament TheShar-Peiis famous for the possessiveness of its family but is not always socially accepting of strangers. Proper socialization at an early age is crucial, and individuals should be purchased from breeders who have bred for temperament if possible. What does this all mean? It means that this is a breed that tends to be aggressive towards strangers if not trained otherwise. This is not a breed that is naturally friendly or solicitous to unfamiliar people. The Shar-Pei is classically reactive to undesired manipulation, whereas another breed might be highly tolerant naturally. This can create a problem when people visit or if the dog is to be around small children (especially children the dog does not know). If you will be adopting a puppy, will you have time to socialize the puppy properly? If you are considering an adult dog, it is important to obtain information about the dog’s temperament. Have there been problem situations? Of course, manyShar-Peiindividuals are tractable and affectionate, but it is important to know this breed's natural tendencies. If you already know you will not have time to spend on socialization and conditioning, you may want a breed that requires less attention. Coat Quality and Wrinkles There are two types of coat textures recognized by the American Kennel Club for theShar-Pei: "horse" and "brush." The horse coat is very short, and many people are sensitive to its texture, developing itchy rashes within minutes of contact. In fact, the name "shar pei" actually means "sand skin" in Cantonese because of this phenomenon. Obviously, if you or a family member has this reaction, the horse-coated individual is not for you. The brush coat is a bit longer and smoother. There is a third coat, “bear,” which is longer, softer, and tends to have less trouble with skin infections. Unfortunately, the AKC considers coats longer than one inch (at the shoulder) to be a disqualification in the show ring. Skin wrinkles are the hallmark of this breed. Since this was originally a breed used in fighting and guarding, the excess skin allows the dog to effectively turn around in its own skin if it is grasped or bitten by another dog. Wrinkles are possible to this extent because a mutation creates excessive mucin in the skin tissues. It is this mutation that leads to an assortment of inflammatory problems, as will be described in succeeding sections. In selecting an individual for health reasons, it is best to choose a dog with limited wrinkles if possible. Eyelid Problems: Entropion The excessive facial wrinkles that make this dog what it is can create excessive tissue around the eyelids. When the eyelids, especially the lower lids, are very puffy, the hairy skin will actually rub on the eyes. The pain leads to squinting, which compounds the problem. The eye can be ulcerated, and the cornea can pigment, leading to permanent blindness. Excessive moisture or watering around the eyes is a sign that a problem exists. This condition is calledentropionand is very common in the Shar-Pei. If the animal in question is a puppy, eyelid tacking can help tremendously by pulling the lid into a more normal position, resolving the pain and eye damage. As the puppy grows, the eye-opening enlarges, and the problem may greatly improve naturally. Many dogs will need one or more eyelid revisions in adulthood. Entropion is a painful condition and should not be ignored or considered part of the breed. Skin Fold Infection The enclosed spaces between the Shar-Pei's wrinkles form excellent incubators for Staphylococciand other bacteria. Skin fold infections may result. In this condition, which usually involves the folds around the muzzle, the skin becomes red and moist and soon begins to smell. Regular grooming is vital to this breed, as is inspection and cleaning of the skin folds. Brushing stimulates the production of important protective skin oils. Choosing a less wrinkled individual may be helpful in avoiding this problem. Special products may be needed to clean the skin folds on certain individual dogs. See your veterinarian if you think your dog needs assistance with this situation. Demodectic Mange TheDemodexmite lives inside the hair follicles of all normal dogs. In some unfortunate individuals, especially short-coated breeds such as the Shar-Pei, these mites proliferate and cause extensive skin inflammation. If your Shar-Pei develops any kind of skin disease, your veterinarian will probably include a skin scraping for mites in the testing performed. Due to the unique nature of Shar-Pei skin, often skin scrapes are not adequate for diagnosis and a skin biopsy is needed to detect the mites (especially true with a skin disease on the feet and between the toes). Hypothyroidism Current estimates suggest that one Shar-Pei in five is deficient in thyroid hormone. The thyroid hormone is important as it controls the metabolic rate for every cell in the body. Without thyroid hormone, everything just slows down, and the effects on the skin become most obvious. Hair loss with dandruff and pigmentation is common, and often, there is a "water line" pattern, a clear line of demarcation along the body below which the skin is irritated and above which the skin is normal. In general, this condition is not itchy but as the immune system is also slowed down, secondary infections that are itchy may result. If your Shar-Pei develops skin disease of any kind, your veterinarian will probably want to check thyroid levels to make surehypothyroidismis not involved. Infection Between the Toes (Pododermatitis) and Short-Coated Dog Pyoderma (Skin Infection) The short hairs of theShar-Pei(as with other short-coated dogs) may impact inside hair follicles leading to follicle rupture andskin infections. This situation may or may not be confined to the feet. The short, bristly fur of the Shar Pei with or without ingrown hairs may be responsible for this common syndrome. There are many possible causes of infection of the feet, including allergy, stress, demodectic mange, and more. If yourShar-Peihas itchy feet, it is likely that some sort of testing will be needed to sort out the possible causes. Ear Infections The Shar-Pei's ear canal is often too narrow for the veterinarian to examine. This sets up a perfect incubator for all sorts of microbes and makes treatment almost impossible. Ear surgery may be required to control the infections. It may be helpful to attempt to preventear infectionswith the weekly use of a good ear disinfectant. Ask your veterinarian about the best products. Familial Shar-Pei Fever(Also Called Swollen Hock Syndrome) This genetic disease causes episodes of fever up to 107⁰F, lasting one to two days. Joint swelling, especially the ankles (hocks), commonly accompanies the fever. If that were not bad enough, the condition is associated with a malignant protein deposition (amyloidosis) in the kidneys that commonly leads to kidney failure. Typically the fevers begin in puppyhood or adolescence though many dogs do not fit this age pattern precisely. AllShar-Peiindividuals should be regularly screened for protein loss in their urine though the condition is more likely to occur in dogs with more pronounced wrinkles. The disease is similar to a human condition called familial Mediterranean fever. Currently, Cornell University offers a blood test to identify Shar-Pei carrying the gene for this disease to determine an individual's risk of developing this disease. Treatment is available, but hopefully early identification of carriers will eliminate this disease from the breed. Owning a Shar-Pei requires genuine commitment as this breed has special needs. As an owner, you must be prepared for frequent visits to the veterinarian, plus daily grooming and observation. If you have any questions regarding your Shar-pei, do not hesitate to discuss them with your veterinarian.

Category: Spaying Your Female Dog
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  Surgical sterilization of the female dog, commonly referred to as spaying, is one of the most significant aspects of care an owner can provide for their female dog. The benefits to the dog far outweigh simply not having puppies, though as pet overpopulation looms as a societal problem, it is important to consider the bigger picture as well and be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. Spaying involves the removal of the uterus and ovaries. It is a major surgery but a very commonly performed one, most safely performed while a female dog is still in puppyhood, prior to her first heat cycle. All the Reasons you Should Spay your Female Dog Mammary Cancer Prevention A female dog spayed before her first heat will have a near-zero chance of developing mammary cancer. After the first heat, the incidence of tumor development climbs to 7% and after the second heat, the risk is 25% (one in four!). It is easy to see that an early spay can completely prevent what is frequently a difficult and potentially fatal form of cancer. But is it too late if a dog is already past her second heat? No, in fact, spaying is important even in female dogs who already have obvious tumors. This is because many mammary tumors are stimulated by estrogens; removing the ovaries, the source of estrogens will help retard tumor spread. Spaying removes the uterus and both ovaries and is crucial in preventing as well as treating mammary cancer. Pyometra Prevention Pyometrais a life-threatening infection of the uterus that generally occurs in middle-aged to older female dogs in the six weeks following heat. The hormone progesterone, which primes the uterus for potential pregnancy, does so by causing the proliferation of the blood-filled uterine lining and suppressing uterine immune function. In heat, it is thus easy for bacteria in the vagina to ascend to the uterus to cause infection. The uterus with pyometra swells dramatically and is filled with pus, bacteria, dying tissue, and toxins. Without treatment, the dog is expected to die. Despite her serious medical state, emergency spay is the usual recommendation if her life is to be saved. Older, unspayed female dogs have an irregular heat cycle. There is no end of cycling comparable to human menopause. If you still decide against spaying, be familiar with the signs of pyometra, which include loss of appetite, lethargy, vomiting, excessive thirst, and usually (but not always) obvious vaginal discharge. Simple Convenience Female dogs come into heat every eight months or so. There is a bloody vaginal discharge and local male dogs are attracted. Often there is an offensive odor. All of this disappears with spaying, not to mention the inconvenience of an unplanned litter of puppies to house, clean, feed, and adopt out. It’sNotJustaGoodIdea;inSomePlaces,It’stheLaw For instance, the spaying of female dogs has been mandatory in the city of Los Angeles since 2008, which means it is not legal to own an unspayed female dog in that city. Exceptions include law enforcement dogs, dogs currently in competition training, service dogs, and dogs with a medical exemption. Fines begin at $100. The city came to this resolution largely because of the huge expenses associated with its overcrowded shelter system and its euthanasia rate of approximately 4,000 unwanted dogs and cats per month. This problem comes down to one of population control; education has been inadequate to solve the problem as has simply charging $100 vs $10 to license unsterilized dogs. Spaying provides irreplaceable health benefits to the pet, convenience to the pet owner, benefit to the community, and it is now legally required. Check the laws in your area, or ask your veterinarian. Now That We Know Why it is a Good Idea to Spay, What Exactly Happens? It is important that the patient has not been fed for at least eight hours prior to surgery. Anesthetic medications commonly induce nausea and vomiting can be dangerous in a sedated patient (vomit can be inhaled/aspirated leading to pneumonia). A preoperative evaluation is performed; blood work is recommended for older females and may be recommended as a normal pre-anesthetic consideration. An intravenous catheter may be placed to facilitate the administration of anesthetic drugs, for any fluid administration, and for use in case of emergency. This necessitates shaving a small patch of skin on one of the legs. A tranquilizer or other pre-anesthetic medication may be administered to ease the induction of anesthesia. A medication is given intravenously to induce sleep. This medication is called an induction agent and lasts only long enough to establish the maintenance of anesthesia by the inhalant anesthetic (gas). Once the dog is asleep, a tube is placed in her throat to ensure that a clear airway is maintained throughout the procedure. Sometimes a cough is noted for a couple of days after surgery. This may have been caused by the tube in the throat. Such coughs only last a couple of days; anything that persists longer should be re-evaluated. The tube is hooked up to a machine that delivers a specific concentration of inhalant gas mixed with 100% oxygen. A technician is assigned to monitor this pet so that the concentration of inhalant gas can be changed as needed and the patient's mucous membrane color, heart rate, respiration, and other parameters are followed. In the surgical prep area, the abdomen is shaved and scrubbed. The bladder is emptied and the patient is moved to a surgical suite, where she is draped with surgical cloths or papers to isolate the area where the surgery will take place. An incision is made on the midline of the abdomen, and the three points where the ovaries and uterus attaches are tied off and cut. The abdomen is checked for bleeding and two or three layers of stitches are placed to close the incision. It is helpful to know that should the skin stitches come out, there are two layers below holding everything closed. Sometimes skin stitches are not placed but if they are present, you will need to return in 10-14 days to have them removed. Sometimes the skin layer is omitted in which case returning will be unnecessary unless there is a problem. The anesthesia technician continues monitoring until the dog wakes up and coughs out the throat tube. The patient is kept in an observation room until she is able to walk. Some veterinarians feel strongly that a night in the hospital is important to an uneventful recovery. This night in the hospital is similar to strict bed rest, just what you would expect to be needed after a major abdominal surgery. This night also allows for the proper administration of pain medication for a longer time period as well as a post-operative check-up with the doctor the morning after surgery.  As with all things medical, other veterinarians may have a different opinion and your veterinarian may send your dog home at the end of the day as long as they are deemed stable. What to Expect at Home Most spay surgery patients go home the same day or the next as if nothing had happened though pain medication will be provided to cover the next few days. Some nausea may occur in the first couple of days after surgery and it would not be unusual for the pet to refuse food for a day after surgery. As noted above, a cough may persist for a couple of days as a result of the throat tube. This should not persist for longer than a couple of days. Dogs who show a propensity to lick their stitches will need anElizabethan or "E" collarto restrict access to the stitches. This is not comfortable for the dog but it must be used strictly until the stitches are out and the incision is healed. Activity should be restricted during the week following surgery. Excessive activity can lead to swelling or fluid accumulation under the incision or even worse, a tear in the internal incision line. If a fluid pocket forms, it should resolve on its own after a few weeks. If something has torn inside, obviously the situation is more serious so it is wise to have any incision swelling inspected at the veterinarian's office. Fluid drainage from the incision would also be a reason for a recheck. What About Behavioral Changes? The female dog's reproductive tract is dormant for most of the year. It only activates for the three-week period of heat. This means that from a behavioral standpoint, the female dog acts spayed most of the time. This said, there has been a documented slowing of metabolism after spays and it may be necessary to use a reduced-calorie food in an adult dog. Check with your veterinarian about nutritional recommendations. What Age to Spay? A lot of factors go into this question. As mentioned, dogs have a huge problem with mammary cancer development, and spaying before the first heat cycle (generally before the ages of six to eight months) removes this problem as a consideration. Spaying before the first heat is protective against an extremely common form of cancer and there is no question about it. Further, spaying while the dog is of a smaller size makes for less trouble with bleeding in surgery and an easier recovery after surgery. Larger dogs are a more difficult surgery and are generally more costly to spay. That said, research has shown that there is an increased incidence of some other problems in some breeds when they are spayed young. For some breeds, there is an increased incidence of urinary incontinence associated with spaying before the age of one year. For larger breeds, the situation becomes more complicated. The problem for large-breed female dogs is that some breeds have a higher incidence of joint and bone issues or increased incidence (albeit small increases) in other types of cancers when they are spayed young. Issues regarding joint and bone problems, urinary incontinence, and cancers other than mammary cancer are highly dependent on breed such that findings for one breed do not hold true for another.

Category: Sunscreen for Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Sunscreen, or sunblock, can be used on cats and dogs. Pets with light skin and a short or thin hair coat are particularly prone to sunburn, skin cancer, and other solar-induced skin diseases (solar dermatitis, actinic keratosis, actinic dermatitis). If your dog’s coat is shaved during the summer for cooling, sunscreen may also be helpful. Additionally, pets who have suffered hair loss from allergies, surgery, or cancer radiation can benefit from sunscreen. In pets, sunburn can appear as red skin or hair loss. The most common sites for sunburn in cats and dogs are the bridge of the nose, ear tips, the skin surrounding the lips, and any other area where skin pigmentation is low. The skin on the groin, inside legs, and abdomen can also need sunscreen because hair is very thin there and UV light can reflect off of concrete surfaces to affect those areas of skin.  Also, dogs who like to expose their belly to the sun may need sunscreen. The best way to minimize UV exposure in pets is to avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. by keeping the pet inside. If that is not possible, sunscreen can be applied to protect the skin. Select a sunscreen that is fragrance-free, non-staining, and contains UVA and UVB barriers similar to SPF 15 or SPF 30 for humans. Some sunscreen products have been specifically created for pets. If you intend to use sunscreen on a cat, make certain that the product labeling specifically states that it is appropriate and safe for cats. Although some baby sunscreens may be safe for pets,avoid human sunscreens that have ingestion warningsbecause these products contain ingredients that can be toxic if licked by a dog or cat.No matter what sunscreen product you choose, remember to apply liberally and then re-apply regularly during sun exposure. Additionally, there are UV protective clothing or sunsuits for pets. These products may be helpful for protecting dogs who enjoy sunbathing on their backs and exposing the skin on their abdomen to the sun.

Category: Vaccine Titers for Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Your pet receives vaccines on a set schedule to protect them from illness. Vaccines tell the body to make immune cells and antibodies, which work to prevent or reduce the severity of specific diseases. Avaccine titeris a measure of disease-specific antibody levels in the blood. A higher titer means higher antibody levels and potentially greater protection for the animal. Although vaccine titers have historically been expensive, their use is increasing as they become more affordable and easier to measure. Veterinarians sometimes use vaccine titers to decide whether to revaccinate a pet at the scheduled time. The basic idea is that if your pet has enough antibodies to protect them against a disease, revaccination against that disease may not be necessary. It is important to note that thisonlyapplies to the following vaccines: The first three are core vaccines for dogs, while FPV is a core vaccine for cats. Core vaccines are recommended for all pets because the diseases they protect against are widely distributed and can cause significant illness and death. Although titers can be used to make decisions about these core vaccines, it is important to note that titers donotmatter for the rabies vaccine, another core vaccine. Legally, the rabies vaccine must be given at certain time intervals, regardless of how high the rabies antibody titer may be in your pet. Why can't titers be used for all vaccines? The body makes antibodies in response to both vaccination and infection. Therefore, if your pet has high antibody levels against a disease, this can tell us one of three things: For some diseases, high antibody levels do not mean your pet is protected. Therefore, your pet should be revaccinated as scheduled against these diseases, regardless of titer results. For a few diseases, however, high antibody levels do seem to predict protection from illness. These diseases arecanine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, canine parvovirusandfeline panleukopenia virus (FPV). Thus, a high titer for these diseases likely means your pet is protected enough to not need revaccination at that time. Meanwhile, a low titer might suggest the need for revaccination against these diseases, as your pet may not have enough protection. When should vaccine titers be used? Vaccine titers may be useful in a few scenarios. Remember, these scenarios applyonlyto vaccines against canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, canine parvovirus and FPV. Does a low vaccine titer mean my pet is not protected from disease? Not necessarily. Vaccines tell the body to make both antibodies and immune cells. The antibody levels decline faster than the levels of immune cells do. So, even if your pet has very few antibodies, they might have enough immune cells to defend them against disease. Unfortunately, it is hard to measure these immune cells, so a low titer may suggest the need for revaccination. Ultimately, this decision should be up to your veterinarian. It is worth noting, however, that the above does not apply to puppies and kittens. If your puppy or kitten has low antibody levels after completing their initial series of vaccines up to at least 16 weeks of age, they are not protected and thus they should be revaccinated. How often should vaccine titers be measured? That decision should be left to the individual veterinarian and the pet owner. What are the cons of doing vaccine titers? If you're interested in vaccine titers, you should consult your veterinarian about whether they would be a useful option for your pet. They can be a valuable tool in determining whether revaccination is necessary, but they may not be suitable for every animal.

Category: What First Time Puppy Owners Should Know
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The best age to bring a puppy home is at 8-10 weeks. That's the best possible timeframe, although bringing one home later than that hardly means your dog won't have any social skills; it just means that everything in the puppy's mind and body at 8-10 weeks is at a prime time for bonding and learning. The primary socialization period for puppies is between the 3rd and 12th week. An increase in social play is seen around 7-8 weeks, with hypersensitivity to unknowns happening between 6 and 8 weeks of age. Puppies should be introduced to most of the situations they will encounter as adults before the end of weeks 3-14. Housetraining and House Rules One of the first things your puppy must learn is housetraining. Some puppies will have been trained by the breeder, some will not; it depends on the breed and breeder. Their bladders are tiny. You need to take the puppy outside to the area where you expect dogs to do their business the moment the puppy wakes up in the morning and after every nap, after every meal, after indoor playtime, and last thing at night. The more often you go outside and praise the puppy for going there, the faster your housetraining is more likely to occur. Do not punish a puppy in any way for an indoors accident; it just teaches a puppy not to eliminate in front of you. It’s a learning curve, just as it is for human babies. It may take longer than you think is necessary or possible, but it will happen with enough effort on your part. For the rest of the dog’s life, your time will be ruled by their bladder, but especially now. Just as puppies must learn housetraining, they also need to learn your household rules. If you do not want your adult dog on the furniture, don’t let the puppy on the couch even once. Of course, you do not want your puppy running out the front door at full speed, so it’s up to you to teach them to be in an alternative location other than the door when it opens. Reinforce the behaviors you want to see, redirect the ones that you don’t want to see, and reinforce behaviors that are incompatible with the undesirable one (i.e., go to a mat instead of your lap during meals, chasing other pets, etc.). Whatever puppies perceive as acceptable behavior, even if you’ve said “just this once,” will be sure to continue. They don’t speak English. The entire family must be on board with the rules or the puppy will be confused. Social Skills Puppy kindergarten is an excellent starting point so that your puppy gets used to other dogs, although you usually have to wait until the puppy is up to date inthe series vaccineandBordetella.They learn how to play with dogs that are not litter mates, and how to meet other dogs. Some will be more timid or outgoing than others, but being timid is a red flag and needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. If your puppy is fearful at 12 weeks, you are going to have a fearful adult. Basic social skills are an absolute must unless you are willing to live with a dog that jumps on your grandmother, steals food from your plate, slurps up your dropped medication, takes over the couch,  grabs the barbecue tongs out of your hand, and runs away with your wallet. Generally speaking, the behavior of such a puppy gets worse as they get bigger and older, sometimes to the point where veterinary staff cannot handle the dog and your neighbors are afraid of them, so it needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. Going to training classes and regularly doing the exercises at home is your best bet towards having a dog that you can handle. Understand that training doesn’t train the dog so much as it trains you to train your dog. Puppies explore the world with their mouths. They have tiny, sharp teeth that can’t do much damage but which can be annoying and somewhat painful if they sink into your hand during “play.” Mouthy adults are far more annoying. Although roughhousing will be taken by some children and puppies as a ton of fun, it can lead to the puppy thinking it’s okay to be rough and bite you whereas the opposite is true. Keep the play gentle. Puppies need appropriate socialization to grow into dogs that are good with people, children, and other dogs. Some dogs will always be reactive to other dogs no matter what. Remember that socialization is about exposure and, from the dog’s perspective, good experiences. Puppies should encounter something new every day. Between 8-12 weeks of age, the puppy should be around people wearing all kinds of things, including hats, beards, large purses, sunglasses, and noisy shoes; puppies; adult dogs; dogs that don’t want to play with puppies and say so; people of different color; children of different ages and sounds; and so on.  The more positive experiences the puppy has, the more confident they are as adults. They don’t have to meet people, they can be just sitting away from people, and you can click and treat as people go past. The problem with this time frame is that it should happen while the puppy is still receiving parts of the vaccination series, which lasts until 4 months of age (your veterinarian will determine part of your puppy’s schedule based on geographic location). Those vaccinations are necessary for health and cannot be skipped or delayed. One solution to the vaccination/socialization issue is play dates with puppies and dogs you know are vaccinated (perhaps from puppy kindergarten or obedience classes, or friends and neighbors); and staying away from places that do not require current vaccinations, like dog parks. Puppies are either awake or moving around, playing, running, getting into mischief. They are a ton of work as well as enormous fun. There will be times when you think you are too tired to handle it all, but you can. Eventually that little round belly you love to kiss and the puppy breath you love to smell will be replaced by an adolescent whose visible ribs make it look like you are starving your dog. Adolescents sleep less, play more, usually have housetraining under their belts, and need ever so much exercise. Before you know it, your puppy will be an adult, and you’ll never be able to hold that tiny paw again. Enjoy it while you can! What You Need on Day One Since you will likely have been talking to the people who have the puppy, you have a better chance of having the right equipment at home on Day 1 because you will have had time to prepare, unlike finding a stray. Also, if you shop before the puppy comes home, you won’t bring an immature immune system into the pet supply store where a lot of other dogs have been, giving them a better shot at remaining healthy before their vaccination series is over.  Still, what is necessary on Day 1? What you will need eventually, but do not have to have on Day One While individual dogs prefer less affection than others, puppies want it. They want everything from your family: time, affection, love, gentleness, play, exercise. They must be supervised to see that they don’t ingest ant bait, don’t fall off the deck, are being treated well by family members (no one is pulling the puppy’s tail), aren’t getting out of the yard, and aren’t making a habit of chewing on the couch or peeing behind it. If you find that the puppy is destructive when you leave the house, keep the puppy in the crate when you do leave until the puppy learns the house rules. What you do now for and with your new family member will pay off in significant dividends for the rest of the dog’s life, whether that’s 6-10 years (average life span of a mastiff) or 14-16 (Chihuahua). Your life will be changed for the better. If you think after your puppy has been home for two days that you would do anything to save them, think about how you’ll feel in a decade after the human-animal bond has deepened every passing day. Toxic Substances for Dogs Dogs are a different species, so some things we can eat or ingest may essentially poison them. There’s no need to panic if your 120-lb dog eats two M&Ms, but you do need to be concerned if your 20-lb dog eats half of a chocolate cake. If you know what your dog has ingested, you can callASPCA Poison Control Centerfor a fee, at (888) 426-4435, or contact a veterinarian immediately.

Category: Digging Deeper: Getting the Facts on the Dangers of Antifreeze and Your Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Chances are, you’re already aware of the fact that antifreeze can be a dangerous poison to humans and animals alike. But do you know why the substance is so toxic to pets? Would you know what to do if your pet got into the chemical? Since the winter weather has many people reaching for the antifreeze, theASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC)wants to make sure you know exactly why it’s so important to keep your pets safe from this toxin, what to do if you think they have been exposed, and what can be done to help your pet in the event of an emergency. A key ingredient found in most antifreeze is ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is highly toxic and affects the nervous system and kidneys. What’s worse is that ethylene glycol has a sweet taste, so pets can easily be drawn to and ingest it. It takes only a small amount of ethylene glycol to be potentially fatal.  While problems may start within a couple of hours of ingestion, sometimes early signs may be missed in poisoning cases concerning this ingredient. In six to twelve hours, pets may be markedly ill. While ethylene glycol is most commonly found in antifreeze used in car radiators, that is not the only location it can be found. Antifreeze may also be found in: If you think your pet may have ingested antifreeze, the best thing to do is immediately take them to the veterinary hospital. You’ll also want to be sure to bring with you the packaging from the antifreeze, so the veterinarian can determine the best form of treatment based on the amount ingested and the ingredients listed in the product. At the hospital, the veterinarian will evaluate your pet and run lab tests. If it is uncertain whether your pet was exposed to antifreeze or exposed to enough to be cause for concern, there is a test the veterinarians can run to first determine if the exposure will be harmful or problematic. The good news is, if your pet has ingested antifreeze, there is an antidote. However, it isextremelyimportant to get treatment started as soon as possible. What Else Do you Need to Know? Pet-safe antifreezesdoexist. Instead of containing ethylene glycol, these versions of antifreeze contain propylene glycol—which has a much wider margin of safety. It is still best practice to keep pets out of any type of chemicals, even pet-safe antifreeze. If you suspect your pet has been exposed to any poisonous substances, contact your veterinarian or call Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) at 888-426-4435 immediately.

Category: Expandable Foaming Glues like Gorilla Glue Cause Obstructions in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If swallowed in liquid form, some polyurethane-based glue products can create a life-threatening stomach blockage because they expand and harden once in the stomach. Glues that contain diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), (e.g.  Gorilla Glue™ and Elmer’s Glue-All Max®)are designed to foam and expand after exposure to moisture. These types of glue are most typically used by woodworkers. Unfortunately, if a pet swallows glue with MDI in it, the warm and moist environment of the stomach causes the glue to foam and expand into a large mass. The glue is thought to harden within a few minutes after ingestion, effectively  becoming a foreign body and blocking the entry of food either in or out of the stomach.  When a large amount is ingested, it  hardens in the shape of the stomach. The hardened material usually can't be vomited up because it's too big to go through the esophagus.  While other animals have been known to eat these glues, the typical patient is a dog. Even if you see your pet swallow the glue, do not force him to vomit because this could cause the expanding glue to get stuck in the esophagus or be inhaled into the lungs. Surgically speaking, it is more difficult to  remove the glue from the esophagus than from the stomach. Signs that a pet has eaten this glue can be seen anywhere from 15 minutes to 20 hours after ingestion. These signs include vomiting (sometimes it is bloody), an enlarged stomach, stomach pain, lack of appetite, and lethargy. X-rays of the abdomen are typically necessary to arrive at a diagnosis. Surgery is the only possible treatment as the foam is not digestible.  Surgery is usually done on an emergency basis since stomach ulceration and rupture can occur if the glue is not removed from the stomach in a timely manner. Ingesting a few drops of these glues may not be a problem and would likely just cause mild gastrointestinal distress. If you don’t know how much your pet ingested, then it is wise to consult with your veterinarian, who may recommend taking X-rays. Because MDI isn’t always listed on the product label, consider any expanding adhesive as potentially containing it. To prevent your pets from ingesting these glues or any potentially harmful substance, store them properly and securely where there is no chance your pets could get them.

Category: Snail Bait Poisoning in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Snails and slugs are frustrating garden pests wherever anyone is trying to grow tender flowers or ornamental plants. While effective non-toxic methods abound on the internet, snail bait and snail poisons are readily available in most garden supply stores and pose a significant hazard to the pet dogs that share the garden. Snail bait poisoning continues to be a frequent toxicity issue for dogs in any area where snails are common garden pests. Not that malicious poisoning is the issue; most cases are accidental as many gardens with snail problems also have resident dogs.Snail bait is typically formulated in pellets and flavored with molasses or bran to attract snails. Unfortunately, the pellets resemble kibbled dog food and the molasses and bran are also attractive to dogs. Snail baits are also available as liquids and powders that can get onto paws and be licked off in normal grooming. Very little metaldehyde snail bait is required to cause poisoning: less than a teaspoon per 10 pounds of body weight. Many snail bait products also contain insecticides that make them even more toxic. If at all possible, find out what specific product has been involved in the poisoning so that the veterinarian and animal poison control can determine proper treatment. In a 2002 retrospective study by the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, 28 percent of all metaldehyde poisoning cases happened in California. Obvious Twitching Signs of poisoning begin fairly quickly after the poison is consumed. The dog will begin anxious twitching, at first only slightly and then uncontrollably. This progresses to seizures and potentially to death. The muscle contractions of the twitches raise body temperature so high that brain damage can result, leading to the colloquial emergency room term “shake and bake” syndrome. Patients can also exhibit racing heart rates, vomiting, diarrhea, and rigidity, and respiratory failure. A liver failure syndrome occurs in some patients approximately two to three days after poisoning, so it is important for liver enzymes to be monitored by blood tests throughout the recovery period. Additional liver support medicine may be needed. Making The Diagnosis Generally, the appearance of a twitching patient is characteristic even if there is no known history of snail bait exposure. Testing of stomach contents or urine for metaldehyde can be done, but is generally not necessary. Treatment There is no direct antidote for metaldehyde toxicity; treatment is aimed at controlling the muscle contractions. If less than one hour has passed since exposure, it may be possible to induce vomiting. If the patient is already twitching badly, the stimulation involved in inducing vomiting may not be in the patient’s best interest. In this case, the patient can be anesthetized and the stomach pumped. Activated charcoal can be given to prevent absorption of metaldehyde into the body from the intestine. Cathartics (used to induce diarrhea) can also be used with the activated charcoal to help remove the metaldehyde from the intestinal tract promptly. Twitching can be controlled withmethocarbamol(a muscle relaxant) or injectable benzodiazepine sedatives such asdiazepam. Fluid therapy and body temperature monitoring will be needed throughout the recovery period. Potential for complete recovery depends on how much poison was ingested, how quickly therapy was begun, and the general health of the patient. While this is a serious type of poisoning, most patients have a good chance at recovery if treated properly. At home, the yard should be hosed down with water to dissolve the remaining metaldehyde, and the dog should be restricted from the treated area for a two-week period. This page is dedicated to Justin, a companion to Saeeda, who did not survive his exposure to metaldehyde. We promised to put up a web page in his honor to help educate dog owners and hopefully save the lives of some snail-bait poisoned dogs around the world.

Category: Alcohol Poisoning
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dogs and cats can get more than just drunk when they drink ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol -- they can get a trip to the emergency room. Pets can die from ingesting alcohol. What are ethanol, isopropanol, and methanol? Ethanol(ethyl alcohol) is most commonly formed from the fermentation of sugars. Ethanol is found in alcoholic beverages, some liquid medications and mouthwash bases, rotting/fermenting fruits, and rising (raw) yeast-containing bread dough. The “proof” of ethanol is twice the percentage of alcohol concentration (i.e. 80 proof = 40% ethanol). Although ethanol is also in some household inks, cleaners, and solvents, the levels are low enough to generally be of no clinical significance if these products are ingested by pets. Isopropanol(isopropyl alcohol) is in rubbing alcohol (70%), some anti-freezes, some detergents, glass/window cleaners, perfumes/colognes, and alcohol-based topical sprays, including some pet flea-control and grooming products. Isopropyl alcohol is more than twice as potent as ethanol or methanol. Methanol(methyl alcohol, wood alcohol) is most commonly found in automotive windshield washer fluids (20-80%) but is also in some gasoline additives, “canned heat” fuels (e.g., Sterno®), and some household solvents (e.g., paint removers). Although the strength of these three alcohols varies, the clinical signs associated with their ingestion by dogs and cats are quite similar. All poisoning problems boil down to the amount of alcohol ingested compared to weight, just like a dosage of medicine. Thus, when pets drink an alcoholic beverage that was left within reach or that was given to them intentionally by someone, it can cause a significant toxicity problem. In addition, significant absorption can occur through the skin or by inhalation. Dogs are highly susceptible to the effects of alcohol. Signs of mild inebriation may occur with even minor exposure. Within 15 to 30 minutes after the pet has drunk the alcohol on an empty stomach (or within 1 to 2 hours on a full stomach), central nervous system (CNS) signs, such as staggering, excitement, or decreased reflexes, can begin. Behavioral changes can be seen, as can an increased need to urinate. As the problem gets worse, the pet may become depressed, have a slow respiratory rate, or go into cardiac arrest. Puppies and kittens are at particular risk because of their small size and immature organ systems. Alcohols are depressants, so many of the clinical signs associated with them are due to their effect on the CNS. Alcohols irritate the gastrointestinal tract. They also act as diuretics, and the alcohol and its metabolites are eliminated by the kidneys. Liver damage may occur after exposure, although it is much more common in animals that have repeated or chronic exposure. Clinical Signs Clinical signs of intoxication can occur within 15-30 minutes of ingestion of alcohol. Signs include nausea, vomiting, thirst, urination, dehydration, lethargy, incoordination, disorientation, becoming cold (hypothermia), low blood pressure, and alcoholic bad breath. In severe cases, blindness, tremors, tetraplegia, respiratory depression, coma, or seizures may develop. Death is uncommon but may occur, especially if the pet has severe respiratory and cardiovascular depression, low blood pressure, and/or hypoglycemia. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure, combined with appropriate clinical signs and laboratory tests. Treatment/Management/Prevention The treatments your veterinarian may use can include assisted ventilation, intravenous fluids (to improve elimination of the alcohol/metabolites, to provide cardiovascular support, and to correct electrolyte abnormalities), seizure control, and other supportive therapies. In addition, if the alcohol toxicosis is due to the ingestion of bread dough, your veterinarian may need to wash out your pet's stomach with cold water to inhibit further alcohol production and to break up the dough mass for removal. In addition, your pet will be confined to prevent accidental self-injury. Prognosis Most dogs with alcohol intoxication can recover with adequate symptomatic and supportive care. Recovery may take 8-12 hours and tends to take longer if it was a severe intoxication or if isopropanol was involved. Preventing Alcohol Toxicosis All alcoholic beverages and alcohol-containing fluids should be kept out of reach of your dogs and cats. Consult your veterinarian before giving any ethanol-containing liquid medications. Do not feed raw bread dough to your pets or leave bread dough out to rise in areas that can be reached by them. Always dispose of discarded bread dough carefully. The ASPCANational Animal Poison Controlis available 24 hours a day at 888-426-4435.

Category: Cannabis Toxicity in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cannabis, known by many names, needs little introduction: we all know it is a popular recreational plant smoked and consumed both legally and illegally by millions of people worldwide. What people smoke is the dried flowers and tops of theCannabis sativaplant while "hemp" is a term generally reserved for the stems. It is diverted into assorted consumable forms while hemp is made into rope, canvas, and other materials. Hemp plants are legal to grow so long as they contain less than 0.3% THC, the chief recreational cannabinoid ofCannabis. Cannabinoids are the activeCannabis-derived substances that have pharmaceutical activity. Over 480 relevant substances have been isolated. The amount of each contained in a sample ofCannabiswill depend on the subspecies of plant, how it has been dried, the time of year it was harvested, the age of the plant, and other factors. The body has natural cannabinoid receptors in neurologic cells as well as in immune cells. Effects of cannabinoids are only partly through these receptors. Our bodies make natural cannabinoids as well. Cannabinoids can have assorted pharmaceutical effects: reduction in nausea, induction of euphoria, interference with short term memory and ability to filter insignificant information, increased appetite, antioxidant effects, anti-inflammatory effects, antibacterial effects, and more. The psychoactive chemical that makes a recreational drug is delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly called THC. It is typically 1-8% THC while hashish, made from the flowering tops of the plant and their resins, can contain up to 10% THC. Another cannabinoid chemical is cannabidiol, commonly referred to "CBD", which is not considered recreational and is of a more medicinal nature. Cannabidiol has been used in human medicine to mitigate anxiety, improve appetite, relieve nausea, control seizures of certain types, and assist in sleep disorders. Assorted CBD products are available for human use both online and through dispensaries. Some products are marketed for pet use though is, with rare exception, not legal (see section below). Cannabisplants have been used medicinally for thousands of years.Cannabiswas made illegal in the U.S. first in 1911 and was ultimately listed in the Controlled Substance Act of 1970 as a schedule I substance, meaning that it has no accepted medical use. In recent years, attitudes have changed and medical use first became legal in 1996. As medical uses for cannabinoids are being explored and more states legalize medical and recreationalCannabis, exposure of pets to THC has increased dramatically, particularly in dogs. CannabisIntoxication in Dogs The usual pet toxicity case involves a dog that has inadvertently eaten it. In dogs, clinical signs typically begin 30 to 90 minutes after it has been eaten. Because THC is stored in the body’s fat deposits, the effects of ingestion can last for several days. SymptomsSigns include: incoordination and listlessness along with dilated pupils, slow heart rate and sometimes urinary incontinence. A characteristic startle reaction has been described where the pet appears drowsy and even may begin to fall over but catches balance.Cannabistoxicity can look similar to intoxication with numerous other sedatives, but the most serious consideration is anti-freeze poisoning, which looks similar in its early stages and is usually fatal if not diagnosed early. The dog inthis videostole aCannabis-containing baked good from the owner. Note the characteristic startle response and balance issues. It is important for all the relevant exposure information to be given to the veterinarian if the pet is to be helped; veterinarians are not obligated to report anything to local police. If you knowCannabiswas involved in an intoxication, you must tell the attending doctor. Obviously this goes for other recreational drugs as well. Urine testing similar to that done with humans can be done in dogs to make the diagnosis ofCannabisintoxication. Test kits are available at most drug stores and can include assays for a number of recreational drugs. A relatively large volume is needed to run these tests, so if the pet is small this may be difficult to obtain, particularly in a female. Also, false negatives are common when the THC urine test is performed on pet urine; a positive is confirmatory but there are many false negatives as the metabolites relevant to the test are different between dogs and humans. In most cases, the diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation of the dog plus history ofCannabisexposure. TreatmentIf less than 30 minutes have passed since theCannabishas been eaten, it may be possible to induce vomiting, but after symptoms have started the nausea control properties of the cannabidiol make it difficult to induce vomiting. Furthermore, if the patient is extremely sedated, vomiting can be dangerous as vomit can be inhaled and cause a serious and deadly aspiration pneumonia. Activated charcoal is a liquid material used in treating poisoning. Activated charcoal is given orally and as it passes from one end to the other, toxins are trapped in the charcoal so that when the charcoal passes from the patient, the toxins pass too. This technique of detoxification may be used to treatCannabistoxicity if ingestion has occurred recently. Fluid support and keeping the patient warm may also be needed. If the patient has lost consciousness, then more intense observation and support is needed. The chance of fatality is statistically small but possible. In most cases, the patient can simply be confined to prevent injury until the THC wears off. MedicalCannabisProducts for Pet Use As medicinalCannabisbecomes legal and commonplace in the U.S., many people wish to try products on their pets. Some cannabinoid companies even make products packaged for pet use. There are several reasons to be cautious about using these products. Here are some to consider: Cannaboids will interact with other medications so if you plan to use any of these products, be sure your veterinarian is aware that you are doing so. Keep any medicinal or recreational products out of the reach of pets and children.

Category: Cannabis Toxicity in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An Overview Cannabisgenerally refers to the products of theCannabis sativaplant, commonly known as marijuana. TheCannabis sativaplant uniquely has over 100 different chemicals called phytocannabinoids. (Phytomeans plant.) The most well-known of these isdelta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, referred to as THC. THC has psychoactive effects on the brain, making it popular for recreational use. Psychoactive substances affect the mind or behavior and work on the nervous system, altering mood and feeling and making marijuana popular for recreational use. However, because THC affects many other body systems, it also has many medical uses. In fact, marijuana has been safely used medically for centuries. In the United States, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has classified THC as a Schedule 1 drug. Schedule 1 drugs have no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Despite this classification, almost all states have legalized marijuana for either recreational or medical use. Another cannabinoid found in theCannabis sativaplant, called cannabidiol (CBD), is also popular, but because it does not have psychoactive effects, its popularity is primarily because of medical benefits. Marijuana contains at least 1% THC, although this percentage depends on what part of the plant is used and how it is processed. Products made from marijuana seeds contain little or no THC, but products made from the plant's buds or flowers can contain up to 10% THC. In recent years, selective plant breeding has produced levels of THC up to 50%. The United States government has legalized a differentCannabis sativaplant called industrial hemp. Hemp can contain no more than 0.3% THC, but it can contain larger amounts of a second phytocannabinoid, cannabidiol or CBD. Because it contains little THC, the DEA does not control hemp or its products, and they are not considered illegal by the federal government. Because it is not illegal, many dietary supplements containing CBD are now being marketed for medical use in animals. How It Works The phytocannabinoids THC and CBD inCannabis sativawork through the body’s natural endocannabinoid system (ECS). (Endomeans self.) The chemicals in the ECS interact with the cannabinoid receptors found throughout the body, helping to regulate physiologic functions, and may be involved in different diseases. Using drugs to influence this system may help in the treatment of disease. The medical effects of THC and CBD differ because they interact differently with the endocannabinoid system. In human medicine, CDB has been used to treat anxiety, improve appetite, relieve nausea, control certain types of seizures, and assist in sleep disorders. In animals, pain associated with osteoarthritis and seizures associated with epilepsy are common uses of CBD. CBD and Supplements CBD is not psychoactive like THC but may have medical benefits. CBD is not a scheduled drug by the DEA and is an added ingredient in dietary supplements sold online, at dispensaries, and available over the counter. THC and CBD are also available by prescription, and your veterinarian may prescribe one or the other for treating your pet, most commonly for pain management. The difference between supplements and prescription drugs is that unapproved products like supplements are not regulated, nor are they assessed for consistency. Supplement labels may inaccurately list the amount of CBD in the product. More importantly, supplements may contain chemicals such as synthetic cannabinoids that are not listed on the label but may be dangerous to your pet. In general, marijuana is safe. People are generally exposed to higher amounts of THC than pets because people more commonly smoke, rather than ingest, marijuana. THC that is ingested (for example, marijuana cookies) is removed mainly by the liver before it can get into the blood. THC that is inhaled bypasses the liver, and most of it enters the blood. Toxicity in THC vs CBD Because of its psychogenic effects, products containing THC are more likely to cause clinical signs that look like toxicity in dogs or cats. However, in contrast to marijuana or THC, products containing CBD have not been associated with significant toxicity or side effects in dogs. Toxicity or side effects tocannabismost likely reflect the effects of THC rather than CBD but are rarely lethal. In cases in which side effects were reported with a supplement containing CBD, the supplement also contained THC. Even then, the side effects involved the gastrointestinal tract (vomiting, diarrhea) and were not severe. An exception is those products that contain synthetic cannabinoids or if other drugs have been unknowingly added. These products can be life-threatening. This is another reason that it is important to bring the actual product to your veterinarian. Different cannabinoids have varied effects. Each cannabinoid may reach a different area of the body. Responses to CBD among animals may reflect the differences in individual endocannabinoid systems. Keep any medicinal or recreational products out of the reach of pets and children. Signs of Marijuana Toxicity in Pets The legalization of marijuana has led to increased reports of toxicity in dogs and cats. Most pet exposure to marijuana occurs after eating homemade baked goods containing the dried marijuana plant (about 70%), followed by eating the plant itself (about 10%). For marijuana toxicity to occur, the pet must eat a large amount of marijuana. The amount of marijuana plant necessary to cause death in a dog or cat has not been determined. However, the least amount that has ever been associated with signs of toxicity is 3 to 9 g per kg of animal weight (about 7 to 20 g per lb.). For comparison, the average marijuana cigarette generally contains only about 0.5 to 1 gram of plant material. A problem with dogs ingesting marijuana in baked goods such as brownies or cookies is that they oftencontain chocolate, which is also toxic to dogs. Baked products may also contain concentrated forms of marijuana butter or oil. Another possible reason for marijuana toxicity in dogs is that marijuana may contain unsafe, illegal substances such as other drugs or synthetic cannabinoids. In cases where death has been reported in dogs, the marijuana most commonly was in baked goods. Chocolate may contain thesugar substitute xylitol, a substance that is toxic to dogs. After ingestion, the time it takes for clinical signs to occur and how long it takes for the pet to become normal again depends, in part, on how much marijuana and what else might have been ingested. Clinical signs can appear as early as 30 minutes after exposure but may take up to two hours to occur. After ingestion, pets may become normal again in as little as a couple of hours, but more often, it takes 24 to 72 hours for pets to return to normal. A common clinical sign of marijuana toxicity is loss of urination control. Because this sign does not occur with other toxins, it helps with the diagnosis. Other common clinical signs of toxicity include: Rarely, the pet may become aggressive. With the most severe toxicity, seizures may occur, or the pet may become comatose. Pets that already have illness may be more likely to become ill. Clinical signs in these pets may depend on what other illnesses they have. Compared to humans, a dog has many cannabinoid receptors around the brain that help with balance. When dogs ingest a large amount of THC, they may become uncoordinated and unable to stand. This THC side effect in dogs is not likely to occur with CBD or in other species. Diagnosing marijuana toxicity can be difficult. It is important that your veterinarian be given any information that might help with identifying the cause of the clinical signs. Bringing the actual product your pet was exposed to with you to the clinic can help. There is no risk to you as the pet owner because your veterinarian is not required to report toxicity to local law enforcement. In humans, urine tests are used to detect chemicals metabolized in urine from THC. However, animals do not make these metabolites, so these types of urine tests are not helpful. Treatment for Toxicity Diagnosis and treatment of marijuana toxicity depend on a well-informed veterinarian. There is no specific antidote for marijuana toxicity. Treatments are given help to control the clinical signs. This might include fluids or drugs to control vomiting and, for severe toxicity, antiseizure medications. Usually, the patient is sent home after a physical examination. The pet can be kept in a confined space and monitored until the effects wear off. However, more intense in-hospital observation and support are needed if the patient has lost consciousness. If less than 30 minutes have passed since theCannabishas been eaten, it may be possible to induce vomiting. However, the pet may inhale stomach contents, particularly if it is acting sedated. This option may be necessary if the pet ingested a life-threatening toxin. In more severe cases of toxicity, your veterinarian may give activated charcoal orally. This is a liquid that helps to bind ingested toxins. The toxin passes along with the charcoal when the pet defecates. However, this should not be given to patients that are sedated. Cannabinoids might interact with other medications. For example, they may cause other medications to leave the body more slowly. It is important to notify your veterinarian if your pet is receivingcannabisor any supplement. The ASPCANational Animal Poison Controlis available 24 hours a day at 888-426-4435.

Category: Chocolate Toxicity in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Chocolate may be America’s favorite flavor. We like chocolate candy, ice cream, chocolate drinks, chocolate cakes, and just about anything with chocolate. We may want to share our favorite treat with an eager pet but it is best to think twice and reach for the dog biscuits instead. Different Types of Chocolate and How They Are Made Anyone who has ever eaten candy knows there are many types of chocolate: milk, dark, white, unsweetened, cocoa powder, etc. It turns out each type has a different potential for toxicity. In order to understand which types of chocolates are more toxic, we will need to review how chocolate is made. Cocao trees, which require a tropical climate, are farmed in orchards like any other fruit-bearing tree. The fruit of the cacao tree, called a cacao pod, is sweet and attracts monkeys or other wildlife who eat the fruit but not the bitter seeds. The seeds are discarded in the natural setting, allowing new trees to grow. Outside of the farm situation, the seeds cannot be released from the fruit unless some type of animal breaks the fruit open. Ironically, it is the bitter seeds, packed with theobromine and caffeine, which are used to make chocolate. The pods grow directly off the trunk of the cacao tree and must be harvested by hand so as not to damage the tree. The pods are split, and the seeds are scooped out and left to ferment under banana leaves for about a week. This process turns the cocoa seeds into the rich brown color with which we are familiar and creates the chocolate flavor we crave. The seeds are then dried out for another week, packed in sacks, and shipped to chocolate manufacturers. The seeds must be roasted, ground, pressed to remove the seed oil (this oil is called cocoa butter, which is used in sunscreens, white chocolate, and cosmetics, among other things), and finally tempered to create the exact consistency. Pancreatitis Sometimes we eat chocolate plain, as in candy. Sometimes we eat it baked into cakes, mixed into ice cream, etc. Sometimes we share these treats with pets, and sometimes, our pets share these treats without our permission. As far as pets are concerned, the first potential problem with these sweets is the fat. A sudden high-fat meal (such as demolishing a bag of chocolate bars left accessible at Halloween time) can create a lethal metabolic disease in dogs called pancreatitis.  Vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are just the beginning of this disaster. Remember, in the case ofpancreatitis, it is the fat that causes the problem more than the chocolate itself. The fat and sugar in the chocolate can create an unpleasant but temporary upset stomach. This is what happens in most chocolate ingestion cases. Theobromine and Caffeine Chocolate is, however, directly toxic because it contains methylxanthines. In particular, the methylxanthines chocolate contains are theobromine and caffeine. Both caffeine and theobromine produce similar effects, with the theobromine effects lasting much longer than the caffeine. The more chocolate liquor there is in a product, the more theobromine there is. This makes baking chocolate the worst for pets, followed by semisweet and dark chocolate, followed by milk chocolate, followed by chocolate-flavored cakes or cookies. Theobromine causes: Toxic doses of theobromine are 9 mg per pound of the dog’s weight for mild signs and up to 18 mg per pound for severe signs. Milk chocolate contains 44 mg per ounce of theobromine, semisweet chocolate contains 150 mg per ounce, and baking chocolate contains 390 mg per ounce. White chocolate has virtually no theobromine and is only a problem because of its fat content. These calculations seem complex, and they certainly can be. What it boils down to is that your veterinarian will need to know the type of chocolate and how many ounces were most likely consumed. If it is not clear how much chocolate was actually consumed, the largest possible amount should be determined based on how much candy, cake, etc., is missing. It takes nearly four days for the effects of chocolate to work its way out of a dog’s system. If the chocolate was only just eaten, it is possible to induce vomiting; otherwise, hospitalization and support are needed. It is common for clinics to receive phone calls about pets who were found to have consumed a chocolate product, and the owner wishes to know if the amount was toxic. In order to answer such questions, it is necessary to know the pet's weight, the type of chocolate, and the amount of chocolate. Chocolate calculators are available at most veterinary practices, and it can be determined relatively quickly if the pet should be made to vomit immediately. Treatment As mentioned, the first step is to remove as much chocolate from the body as possible by inducing vomiting or using adsorbents such as activated charcoal to bind the chocolate and keep it from being absorbed by the GI tract.  For many patients, removing undigested chocolate converts the toxicity from neurologic poisoning to just an upset stomach that is easily managed. If too much caffeine/theobromine has been absorbed, the treatment is support: sedation for the tremors and intravenous medications for any cardiac arrhythmias. Support is needed until the toxins have been processed and removed from the body so expect severe cases to need intravenous fluid support and hospitalization for a few days. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Keep chocolate treats where your pet cannot reach them.

Category: Chocolate Toxicity Signs in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most pet owners know thatchocolate is bad for dogsand can cause significant problems for a dog; cats are usually too finicky to eat it. But what signs of chocolate toxicity should you look for when you know your dog ate chocolate, and what should you do? Signs to Watch For The active ingredient in chocolate that causes problems with dogs is called theobromine, which is a distant cousin of caffeine. Some of the signs are caused by excitation to the nervous system, like a caffeine overdose.  Look for: Just ingesting chocolate, which most dogs don’t typically eat every day, can cause an upset stomach.  In these cases, you can see: If you notice any symptoms after your dog eats chocolate, it's best to have them evaluated by a veterinarian or emergency clinic quickly. The theobromine can also cause a dangerously rapid heart rate and high blood pressure, both of which may require treatment. What to Do A small amount of milk chocolate, like the amount found in a chocolate chip cookie, is not a problem. For larger, recent exposures, just getting your dog to vomit the chocolate is enough. Your veterinarian or local emergency clinic can help you with this, so call them if your dog has ingested chocolate. They can help you decide when, how, and where to induce vomiting and if further therapy is needed. In cases where a dog is showing signs of chocolate toxicity, they can also start treatment and contact an animal poison control center for guidance.

Category: Electronic Cigarettes are Toxic to Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Electronic cigarettes, often called e-cigs, are marketed as an alternative to cigarette smoking.  They are also referred to as personal vaporizers or electronic nicotine delivery systems. These devices have a cylindrical body that holds a cartridge containing a liquid solution; some resemble tobacco cigarettes.  The solution, termed “e-liquid” or “e-juice,” contains a base material, flavoring compounds, and nicotine. The base material is generally propylene glycol and either vegetable glycerin or polyethylene glycol. Glycerin and propylene glycol are of low toxicity when eaten, but the amount in the refill bottles (usually 10-30% of what's in the bottle) is low enough to not be much of a concern; nicotine is the bigger issue. Whether any of the compounds used are toxic if inhaled long term is not known. The nicotine levels in these e-liquids can vary in concentration from being completely nicotine-free up to 36 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) of nicotine. For marketing purposes, the “/mL” part is frequently dropped, and the e-liquids are advertised as having X mg of nicotine rather than X mg/mL. In some e-cigs, the user controls the amount of nicotine delivered by adjusting the flow of e-liquid from the cartridge. An e-cig with a full cartridge can contain up to 36 mg of nicotine, which doesn’t sound like a lot until you factor in how toxic nicotine is.  Clinical signs of nicotine poisoning can be seen in dogs and cats exposed to a mere 0.5 mg per pound of body weight.  For cats and small dogs, ingesting 20 mg of nicotine can be lethal. Even more dangerous are the bottles of e-liquid that are used to recharge the e-cig cartridge: the nicotine in these bottles can range from 10 mL to 60 mL or more.  So a 30-mL bottle of 36 mg/mL e-liquid will contain 1080 mg of nicotine, more than enough to prove fatal for even a very large dog if the contents are ingested. Nicotine is readily absorbed by ingestion as well as through the skin.  Pets may be exposed when they chew up the e-cigs or the bottles containing e-juice or even when they walk through puddles of spilled e-juice and get it on their paws.  The signs of nicotine poisoning may begin within 15 to 30 minutes of exposure to the e-liquid; in contrast, signs of nicotine poisoning following eating tobacco products may take a few hours as the nicotine must be released from the tobacco. The first signs normally seen with toxic exposure to nicotine include: With severe intoxications, signs may progress to include: Further progression of signs may result in profound weakness, paralysis, abnormal heart rhythms (including cardiac arrest), hypotension, coma, and death. Prompt and aggressive veterinary care is required to successfully manage poisoning from e-juice exposure.  Because the e-juice is rapidly absorbed across the mucous membranes of the mouth, standard decontamination measures such as inducing vomiting are usually not helpful.  Treatment includes managing convulsions and seizures, treating heart and blood pressure abnormalities, ensuring adequate respiration, and providing intravenous fluids to enhance nicotine elimination.The prognosis for patients exposed to large amounts of nicotine can be quite grave depending on how quickly veterinary care is obtained, and even with aggressive veterinary care, some patients will not survive.

Category: Salmon Poisoning in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Salmon poisoning is also known as salmon disease, salmon poisoning disease (SPD), andNeorickettsia helminthoecainfection. It is an acute, and often fatal, infectious disease of dogs, coyotes, and foxes of the Pacific Northwest. This disease has been found in black bears and Malayan sun bears, but has not been reported in cats. Despite its name, salmon poisoning does not involve a toxin. Salmon poisoning is an infection that develops when dogs eat raw or undercooked fish (salmon, trout, or steelhead) or Pacific Giant Salamanders that contain a fluke. A fluke, also known as a trematode, is an internal parasite. In this case, the fluke isNanophyetus salmincolathat contains a rickettsial organism calledNeorickettsia helminthoeca. Once the larval flukes reach the dog's intestinal tract, they embed in the dog's duodenal mucosa, and release the rickettsiae. The rickettsial organisms then spread through the bloodstream to the liver, lungs, brain, and lymphoid tissue. Clinical signs include, but are not limited to: fever; nausea; vomiting; bloody diarrhea; weight loss; ascites; nasal and eye discharge; enlarged lymph nodes; tachypnea; dyspnea; tachycardia; twitching; and seizures. Approximately 60 percent of cases have generalized lymph node enlargement. Unless the infection is treated, 50 – 90% of affected animals will die of the infection within 7 to 10 days. Clinical signs usually begin about one week after the animal eats the infected raw fish, although delays of 33 days have been reported. Geographic Distribution Although infected fish can be found in the Pacific Ocean from San Francisco to the coast of Alaska, salmon poisoning is most commonly found in Washington, Oregon, northern California, and southern Vancouver Island (Canada). It is also seen inland, along the rivers of fish migration. The Pacific Northwest has the trematode's first intermediate host, a small snail calledOxytrema plicifer. Diagnosis Although clinical signs are caused by the rickettsial organisms and not the fluke, presumptive diagnosis is usually made by identifying the fluke’s ova (eggs) in the feces. Ova are identified in 92% of cases. Direct smears of fecal material usually provide sufficient specimens for diagnosis, although other methods can be used. Lymph node cytology and histopathology may provide a more definitive diagnosis, if necessary. A history of access to raw fish also aids in diagnosis. Treatment To combat the hemorrhage, necrosis, and infection, affected animals usually need antibiotics, fluid therapy, blood transfusions, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, and anticestodals (drugs that kill flukes). PrognosisMany dogs respond well to antibiotic therapy, and resolution of gastrointestinal signs, fever, and thrombocytopenia can occur within 24-72 hours of starting therapy. However, if treatment is not started, death can occur 7-10 days after the onset of clinical signs. In one report, overall mortality rate was 14%. In another study of 43 dogs that were treated with antibiotics, 39 survived. Preventive Measures Dogs should not be allowed to eat raw or smoked-raw fish (salmon, trout, steelhead), or Pacific Giant Salamanders. Dogs that survive salmon poisoning will be immune to re-infection with the same strain. However, infection with an alternate strain can occur because there is no cross-protection.

Category: The Wrath of Grapes
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   Magoo was a big, playful Labrador retriever who often got himself into some sticky situations. Usually, his escapades were harmless. But one day, he managed to snag a box of raisins from the pantry and ended up eating an entire pound of the sweet treats. Other than being exasperated by Magoo's behavior, his guardians didn't think much about it. They knew that lots of people shared grapes with their dogs and often used raisins as training rewards. So it hardly seemed the kind of emergency that required a call to the veterinarian. In fact, if Magoo's parents had called the ASPCA's Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) just a few years ago, they would have been told not to worry about it. Through the Grapevine Enter the APCC AnToxTMdatabase, a computerized system that contains nearly 500,000 animal-related medical conditions and that enables veterinarians to quickly identify toxic substance exposures, recognize clinical signs, and administer proper treatment. By tracking cases in this registry, similarities in animal medical conditions nationwide can be logged and syndromes can be identified. Around 1999, the APCC began noticing a trend in dogs who had eaten grapes or raisins: Nearly all developed acute renal (kidney) failure. As more cases were reported, enough data was generated in the database to help veterinarians identify and treat dogs at risk. In all of the cases, the ingredients for potential acute renal failure were the same. Whether the ingested grapes were purchased fresh from grocery stores or grown in private yards didn't seem to matter, nor did the brand eaten. And the ingested amounts varied considerably, from over a pound of grapes to as little as a single serving of raisins. The cases weren't from any specific region, but instead came from across the United States. The database showed that dogs who ate the grapes and raisins typically vomited within a few hours of ingestion. Most of the time, partially digested grapes and raisins could be seen in the vomit, fecal material, or both. At this point, some dogs would stop eating (anorexia), and develop diarrhea. The dogs often became quiet and lethargic, and showed signs of abdominal pain. These clinical signs lasted for several days -- sometimes even weeks. When medical care was sought, blood chemistry panels showed consistent patterns. Hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels) was present, as well as elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and phosphorous (substances that tell your veterinarian about your pet's kidney function). These blood work values began to increase anywhere from 24 hours to several days after the dogs ate the fruit. As the kidney damage developed, the dogs would produce little urine. When they could no longer produce urine, death occurred. In some cases, dogs who received timely veterinary care still had to be euthanized. Why Did the Fruit Cause Illness? There are still many unknowns. Suspect grapes and raisins have been screened for various pesticides, heavy metals (such as zinc or lead), and mycotoxins (fungal contaminants) and so far, all results have come back negative. In cases where the grapes were grown in private yards, owners confirmed that no insecticides, fertilizers, or antifungals had been used on the fruit. Tartaric acid, a chemical found in grapes and raisins, was shown to contribute to the kidney damage seen with intoxication in one study. However, more studies are needed to prove or refute this theory. "Raisin" the Success Rate Even though the exact cause of renal failure is unknown, dogs who ingest grapes and raisins can be treated successfully to prevent its development. The first line of defense is decontamination. Inducing vomiting in recent ingestions and administering activated charcoal helps prevent the absorption of potential toxins. Dogs should be hospitalized and placed on intravenous fluids for at least 48 hours. A veterinarian should monitor blood chemistry daily for at least three days following the ingestion. If all blood work is normal after three days, it's unlikely that kidney failure will occur. If a dog shows evidence of renal failure, fluids must be continued, and other medications should be used to stimulate urine production. Some dogs may need peritoneal dialysis, a process where the peritoneum (the membranes surrounding the abdominal organs) is used to filter waste products that are normally filtered by the kidney. Thanks in part to the AnTox database, grape or raisin ingestion can be easily identified and treated. Today, a dog can make a complete recovery from this potentially fatal condition.

Category: Yeast Dough Dangers in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you bake yeast bread from scratch, it is essential that you keep all raw bread dough away from your pets. Ingesting it can cause serious problems and be life threatening for your pet. Doughs that do not contain yeast are less of a concern, but can still cause gastrointestinal problems. Why is it so dangerous to eat? Yeast is a microscopic fungus that, under the right conditions, makes carbon dioxide gas and ethanol (alcohol) from sugar. This effect is great for making bread because gas makes the dough rise and ethanol flavors the bread before burning off in the oven. However, this process is dangerous when it occurs in your animal's stomach. Being moist and warm, the stomach is essentially the perfect environment for yeast to grow and pump out carbon dioxide and ethanol. The buildup of gas and rising dough in the stomach is painful and can lead to a condition calledbloat: “the mother of all emergencies.”Also known as gastric dilatation and volvulus, or GDV, bloat is where the expanding stomach puts pressure on surrounding areas and decreases blood flow to important organs. Even more dangerous, the stomach may eventually twist, cutting off blood flow even more. The twisted stomach can reduce blood flow throughout the whole body, leading to a serious condition calledshock. Several steps are needed to save a bloated dog’s life. Part of the problem is that the main three steps - decompress the stomach, give IV fluids to fight shock, and stabilize the heart rhythm - should all be done at the same time and as quickly as possible. Although GDV can be life threatening, death from yeast dough in pets is usually due to the effects of ethanol. Ethanol is alcohol, like that found in beer, wine and spirits,  so the ethanol produced by yeast can causealcohol poisoning. This poisoning can lead to low blood sugar, low blood pressure, decreased body temperature,seizuresand trouble breathing. Signs Early signs of yeast dough ingestion are generally those associated with bloat. Your pet may try to vomit or retch but not produce anything or maybe just a little white foam. Additional signs include an enlarged abdomen due to the buildup of gas and dough, in addition to weakness, increased heart rate, and collapse. Signs of alcohol poisoning generally occur two or more hours after dough is ingested. You might be able to smell alcohol on your pet's breath. Your pet may seem drunk, becoming uncoordinated and disoriented. They may also feel cold to the touch. Seizures and trouble breathing are two other serious signs of alcohol poisoning. What should I Do? Get to a veterinarian as soon as possible, as this is potentially a life-threatening emergency. If your pet just recently ate the dough and isn't showing any symptoms yet, your veterinarian may try to induce vomiting to remove it from the stomach. As you can imagine, bread dough is so gummy and sticky that it is hard to vomit up. So, other methods of removal will likely be necessary. Yeastlovethe warmth in a stomach. If you make the stomach cold, you can slow the yeast's growth and the production of alcohol and gas. This slow down can be accomplished by feeding ice chips or flushing the stomach with cold water. These treatments can also break up the dough and make it easier to pass through the rest of the digestive system. In rare cases, the dough may need to be surgically removed. Treatment also involves dealing with your pet's specific clinical signs and may entail giving intravenous fluids to correct any blood abnormalities and to speed up removing alcohol from the bloodstream. If your pet is cold, heating blankets, warm intravenous fluids and other techniques may be used to warm them up. Depending on your pet's symptoms, medications may be given to reduce pain, treat seizures, correct breathing abnormalities, manage vomiting, etc. The veterinarian will need to monitor your pet for at least 12 hours until they recover. Prognosis Pets generally do well if the yeast dough is removed quickly and they are treated soon after ingestion. Unfortunately, pets suffering from severe alcohol poisoning, bloat, or GDV have a more guarded prognosis. To prevent this life-threatening situation altogether, avoid letting your pets have access to raw yeast dough by letting it rise in areas your pets can't reach, such as elevated places in the kitchen, or in a closed oven or microwave.

Category: Rattlesnake Bites in California
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English First, Some Venomous Snake Terminology Venomous SnakesVenomous animals secrete toxic substances that they use to immobilize and potentially kill their prey. There are many venomous animals including spiders, stinging insects, lizards, and, of course, snakes. There are four types of venomous snakes but the type that is responsible for 99% of venomous snake bites in North America are vipers. Vipers can be "old world vipers" or "pit vipers." In North America, we have pit vipers, chiefly rattlesnakes, cottonmouths (also called water moccassins) and copperheads.  Rattlesnakes are the most poisonous. Pit Vipers (Also Known as Crotaline or Crotalid Vipers)Pit vipers are named for their facial heat sensing organ, which is called a loreal pit. The snakes with hinged fangs, such as the rattlers, will strike delivering their poison, release the prey, and then look for the dead body. The prey is rapidly killed through an assortment of complicated mechanisms and the digestion process is actually initiated by the venom. Snake venoms are highly complicated. At least 26 separate enzymes have been identified with 10 of these enzymes common to all snake venoms (though in different concentrations). All snake bites are not equal. The quality of venom depends not only on the type of snake but on the season, the geographical region, the age of the snake, and how recently it has released venom previously. Treatment depends on the type of venom but more on this later. The only venomous snakes in California are the rattlesnakes and there are eight species: the Southern Pacific rattlesnake, the Northern Pacific rattlesnake, the Great Basin rattlesnake, the Western diamondback, the red diamondback, the sidewinder, the speckled rattlesnake, and the Mojave green rattlesnake. The Western rattlesnake has eight subspecies including the Southern Pacific rattlesnake, which is the only one native to the Los Angeles Basin. Ask your veterinarian what venomous species are native to your area. The physical appearance of each snake species is variable and it is difficult to tell what species of snake you are looking at. Some general principles in distinguishing poisonous snakes are: Rattlesnakes can be found in rural areas as well as suburban areas where there is sufficient natural habitat. In Northern California snakes will hibernate during cold months and are active March through September. In Southern California they are active all year round. Dogs Vs. Snakes Dogs encounter snakes in the snake's natural habitat during play or work. Most bites to dogs occur on the face or extremities. The rattlesnake bite is generally hemotoxic, which means that it exerts its toxin by disrupting the integrity of the blood vessels. The swelling is often dramatic with up to one-third of the total blood circulation being lost into the tissues in a matter of hours. The toxin further disrupts normal blood clotting mechanisms, leading to uncontrolled bleeding. This kind of blood loss induces shock and finally death. Facial bites are often more lethal as the swelling may close the throat or impair ability to breathe. The bite of this Mojave rattlesnake causes rapid paralysis. This includes paralysis of the respiratory muscles and suffocation. Because the Mojave rattlesnake venom is different, treatment may be different and snake venom vaccine (see below) is not protective against this venom. The severity of a snake bite depends largely on these factors: The amount of venom injected (approximately 20-25 percent of bites are dry, meaning no venom has been injected; 30 percent of bites are mild meaning they cause local pain and swelling in the bite area and no systemic symptoms; 40 percent of bites are severe with approximately five percent being fatal. Treatment The faster the bite is recognized, the more effective the treatment is. Do not try to cut the bite wound open or suck out the poison. Pressure bandages have been advocated but while these will help keep the poison from moving centrally in the circulation, they also can increase the local tissue damage by concentrating the poison near the bite wound. It is best to seek veterinary care immediately for proper treatment.Seek veterinary care immediately for proper treatment, even if your dog has been vaccinated against snake venom. IV FluidsSince the most common mechanism of death from rattlesnake bite is circulatory collapse, IV support and monitoring for signs of blood pressure drop are important. Fluids may be started at a relatively slow rate if the patient is stable but if signs of impending trouble occur, circulatory volume replacement is as easy as opening a drip set valve. After a bite, 24 hours of observation is a prudent timeframe while giving IV fluids throughout. AntiveninThere are numerous misconceptions about antivenin. The first is simply the name of the product.It is not “anti-venom.”It is not a single injection that provides the antidote to snake bite venom. Antivenin is a biological product consisting of antibodies made by horses in response to exposure to four common Crotaline venoms. The antibody serum is reconstituted into an intravenous drip that is run into the patient over at least 30 minutes or so. Antivenin is expensive (at least $400 per vial) and a large dog with a severe bite is likely to require several vials. Because the product is of horse origin, often a scratch test to the ear flap is used to test for immunological sensitivity (i.e. to predict whether the patient is likely to have anaphylactic reaction to the antivenin once it is given by IV). The patient will likely always be sensitive to equine products after being given antivenin, which makes future snake bite treatment problematic. A more purified antivenin of sheep origin has recently been marketed (Cro-Fab antivenin) but this is even more expensive at approximately $700 per vial. This product is made for human use but also works in dogs. Other products include: Rattler Antivenin® (which actually includes antivenin against the Mojave green rattlesnake), VenomVet®, Antivipmyn Tri® (a Mexican product), and Polivet-ICP® (a Costa Rican product). Antivenin is very helpful in the inactivation of snake venom but there is a narrow window during which it must be used. After about 4 hours post-bite, antivenin is of minimal use. A separate antivenin is available for coral snake venom but this is not an issue for California. Suctioning of the snake bite and using bands or tourniquets to prevent the venom from traveling are urban legends and should not be done. It may be helpful to remove collars or other items that could become constrictive once the swelling starts. Vaccination Red Rock Biologics has released a vaccination against the venom of the Western Diamondback (Crotalus atrox). This vaccine also has activity against the venom of six out of seven of the other California rattlesnakes (the Mojave Rattlesnake has such significantly different venom that it is not covered) and there is at least partial cross-protection against numerous other venomous snakes native to areas outside California. Hiking dogs and dogs that live in rattlesnake areas are good candidates for this product. That said, there is controversy about how well it works as the manufacturer does not wish to do efficacy testing that would involve a control group of unvaccinated dogs. Furthermore, a history of vaccination does not preclude the need for emergency treatment after snake bite; the goal of the vaccine is to lessen the poisoning. Efficacy studies thus far have involved mice. Basics about the Vaccine A snake bite should always be treated as an emergency even in a vaccinated dog.If your dog is bitten by a rattlesnake, seek veterinary attention immediately. Snake Avoidance Training Dogs can be trained to avoid rattlesnakes by scent, sound, and visual appearance. Training classes exist just for this purpose. If your dog hikes in snake territory, consider looking into one of these classes. Call training schools or ask your veterinarian about these specialized classes.

Category: Snake Bite Prevention and Treatment for Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most snakes will try to avoid you or your pets; snakes typically bite only as a last resort. But while you may wisely decide to simply walk away when you encounter a snake, dogs and cats will often harass the sliding invader -- and may get bitten as a result. Snakes help protect your garden and yard plants because they eat rodents and insects. Most of the snakes you will find are not a problem and they don't harm property. While hiking, stay on open paths. Off-trail hiking can stir up snakes. Keep your dog on leash and away from high grass and rocky outcrops in which snakes like to rest. Don't let the dog explore holes or dig under rocks or logs. Remember that rattlers are nocturnal, so daytime hikes are safer. If you hear a rattling noise, keep your dog at your side until you figure out where the snake is, and then move away with your dog. Your best bet is to stay vigilant and keep control of your dog when walking in snake habitats. If you see a snake that sees you, remember that a snake can strike only a distance of half its body length. Give the snake time to just go away. Snakes are not looking to interact with people or pets, either defensively or aggressively. Don't let your pet examine "road kill" snakes. Dead pit vipers can have some muscle contractions after death, and thus have been known to "bite" even after they're dead. Those bites can still envenomate. Don't handle a dead or injured snake - not even a decapitated head. If your pet is bitten by a snake that you think might be venomous, get medical attention immediately. It's better to go in and be checked out rather than wait and be sorry. Repellants and Removal Most wildlife experts believe there is no such thing as an effective snake repellant, although people have tried mothballs, vapor barriers, ultrasonics, sulfur, poison, etc. What can help is setting up physical barriers (e.g., fences that are set a foot or two into the ground), cutting off the snake's food supply and shelter, mowing closely around the house, storing firewood away from the house, removing junk piles, removing weeds and brush, plugging up holes in the ground, etc. And if you need to have dangerous snakes removed from your property, contact a wildlife control operator to trap and remove the snakes. This is not a job for an inexperienced person. Snake Identification: Venomous or Nonvenomous? Most nonvenomous snakes have a large smooth cap over the top of the head past the eyes, divided scales on the underside of the tail, no pits, and no long fangs. Rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths are all venomous pit vipers, and have a pit between and slightly below the eye and nostril. Pit vipers also have long movable fangs, a "cat's eye" pupil, undivided scales under the tail, and a large triangular-shaped head with a small shiny cap over the nose. Learn about the snakes in your area. Familiarize yourself with what the local snakes look like by reading through a field guide of reptiles and amphibians for your area. Compare the drawings and photos of the local venomous snakes with the non-venomous species so that you can remember what they look like, in general. A single species of snake may have a wide range of colors and patterns. Herpetology field guides can be purchased at book stores and science/nature stores, both off- and online. One online field guide iseNature. When you register (it's free) on the site, you can store your zip code, and access all the species (plants, invertebrates, mammals, lizards, etc.) found in your region or state, if the species is found throughout the state. Each species has a photo, written description, and locale. Kaplan believes everyone should have a herp field guide if they live where there are venomous snakes and poisonous amphibians because: People with pets or kids need to know what they are looking at and what their pets or kids may be about to poke at or pick up, says Kaplan. Preventive Options Training your Dog In areas where poisonous snakes are common, classes to teach dogs to avo snakes are usually offered. They teach a dog to keep out of harm's way by training him to recognize and avoid the smell, sight and sound of venomous snakes. These classes are effective. If you live in an area where rattlesnakes or other poisonous snakes are endemic, ask your veterinarian about these classes. VaccinationA snake-bite vaccine may be useful if you're in a part of the country that has lots of venomous snakes. One has been created by Red Rock Biologics. There have been no controlled studies on the effectiveness of the vaccine, but the vaccine may create protective antibodies that might be useful in neutralizing some of the injected venom. The vaccine may lessen the severity of signs if a dog is bitten. However, because there is so much variability in signs due to the different amounts of venom injected during bites, it can be difficult to determine if the vaccinated dog was helped by the vaccine or by the fact the snake injected little (or no) venom into the dog. Even if the dog has been vaccinated, he will still need to be examined by a veterinarian to determine just how much treatment will be necessary. Treatment Antivenin is a commercially produced serum that neutralizes the effects of injected venom. A specific antibody is needed for each type of snake, so knowing what kind of snake bite your pet is critical. Antivenin is extremely expensive and can have side effects in some individuals. Prognosis A significant factor in the outcome of a venomous snake bite is how much venom was injected, but there is no way to determine that amount. If the bite was dry, the animal will survive even though it was not vaccinated, given antivenin, etc. If the bite injected a large amount of venom, even a vaccinated dog given massive post-trauma treatment may not survive. However, we do know that quick action on the owner's part improves the prognosis. A venomous snake bite is a life-threatening emergency. Irreversible effects from venom begin immediately after the animal is bitten, so speed of treatment is critical. The size of the snake can sometimes indicate how much venom was injected, and the size of the snake relative to that of the pet is significant; pound for pound, smaller animals are more likely to have more problems because of the "dose of venom" per pound of their body weight. Your veterinarian's knowledge and experience will help determine the appropriate treatment for your pet. Snake-bite envenomization treatment is complicated, and your pet's well-being is best served by taking your bitten pet to your veterinarian as soon as possible.

Category: 10 Ways to Build Confidence in Shy and Fearful Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  Fear is a normal emotional response in dogs that can be from a real or perceived threat. Some dogs respond with subtle behaviors that seem shy, approaching with their head carried low, ears to the side or held flat, brow furrowed with a worried look, and eyes closed or blinking. Their mouth may seem tight, or they are licking their lips or yawning. Their tail may be lowered and slowly wagging. For other dogs, the fear is more obvious because they will hide, run away or freeze in place. These dogs often avoid eye contact and may tremble. Their tails are often tucked, and they may pant or stand completely still with their mouth closed tight and body tense. When cornered, these dogs may snap to get away and bark, charge, lunge, snap or bite. These behaviors are often misunderstood asaggression. Help shy and fearful dogs feel safer by building trust and teaching skills to manage their fear.     Try playing games in the yard, go for sniff walks in quiet and safe locations, or do nose work exercises (find hidden scents around the yard or house) instead.  These behaviors also give your dog a clear way to communicate with you when they are starting to feel overwhelmed and afraid.  When it comes to shy and fearful dogs, remember that these dogs will often show improvement over time once you become more predictable in your interactions with them and they learn the routine. Take note if your dog is not improving. Sometimes medication will still be needed to help your dog feel safe.

Category: Bite Levels in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One way to find out how serious a bite may be is to acknowledge that different levels of bites exist. Bite levels range from minor to so severe they lead to death. Dr. Ian Dunbar first developed this bite levels system and Dr. Sophia Yin created a modified description of the levels. Level 1 (pre-bite) The dog snaps or air bites but makes no contact with the person. People tend to say, “The dog tried to bite me but I moved away.” Humans have slow reactions compared to the speed of a biting dog and dogs have good aim when trying to grab things. If the dog actually meant to bite rather than warn, it would have succeeded. This air snap indicates there were earlier signs of the dog's displeasure or fear. Owners should get help before this pre-bite behavior progresses to an actual bite. Avoid punishing warning signs or the dog may progress to biting without warning. Instead, learn the signs of fear and anxiety that the dog probably showed prior to this situation and learn to spot the common inappropriate human actions that may have contributed to the snap. Level 2 (near-bite or highly inhibited bite) The dog snaps and makes tooth contact on skin but there’s no actual puncture. Often the dog runs up to or lunges for a person but just puts front teeth in contact with the skin in a sort of near-bite. In other cases, the dog actually opens his mouth and clamps but in an inhibited manner such that no skin is broken. Again the owners should ask, “What earlier signs did we miss to warn us that this could happen?” The owners should realize, the near-bite or inhibited bite could turn into a real bite down the road. Level 3A The dog bites once and punctures skin, but the puncture is shallower than the length of the canine tooth. Even though this bite may not be severe, it is still reportable. And painful, too. Reporting is mandatory if the victim is treated in a hospital. Once your dog has actually bitten at this level (or higher) he will always be considered a liability, even if, with behavior modification, he is 99.9% improved. Level 3B The dog bites multiple times leaving skin punctures shallower than half of the canine. Multiple bites generally mean the dog is in a higher arousal state. That is, the dog is reacting without thinking between bites. Level 4 The dog bites once with punctures deeper than the length of the canine (the dog bit and clamped down) or the bite produces slashes in both directions from the puncture which indicates that the dog bit and shook his head. This type of bite is very serious. While any of the lower bite levels should act as warning signs telling the owners to seek help from a qualified and educated behavioral modification specialist, the level 4 bite indicates this has been building up and you should have gotten help long ago. Level 4 bites are much harder than level 3 bites and show no inhibition in strength. A dog biting at this level presents a liability to the owners, both in terms of money and family members because this type of bite can kill a child. Level 5 The dog gives multiple bites with deep punctures. Dogs who bite at this level generally have had practice biting at levels 3 and 4. Some dogs are so fearful that a scary event triggers a high arousal state and they get stuck in a reactive mode, continuing to bite hard. Level 6 The dog kills the victim or consumes their flesh. It’s important to realize that even little dogs and puppies can bite hard enough to kill infants and small children. Dogs can bite this hard due to fear, but they can also bite and cause death due to over aroused play. What Should You Do If Your Dog Bites?Now that you know dogs can bite at different levels and early snapping and low-level bites can, and often do, lead to more severe bites, you can start addressing thebitingas soon as you see any low-level warning signs.

Category: Fireworks Fear in Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Summer is full of celebrations involving fireworks. Canada has Canada Day on July 1, the USA has Independence Day on July 4, and France has Bastille Day on July 14. Dogs and cats react to fireworks as individuals. Some aren’t upset by the explosions, and others get hurt by panicking and jumping through closed windows or bolting through doors to get away from the terrifying noise and lights. American pet advocacy groups point out that the number of escapees is so high that Independence Day is the busiest day of the year in shelters -- and that many pets get lost, injured, or killed. You should know which clinics or emergency hospitals will be open during fireworks season, in case you need one, as this will help you avoid time delays and stress. Your pets will do better if they are not left home alone during fireworks events. However, that's not always feasible, so think ahead before leaving them alone. Signs of anxiety can include pacing, trembling, panting, drooling, attention-seeking (vocalizing, pawing, nuzzling, and climbing on people), hiding, and bolting. Escape attempts tend to involve hiding behind furniture, and staying in a basement or bathroom. Because the source of the noise is confusing, inside dogs may want to escape to the outside, and outside dogs may be frantic to get inside. Nervous pets tend to drink more water, so keep more available than usual. (And remember, these summer events usually mean hotter weather and the likelihood of power problems, so extra water is already a good idea.) Bring outside pets inside so they can't bolt. Keep your cats securely inside, and if your dog needs a potty break during the fireworks, take him outside on a leash, even in a fenced yard. Make sure all your pets are wearing an ID tag or a collar that contains your phone number. Tags and collars can be lost, so a microchip is even more useful in helping you find your lost pet. Drug-Free Remedies What can you do to keep your frightened pet safe and calm? For many frightened pets, just staying in a crate (as long as they are used to one) or in a “safe” room with a closed door is all that's needed. Synthetic pheromone sprays such asFeliwayfor cats andAdaptil (formerly called D.A.P.)for dogs are available at pet stores. These sprays imitate the properties of the natural pheromones of the lactating female that give kittens or puppies a sense of well-being. An herbal relaxant calledComposurecomes in chews or liquid for dogs; the feline version is in chews. Some pets respond to pressure wraps, such asThundershirts. The pressure on the body may have a calming effect. Ear muffsto muffle sound are also available. Calming capscover a dog's eyes to reduce visual stimulation. If you can plan ahead for these summer events, veterinary behaviorists often recommend behavior modification, classical counter-conditioning, and teaching a desirable coping response. Inbehavior modification, controlling the intensity of the fireworks is necessary and often the most challenging part. While it often isn’t possible to expose a fearful dog to only “little fireworks,” controlling other factors can help. Distance from the fireworks can be less intimidating, as would be keeping the dog indoors.  Music may disguise the bursts of noise; consider loud music with a regular beat. Classical counter-conditioning can create a positive association with fireworks if the anxiety isn’t extreme. Give high-value food rewards (such as canned food or peanut butter as long as no one has any nut allergies), offer your pet his favorite toys or food puzzle toys, or have your pet practice his tricks with you. The goal is for him to learn that fireworks result in highly pleasant rewards. You can teach a desirable coping response. The appropriate response for a dog facing something frightening is to retreat to a safe place until the frightening thing ends. Providing a safe retreat, such as a crate or a closet, will give security and confidence, although selecting the location is up to the pet. Blankets to muffle the sound and a pheromone diffuser will provide natural motivation for the dog to seek this location. Being able to cope when the world becomes overwhelming is a life skill essential for both people and dogs!  Hiding is not a sign of a problem if the pet quickly returns to normal behavior when the fireworks are over. Medication It's easier to prevent a fearful reaction than it is to reverse one. If your pet is nervous around loud, unexpected noises, a short-term sedative before the fireworks start may be just the ticket. Talk to your veterinarian ahead of time so you can have something on hand to give your pet before the noise begins. Several medications are used for fireworks or thunderstorm phobias in dogs; however,do not use any of your own prescriptionsbecause the dosage may be potentially harmful. Some severely anxious pets may benefit from drugs (clomipramine,fluoxetine, ortrazodone) that increase the level of serotonin. Trazodone may start working within a few hours, but its effect varies, so you should test it with your dog before the fireworks season starts. The other drugs can take several weeks if not more, to build up to an effective level, so they are not a spur-of-the-moment fix. You have many choices for helping your pet cope with fireworks stress. Talk to your veterinarian about what is best for your pet. Hopefully, everyone in the family will then be able to enjoy the holiday!

Category: PTSD Can Occur in Companion Animals after Disasters
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dogs and cats who survive disasters can suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder in the same way as their owners and for the same reasons: being placed in an environment that is unpredictable and they are unable to control.  While counseling is available for human disaster victims, the signs of anxiety and/or distress shown by their animal companions can be missed or even inadvertently ignored initially as their owners try to come to terms with what has happened to them and their environment.  The behavior issues may therefore have exacerbated by the time veterinary help is sought. After a disaster, pets may be left behind, or they may be taken with their owners to an evacuation centre or a friend’s home, or be separated from their owners and taken to a safe place such as a kennel or foster home. When the situation becomes more normal (which may take days, weeks or even months) and they are reunited with their owners in their home or temporary accommodation, owners may notice changes in their pet’s behavior that indicate that the pet is anxious or stressed. Behavioural changes may include loss of housetraining in dogs or elimination outside the litter box in cats; barking or vocalizing more than usual for no reason that is apparent to the owner; hiding; avoidance behaviors; and sometimes irritability and aggression. They may show a decrease or loss of appetite, may show less interest in interacting with their owners, or become very attention seeking and will not leave the owners alone and follow them everywhere (“Velcro pets”). These signs can be nonspecific so consulting veterinarians should be aware that any changes to normal behavior could indicate an anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress. Advice that veterinarians can give to owners: If the dog or cat continues to show signs of possible stress or anxiety, a thorough physical examination is important to rule out any medical issues that may be contributing to the problem. Many animals may also have physical (organic) diseases that may have developed as a result of or incidental to the stress and anxiety of the trauma that the pet and the owner have experienced. Never punish a pet for showing signs of anxiety as that may actually increase the anxiety, and it is very likely to exacerbate the problem as it does not help the pet learn how to behave. Treatment And Management The veterinarian presented with such a case needs to determine the support needed by the pet and by the owner. Owners should always be encouraged to go to support agencies that are available in disasters. If the owner expects life to get back to normal within a relatively short period of time, benzodiazepines (e.g.,diazepamoralprazolam) could be prescribed; these have the effect of reducing signs of anxiety and also have a useful amnesiac effect.  On no account shouldacetylpromazine(ACP or ace) be considered! This may make the animals more noise sensitive with potentially no way to escape noises and without behavior modification the pet has no other coping strategies. If the dislocation is likely to be long term, the owner should be counseled on the relative advantages of keeping the animal with them, long-term boarding or even fostering in a more stable environment with family and friends.  Medication with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (or SSRI, e.g.,fluoxetine) or a tricyclic antidepressant (or TCA, such asclomipramine) may be necessary for some animals. Some medications may take up to two months to reach therapeutic levels so ideally complete blood work and biochemistry panel should be performed prior to prescribing medication. If medication is prescribed, owners should be aware that medication may be required for at least 6 to 8 months and medication should always be withdrawn slowly under veterinary supervision. Some pets may need medication for prolonged periods, even for the life of the pet, and this should be explained to owners in advance. If long-term medication appears to be advisable, a behavior modification program is essential and will be therapeutic for the pet as well as the owner. Behavior modification is an area that not all veterinarians are comfortable performing. Discuss with your veterinarian whether referral to a veterinary behaviorist would be best for you and your pet.

Category: Puppies and Kittens Who Bite
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bringing home a new puppy or kitten can be a fun and exciting experience. However, the learning and development process for puppies and kittens can be challenging. Biting is a common issue for young pets and needs to be addressed properly. Why Do Puppies and Kittens Bite? Biting, in which a dog or cat actively and purposefully bites down with their teeth (although not necessarily to break skin) is a common behavior in puppies and kittens. Mouthing, which is a general term for dogs or cats that put their mouths/teeth on people and other pets, sometimes in a chewing manner, sometimes in a nipping manner, is also common in puppies and kittens and tends to occur for the same reasons as biting. Biting and mouthing are normal behaviors in young, developing dogs and cats and are rarely associated with aggression. Reasons for biting include: Consequences of Biting Biting and mouthing may be normal for puppies and kittens, but continuing to bite into adulthood can lead to issues. Normally, young animals learn to stop biting during play when their mother and siblings correct them with yelps or distancing themselves. When siblings and parents are not available to teach a little one how to behave in the family, human owners must step in. Long-term consequences of biting vary depending on the cause. For example, biting out of fear, frustration, or to avoid something can teach bad habits if not prevented. When biting achieves the desired result of getting a human to stop an action (such as biting while having nails trimmed), the youngster could potentially learn that biting to get what he wants as an adult is acceptable. The same goes for biting because of attention seeking. If a puppy or kitten is mouthy as a means to get you to play with them and give them attention, rewarding this behavior with any kind of attention (to some pets, even corrections are attention) could mean continued mouthing or attention seeking behaviors as an adult. Even mouthing because of teething can lead to bad habits and continued mouthing well beyond the onset of adult teeth if not corrected. Regardless of why a youngster bites, biting should never be encouraged because it can lead to continued biting into adulthood, and as adults dogs and cats that bite can inflict serious damage and/or result in a poorer quality of life for themselves and their owners. How to Manage Biting Below are some suggestions for discouraging and preventing biting and mouthing. Remember that this is a learning process for everyone and that some suggestions will not be as effective as others depending on the reason for biting, such as play biting vs fear/avoidance. Punishment for Biting Donotpunish a puppy or kitten for biting. Punishment, especially for a normal behavior, can prevent a puppy or kitten from learning normal skills like play biting to hone hunting skills. It can also affect the bond between the pet and humans and may even lead to fear, aggression, and/or anxiety.Punishment does not serve to teach an appropriate behavior.The best solution is to stay consistent with your training methods and be patient. Use management tools that encourage better actions and provide good outlets to meet the needs of both you and your young pet.

Category: When Excitement Causes Your Dog to Tinkle: Conflict (Submissive) and Excitement Urination
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Does your dog suddenly lose control of their bladder when you get home?Orwhen you lean over to pet them, or while greeting visitors? This behavior may be excitement or conflict urination. Since any disease process that affects the kidneys and bladder, such as a urinary tract infection, bladder stones, orectopic ureters,can make it difficult for some dogs to control their bladder, these conditions must be ruled out first. Bloodwork, diagnostic imaging (radiographs and ultrasound), anda urinalysis to look for infections, crystals, and urine concentration abilityhelp determine if certain types of liver or endocrine diseasesareplaying a role in this behavior. Once all medical causes have been ruled out, it is time to consider a primary behavioral cause,such as incomplete house training, conflict urination (submissive urination is the older term), or excitement elimination (urination). Each of these behaviors has a different cause butistreated in a similar fashion.Incomplete housetrainingrequires going back to the basics,whileconflict and excitement urination will have a different management and treatment plan. Regardless of the cause, punishment isoften counterproductive and never the solution. Conflict urination, motivated by both fear and anxiety, often results when your dog wants to interact with you but isn’t sure you are always safe. This conflict triggers spontaneous, non-conscious urination that can occur during greetings or other direct interactions with you. With this behavior, dogs oftenroll on their back(a conflict behavior) before urinating,while jumping or even standing in place. Regardless, your dog doesn’t feel safe if this type of urination occurs. To keep your dog feelingsafeduring greetings, never reach for or loom over your dog.Avoid prolonged eye contactor speaking sternly.Never force your dog on their back or physically punish them in any way. Instead,greetyour dog on their level and invite them into your personal space rather than invading theirs. Instead of reaching over their head, try scratching under their chin. Keep these interactions low-key and always use a calm, soothing, andgentle voice instead of a stern orhigh-pitchedone. The key to changing this behavior starts by making all greetings more predictable for your dog. Consistency and predictability are key. Change up greetings by teaching your dog tostationon a waterproof mat or step up onto a platform. Asking your dog to pick up a toy or using a well-known cue liketouchto earn a rewardgivesopportunities to redirect your dog easily but alsoencouragesinteractions in a less threatening, moredog-friendlymanner. Unlike conflict urination, excitement urinationtends to occur when your dog becomes overly enthusiastic during greetings. Punishment usuallyis notthe cause ofthis behavior, and often, the urination occurs while the dog is wiggling in place or running towards you to say hello. This behavior has more to do with an overflowing bladder rather than a negative emotional state. To change this behavior, be sure tosupplyplenty of opportunities throughout the day for your dog to empty their bladder. This may mean asking for favors from friends and family members or hiring a dog walker to make sure your dog has plenty of opportunities to eliminate throughout the day. The first step to reduce this behavior is changingyour greeting ritual. The goal is to reduce overstimulation and excitement. Keep a jar of treats or a toy box handy near the door,anddon’t ignore your dog. Ignoring can result in anxiety and frustration. Instead,toss a few treatsor your dog’s favoritetoyswhile you are walking through the door. Calmness is key,and playing games such ascapture desirable behaviorshelpsteach your dog how to remain calm while building up alistof low-key behaviors that can be offeredwhen greeting your dog. Useasafe haven,which may be a room or an area behind a gate. Place your dog here before visitors arrive,but ensure they haveplenty oftimeto eliminate beforehand. Once your visitors enter the home and have settled,let your dog out for low-key greetings, including cueing touch, tossingtreats, or fetch with a toy.Conditioning relaxation on a mathelps your dog learn how to stay calm and relax around distractions,including visitors and in new environments. Conflict and excitement urination can be frustrating, but it is important to remember that your dog isn’t doing this out of anger or spite. They just can’t consciously control their bladder.In the case ofexcitement urination,the good news ismost will outgrow the behavior as they get older. That usually isn’t the case with conflict urination. The mosteffectiveway to reduce this type of urination is to avoid punishment, encourage calmness, and change greeting rituals. If the behavior is not improving or spontaneously appears, seek help from your veterinarian. There may be an underlying medical reason why the behavior is not getting better.

Category: Enrichment for Senior Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Samantha Zurlinden, Veterinary Student Class of 2023Reviewed by the Veterinary Team at VIN What is Enrichment and Why is it Important for Senior Dogs? Enrichment is offering experiences and opportunities to animals to encourage healthy natural behaviors and enhance physical and emotional welfare. Enrichment is often broken into two broad categories: environmental and social.  Environmental enrichment alters the animal’s space either by making changes to the environment itself or by adding novel items such as toys, feeding puzzles, exercise, and things to smell and explore. Social enrichment involves offering positive social experiences for the animal with people or other animals. Enrichment is important for all species of animals, including people! Sometimes we enrich our lives and our animal’s life without even noticing, such as going for walks outside or eating a yummy treat. Sometimes enrichment takes planning, such as a vacation or assembling food puzzles for your dog. Understand that what is considered enrichment should be from your dog’s perspective and each dog needs to be able to choose if they want to participate or interact with the enrichment item or not. We can entice dogs to participate by offering their favorite treats or petting in their favorite spots but ultimately it will still be their choice to interact or not. Dogs can have several age-related diseases that can result in behavior changes and welfare concerns, such as arthritis, dental disease, cancer, diabetes, and other endocrine diseases. Additionally, dogs can develop canine cognitive dysfunction, a syndrome that is similar to Alzheimer’s disease in humans.  Pain is more likely to occur in senior dogs with age-related diseases, leading to decreased activity, increased anxiety, restlessness, and occasionally aggression. Due to these age-related challenges, we should find ways to enrich their lives and help manage these conditions. While senior dogs may not be able to participate in much physical enrichment, such as long walks, other forms can be mentally stimulating and tiring. If you have noticed behavioral changes in your senior dog, work with your veterinarian to determine if there is an underlying medical condition that may be causing the behavior. You should also discuss your dog’s weight and nutrition with your veterinarian to keep them at a healthy weight and as comfortable as possible. By working with your veterinarian to manage age-related health conditions and providing individual and age-appropriate enrichment, you can enhance your pet’s quality of life and improve your bond with your aging dog. Enrichment Ideas for Senior Dogs When it comes to enrichment, you can find something for all senior dogs no matter what their health or mobility status.

Category: Nighttime Waking in Senior Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Sleep is essential for dogs and people. Disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle occur in older pets and often disrupt the entire family. Interrupted sleep is a common problem in older pets and may occur for many reasons, including both medical and anxiety-related causes. Diagnosis and Clinical Signs There are many reasons an older dog may have difficulty sleeping at night. Dogs do getcognitive dysfunction, which is similar to dementia in people.  The hallmarks of these syndromes are progressive confusion, reversal of day-night wake-sleep patterns, and poor adaptability to new situations. Just like older people with early-stage dementia, the dog may function well in routine and familiar situations but be confused in new situations.Waking at night may occur for reasons other than cognitive dysfunction, such as pain or discomfort. Dogs who are feeling discomfort may pace, pant, vocalize, or be restless at night but may not show any physical limitations during the day. The effects of pain or sore muscles may be more noticeable to the dog at night. The urge to eliminate may wake many dogs. Senior pets are more likely to have medical conditions that would increase the pet's urination or defecation frequency or decrease control of these bodily functions. Many physical and medical conditions should be considered, including urinary tract infections, kidney disease, hormone imbalances,Cushing's Syndrome, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, and neurological impairments. Anxiety can cause nighttime waking. Dogs may be anxious because of weather-related noises such as thunderstorms or noises in the home from people or other animals.  The dog may also be anxious during the day but the severity is often increased at night since these noises are more pronounced and start when it is quiet. Furthermore, the dog's reaction may be limited to restlessness or pacing, which is often not noticed during the day. Seizures may occur anytime but often seizures that occur at night are not seen by the family, so people are awakened by a dog in a confused state. Thinking about the pattern of when the dog wakes can help figure out the cause and at least partially correct the problem. Some dogs have difficulty settling down or falling asleep while other dogs may go to sleep easily and then wake up in the middle of the night. Some dogs go to sleep, enjoy slumber much of the night, and then wake up early. A definitive diagnosis may be difficult because there are so many medical conditions to consider. Cognitive dysfunction is only diagnosed with certainty in the later stages, and there is no test for it. Management After evaluating possible medical causes, try to establish a predictable routine for nighttime slumber. The pet's routine as a younger dog may provide some insight into his preferences but consider age-related changes. An older dog may require an orthopedic bed to ease pressure on bones and joints. Warmth may also be important as the dog may not be able to regulate body temperature and cold weather may affect sensitive joints.  Establish a bedtime routine that may include a late trip outside for elimination, a massage, and quiet time settling in a comfortable area. Most dogs prefer to be with family members but some prefer to rest alone. Quiet, soothing music may obscure sounds and a night light may help a dog with vision problems to walk in dark hallways with more ease. Even though this condition may be frustrating, avoid punishing or scolding. After addressing your dog's physical needs, try gently and calmly returning your dog to where he likes to sleep. Some dogs want to sleep in bed with people; this is a matter of personal preference and family tolerance. Unless it is unsafe due to aggression, it is acceptable for dogs to sleep with people. Be sure to consider if this pattern of slumber with canine companions will continue to be acceptable since once they have tried it, many dogs like to sleep on comfortable mattresses with comforters. Despite commonly perpetuated myths, this type of "spoiling" does not cause other behavior problems; it does, however, teach a dog it is nice to sleep in a person's bed. Nutraceutical and Pheromone Interventions Cognitive dysfunction is a slow, degenerative, and progressive disorder. Supplements are available that may ease the severity and slow its course. Ask your veterinarian about diets designed for the unique needs of senior pets. Some of them provide antioxidants (vitamins C and E, beta carotene, selenium, flavonoids, and carotenoids) that may reduce the neurological damage caused by free radicals and fatty acids as well as dl-alpha-lipoic diet and l-carnitine. Others include botanic oils such as medium chain triglycerides (MCT's) that provide an alternative energy source. These diets are shown to improve a senior dog's performance on cognition tests. Dietary supplements that contain phosphatidyl serine, ginkgo biloba, and grape extract (resveratrol) are likely to slow and minimize cognitive impairment.S-adenosyl-l-methionine, or SAMe, may reduce anxiety and increase awareness and activity in the senior dog. Furthermore, SAMe is safe or even beneficial for patients with compromised liver function. These supplements are most beneficial in the early stages of cognitive decline. A dog-appeasing pheromone (such asAdaptil)may ease anxiety and promote a feeling of well-being. The diffuser may be especially useful to create an area and support the use of a desired area for resting. The collar is most useful for dogs who experience anxiety all the time. Melatonin may help create a normal nighttime sleeping cycle. This supplement should be given at bedtime on a regular basis. Combined with a predictable nighttime routine, it can help create a normal sleep pattern. Pharmacological Treatments Sometimes medications may be helpful to induce sleep. Benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety medications) such asdiazepam (Valium),alprazolam (Xanax), or oxazepam (Serax).Trazodonemay also be helpful. These medications are relatively quick-acting but don't last long so administration must be timed carefully. Medication should be combined with other recommendations described above.Generalized anxiety may be reduced with medications such as SSRI's or TCA's but these medications require many weeks before positive effects are seen.  Cognitive dysfunction symptoms may be reduced withselegiline (Anipryl), which when given in the morning may help to keep the dog more alert and active during the daytime. Old age onset of anxiety may reflect the additive effect of lifelong learning or be a sign of progressive decline from cognitive dysfunction. Expected Outcome Nighttime waking may be caused by medical or behavioral changes common in senior dogs. Often these problems may be managed and good sleeping patterns can be re-established, though many of the underlying conditions may be persistent and worsen with age. Quick intervention is important since undesirable habits may form quickly and people may become frustrated when they're sleep deprived.

Category: Behavior and the Senior Dog
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Introduction Dogs are living longer these days than ever before due to advanced veterinary care and better nutrition. However, as they get older, age-related diseases such asarthritis, dental disease, diabetes,Cushing’s disease,thyroid disease, cancer, and decreases in vision and hearing can all result in subtle or more obvious behavioral changes in dogs. These changes can include decreased activity, loss of appetite, and even aggression. What about Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CCDS)? Similar to Alzheimer’s disease in humans, another disease to consider in older dogs iscanine cognitive dysfunction syndrome(CCDS). This disease affects the brain, causing behavioral changes such as disorientation, decreased social interactions, vocalization, increased restlessness at night, house soiling, anxiety, irritability, and, in some cases, agitation. We may think of cognitive decline as an “old dog” disease, but clinical signs can start to emerge as early as 5 years of age in some dogs, especially larger breeds. Clinical Signs of CCDS D:DisorientationI:Changes in social interactionS:Changes in sleep-wakeH:House soilingA:Changes in activity level and anxiety Determining the Cause When determining the cause for behavioral changes in older dogs, we must first rule out underlying medical diseases withlab testssuch as a complete blood count, serum chemistry, thyroid profile, and urinalysis.  Diagnostics such as radiographs can show signs of arthritis or certain types of cancers. Specific exams to look at teeth, eyes, and even the nervous system can also help narrow down the cause. Cognitive disease is often diagnosed based on behavioral signs alone once other medical causes have been ruled out. Treatment The goal for these dogs is to improve their welfare rather than to cure. Pain is often a common factor resulting in decreased activity, increased anxiety, restlessness, and in some cases even aggression.Anti-inflammatories(NSAIDs) and other pain medications often improve the dog’s comfort level and subsequent quality of life.Behavioral supplements, pheromones, prescription diets, and anti-anxiety medications may also be helpful. In addition to medications, enrichment using interactive food dispensing or puzzle toys can provide mental stimulation, sharpen problem-solving skills, and exercise the brain. Using a variety of new smells hidden around the house or in the yard often stimulates interest and physical activity. Positive reinforcement trainingis another form of enrichment for older dogs, can be used when teaching new tricks or playing memory games. This training helps to sharpen your dog’s memory while providing positive human interactions. Many of these techniques can be just as mentally tiring as if you just took your final exam for chemistry. They can also help your dog sleep better at night and slow down the progression of canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome in some dogs. If you are observing behavior changes in your older dog, a trip to the veterinarian is encouraged. What you are seeing may not just be your dog slowing down. There may be more to the picture than meets the eye or assuming that’s the way it goes; you may be able to significantly enhance your dog’s quality of life in their senior years.

Category: Body Language of Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Body language in dogs is all about communication. Since dogs can’t form words, they use body language to “talk.” This includes different body postures, facial expressions, movements, and types of barks. These communication behaviors are used to respond to their surroundings, convey messages about ongoing situations, or to respond to someone else’s body language. A dog’s body language is often instinctive and happens naturally, such as trying to settle down a tense environment through actions or responding to an invitation to play. This form of communication can be used between dogs, during dog and human interactions, or between dogs and other animals. Knowing what your dog is communicating can help you understand his needs better and keep him comfortable in any given situation. Below are some common types of body language that dogs use. It is important to recognize that many of these types of body language can mean different things in different settings and should be used in context of whatever is happening in the moment. A common example of this is panting, which could mean “I am nervous,” or “Gosh, it’s hot out,” or even “I’m tired.” Diffusive Behaviors These are types of body languages that dogs use to avoid conflict, help diffuse a potentially intense or threatening situation, and keep interactions from getting out of hand. Some refer to these behaviors as calming signals because, in a way, they signal to others such sentiments as “everything is ok,” “things have gotten a little too tense,” or “I am not a threat.” That being said, these types of behaviors indicate more than just calming; they communicate both how the dog is feeling and her ability to react and interact with others. Be aware that some of these behaviors can be misinterpreted as signs of guilt, such as the slow, creeping walk towards or away from you when you correct your dog for doing something wrong. This behavior does not mean your dog is acting guilty for getting into the trash. It means she is trying to diffuse the situation and lessen the intensity of your correction. She honestly may have no clue at all why you are upset with her, and she just wants you to stop yelling. Happy/Relaxed Anxiety/Fear/Worry Assertiveness and Aggression These types of body language behaviors may occur in a dog attempting to use diffusive behavior that has been ignored, or may occur without initial signals such as in an overly excited/worked up or aggressive dog on high alert. Dogs that are too worked up or excited are said to be highly aroused. Assertive or aggressive posturing can frequently be seen in dogs exhibiting these body languages. Often the more aroused the dog, the more intensely she will respond to perceived threats or issues in the environment. A Note about Snapping and Biting Bites have different degrees of severity, but a bite is still a bite even if skin is not broken. A dog may snap at something without making contact; this is generally the dog’s effort at communicating a more intense warning. In this case, anxiety, fear, or aggression have been occurring and the signals have gone unnoticed. It is important to understand that generally, the dog is the one who has decided not to make contact or cause harm. Dogs are fast and can bite hard when they feel it is necessary, so take this warning snap seriously. When an actual bite occurs, again, degrees of severity exist. Dogs can bite without drawing blood, bite superficially, or in more highly aroused states, give multiple and/or deep bites. Bites that occur without drawing blood are likely inhibited by the dog, meaning she held herself back from inflicting damage. It is important to understand that these bites and other superficial ones are still bites without major harm. They are likely to result in worse bites in the future if the dog doesn’t receive the help needed to move past the cause for the biting. Multiple and/or deep bites, those with no inhibition from the dog, means the dog bit without thought, acting on reaction alone.  Any snaps or bites require prompt assessment and assistance for the behavior issue. Resources Below are some excellent resources to read or watch. Sometimes watching the behaviors in a video makes more sense than reading about them.

Category: Food Finicky Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If your dog has always been a picky eater, there is likely no need for concern. The main thing to consider is if his attitude toward food has changed. If your finicky eater maintains a healthy weight, if he is alert/perky, and has a shiny coat, that is one thing. If he was a good eater, but has suddenly stopped, that’s different. That could mean something has changed with his regular food. (Is it spoiled? Does it smell odd? Does it look different?) Or it could mean that something is wrong with him, physically or emotionally. If he has lost weight, is sluggish, has developed gastrointestinal problems (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), tooth problems, or mouth sores, then you should have your veterinarian check him out. Even joint pain can make your dog reluctant to walk to his bowl to eat. Some dogs seem to live to eat - dinnertime is an important part of their day - and some just eat to live. This attitude can vary by breed and by the way they were taught to think about food. If your dog grew up with you offering multiple kinds of food, that may have trained him to hold out for something better, just like children will hold out for ice cream, instead of Brussel sprouts. If you’re constantly coaxing your dog to eat, then your dog has trained you to keep offering tastier and tastier items. You may think your dog wants or needs a variety of foods, but he doesn’t. Your dog can eat the same food every day as long as it’s nutritionally correct. Sometimes, the picky eater’s problem is that he doesn’t like the brand of food you’re giving him, or that he prefers a different texture (canned food instead of dry or vice versa). The more you keep offering table scraps, treats, gravy, cookies, etc., the more you’re risking creating a picky eater – and one that will become obese. So if your dog is picky because he was “trained” to be, how can you correct this? You can teach him to understand that he doesn’t have options. Sometimes, as part of treating your pet’s health issues, you may have to change your dog’s diet. The trick is to do it gradually. With some effort and time, which may be longer than you envision, you can help your dog if the reason he's not eating well is purely behavior. Visit your veterinarian to see if there is any medical reason that can be treated so that his normal appetite will return.

Translating Return to English Jumping on People 101covered the long-term plan for working with a unruly attention-seeking jumper, but what if you encounter a friendly dog jumping on you right now? If your situation is a big dog jumping up on people, you need first aid! Here are some ways to cope today until training can take full effect. Please note that none of these techniques are enough to teach the dog not to jump on people in general, and none of them will apply to all dogs. Because dogs, people, and situations vary so much, these are options, but you'll have to decide which ones you can use in a particular situation. Remember, don'tencouragesomeone else's dog to jump on you! It’s usually unwise, though, to attempt to train someone else's dog to stop jumping on people. Teaching this properly is a fairly long process that needs to be integrated into the dog's life as a whole. Remember that when you attempt quick fix punishment-based training with someone else's dog who is trying to be friendly to you (which is, after all, what jumping up on people means), you risk causing problems for that dog and owner in how the dog will relate to people in the future.

Category: Jumping Up on People by Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English How many dogs have been relegated to back-yard living because they jump all over family and guests whenever anyone walks through the door? Then when someone goes out to visit the lonesome dog, the jumping is worse because the dog is even more excited to see someone. Only now the dog is dirty, too. Not good! Let's talk about how to solve this problem once and for all. We humans encourage dogs to jump on us by petting them, starting in puppyhood, when they stand on their hind legs to get closer to our loving face and hands. This normal unruly behavior is most likely attention-seeking in nature when it's not accompanied by aggression. They don't mean anything bad byjumping up, but very few people like being jumped on by a dog. As the dog gets older and stronger, he may scratch people and knock people down. It's not only children and elderly people, but bigger, stronger dogs can potentially knock adults down as well. The behavior becomes a way to get your attention, even you start pushing them off and telling them 'No.' The person may see this as a punishment, but your dog may not see it as aversive at all. When a dog is still a very young puppy, the best way to handle jumping up is never to allow the puppy to even start doing it. Don't let anyone pet your cute little tootsie of a puppy unless all four feet are on the ground. If you teach your puppy that all petting happens when four feet are on the ground, your big dog will not be jumping on people. Instead, the dog will develop sweet ways of greeting people such as laying a head lovingly against your knee. This training is harder than it sounds because dogs are usually rewarded by someone for this behavior, and chances are you have an adolescent or adult dog who is jumping on people. What do you do now? It's the same principle as with the puppy, only it will take longer. Attack this problem on more than one front. Here are the ingredients for training your dog to greet with four on the floor: People can be inconsistent about ignoring undesirable behavior and rewarding good behavior, so you may have to choose who your dog interacts with. If even one person encourages jumping, she will continue to perform the behavior. Come Cuddle One good way to teach your dog to greet without jumping is a simple cue to go to the person's knees. Start by putting your open hands, palms facing outward, on the front of your knees. You'll be bending forward to get your hands here. Tell your dog 'come cuddle', and your dog will likely be drawn to your inviting hands. Pet your dog. Do the 'come cuddle' practice over a few sessions until the dog responds quickly. Then find someone else to help you, have them take the position, point to them, and tell your dog to 'go cuddle'. Have them encourage the dog verbally to come to them, and give petting when the dog arrives. Then you call the dog to 'come cuddle' to your hands at your knees. Do a few repetitions back and forth, stopping before the dog gets bored. Repeat this, and soon you'll find when you say 'go cuddle', your dog will aim for a person's knees even if their hands are not there. Prompt the person to lean down and pet the dog at knee level - be firm with people that they must not ruin your training by inviting your dog to jump up on them! A Note about Little Dogs You may not mind your small dog jumping up on you, but give this some thought. You're not going to want the dog to spoil someone's clothing by clawing at their legs. Also, a little dog jumping and expecting to be caught can be injured if the person misses. Safety Many of us see no reason to teach our dogs not to jump up. We don't mind, and if a friend or relative needs the dog not to jump, we simply put the dog on leash. We get older, though, and our dogs age even faster than we do. Besides age, many physical problems can arise that make jumping up downright dangerous. At some point in your dog's life, jumping will become a hazard to her. Your dog will live with less risk of pain if taught early on not to jump. The non-jumping dog's life will include more petting and love, because it's so much easier and more enjoyable to pet a dog who has four feet on the ground.

Category: Kids and Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many parents mistakenly think a child-friendly dog means the dog should tolerate anything a child does. Although kids and dogs can, and often do, have great relationships, it may not be as easy as it seems. Children are unpredictable because they make loud noises and move suddenly, causing even the most mild-mannered dog to become frightened and overwhelmed. Any dog, even one who loves kids, can bite if they feel threatened, especially if they can’t escape the situation. Research shows that kids are most often bitten by a dog they know. In these situations, adults may not be watching or believe their dog would bite. Inappropriate Interactions Parents should actively monitor interactions between children and dogs for potentially dangerous situations. When interacting with your dog, do not allow children to: Prevention Adults should actively engage with the children and dogs. When direct supervision is not possible, separate the dogs and children using barriers. Provide your dog with their own space. This should be a closed room or secure crate with everything your dog needs. Baby gates can be used to set up this safe haven. Teach your dog to love their special place and teach the children to never approach when the dog is resting there. Learn Your Dog’s Language Children are more at risk of dog bites because they haven’t been taught how to read a dog’s body language and can’t assess the danger. Dogs will often displaysubtle signsof discomfort, such as yawning and avoiding eye contact, before escalating to more obvious signs such as growling. By watching for these signs, you can step in to safely manage the situation by guiding your dog away from the child. If ignored or punished, then your dog is more likely to bite “out of the blue”. Teach your children to recognize your dog’s body language by using children’s books, videos, and coloring pages. Adults still need to manage all child/dog interactions. Structured Interactions Show children appropriate ways to interact with dogs so they can be safe. Structured, predictable interactions between dogs and children can build positive relationships. With adult supervision, the following activities are appropriate for children with dogs who have never shown aggression: Fetch -Using two or more toys, older children can play fetch without needing to take toys away from the dog. The child tosses the first toy and when the dog returns, they toss the next toy. Flirt pole -For dogs who love to chase, attach a plush toy to a rope and stick that your child can hold. Using the flirt pole the same way you would a cat wand, let the dog chase the toy. Always finish the game with a treat. Training -Involving kids with the dog’s training can help create a strong, positive bond between them. Start training sessions with cues the dog already knows, like “sit”. Tossing treats or kibble -Another simple but effective game is to have kids toss either treats or kibble across the room for the dog. Teach your child to freeze in place if your dog starts chasing or jumping at them. More movement or noise from children will encourage the dog to continue. If you have taught recall or “touch”, call your dog to you. If your dog does not come when called, they should be leashed. Visitors Visitors can mean more excitement and activity in the house. Visiting children may have little experience or be overly comfortable with dogs, leading to inappropriate interactions. Even kid-savvy dogs may be uncomfortable sharing their home and space, leading to a growl or bite. When visitors with children come over, use the dog’s safe haven, and keep them away from the excitement. Avoid Punishment When creating happy, peaceful relationships between children and dogs, punishment is never appropriate. In scary situations, punishing a frightened dog can ruin relationships and doesn’t change the underlying issue. Safety is the priority when managing relationships between dogs and children. If you are having a hard time creating positive interactions or your dog has shown aggression, contact abehavior professionalfor assistance.

Category: Understanding Your Dog’s Body Language
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Observing, understanding, and respecting body language is essential to strengthen and maintain the relationship with your dog. By understanding their needs, you can provide the best care and know when your dog is comfortable in a situation. Accurately interpreting body language can help you live safely with dogs and avoid behavior problems that could harm your relationship. By watching your dog, you will see them use their body position, ears, eyes, tail, lips, and vocalizations to communicate with you and the world around them. Relaxed Dog Body Language A relaxed dog has “loose” body language. Their ears may be in a neutral position or forward if attentive and alert. Their eyes should be soft, not fixed on a particular object or staring. Their tail will be in a neutral position or wagging widely from side to side. Their mouth will look relaxed, not clenched or tense. Attentive Dog Body Language An attentive, alert dog holds their ears forward and upright. Evaluate your dog’s entire body since their ears are only a part of the picture. Your dog could be attentive and in a positive emotional state during a training session with forward ears and an upright tail. Instead, they could be hypervigilant to an approaching stranger with ears forward, looking around quickly and assessing their surroundings. A tucked tail may indicate anxiety. They may have a front paw lifted while deciding whether to move toward something or away from something. They may be watching a squirrel with their ears forward, eyes focused and staring, the tail up and only wagging slightly at the tip. Their hair may be standing along the midline of their back indicating a state of attentiveness. Fearful Dog Body Language If subtle signs of fear and anxiety are recognized and addressed early, obvious signs of fear and aggression can be avoided.  If ignored, their body language may escalate because the dog learns their previous subtle signs are not effective, causing behavior problems and safety concerns. Subtle fearful signs include lip licking, facial tensing, hair raising especially along the midline of the back, ears positioned backward and flattened, and eyes wide open. They may avoid eye contact and the tail may be tucked under the dog’s body. A Final Note About Respecting Body Language Consider safety first when signs of fear, anxiety, or aggression are seen. Punishment is not a humane or effective strategy and could potentially worsen the behavior problem. If you need help with managing these situations, work with a qualified behavior professional.

Category: Understanding Your Dog’s Body Language
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Body language in dogs is all about communication. Since dogs can’t form words, they use body language to “talk” to us. This includes different body postures, facial expressions, movements, and types of barks. These communication behaviors are used to respond to their surroundings, convey messages about ongoing situations, or to respond to someone else’s body language. A dog’s body language is often instinctive and happens naturally, such as trying to settle down a tense environment through actions or responding to an invitation to play. This form of communication can be used between dogs, during dog and human interactions, or between dogs and other animals. Knowing what your dog is communicating can help you understand his needs better and keep him comfortable in any given situation. Below are some common types of body language that dogs use. It is important to recognize that many of these types of body language can mean different things in different settings and should be used in context of whatever is happening in the moment. A common example of this is panting, which could mean “I am nervous,” or “Gosh, it’s hot out,” or even “I’m tired.” Diffusive Behaviors These are types of body languages that dogs use to avoid conflict, help diffuse a potentially intense or threatening situation, and keep interactions from getting out of hand. Some refer to these behaviors as calming signals because, in a way, they signal to others things like “everything is ok,” “things have gotten a little too tense,” or “I am not a threat.” That being said, these types of behaviors indicate more than just calming; they communicate both how the dog is feeling and her ability to react and interact with others. Be aware that some of these behaviors can be misinterpreted as signs of guilt, such as the slow, creeping walk towards or away from you when you correct your dog for doing something wrong. This behavior does not mean your dog is acting guilty for getting into the trash. It means she is trying to diffuse the situation and lessen the intensity of your correction. She honestly may have no clue at all why you are upset with her, and she just wants you to stop yelling. Happy/Relaxed Anxiety/Fear/Worry Assertiveness and AggressionThese types of body language behaviors may occur in a dog attempting to use diffusive behavior that has been ignored, or may occur without initial signals such as in an overly excited/worked up or aggressive dog on high alert. Dogs that are too worked up or excited are said to be highly aroused. Assertive or aggressive posturing can frequently be seen in dogs exhibiting these body languages. Often the more aroused the dog, the more intensely she will respond to perceived threats or issues in the environment. A Note about Snapping and Biting Bites have different degrees of severity, but a bite is still a bite, even if skin is not broken. A dog may snap at something without making contact; this is generally the dog’s effort at communicating a more intense warning. In this case, anxiety, fear, or aggression have been occurring and the signals have gone unnoticed. It is important to understand that generally, the dog is the one who has decided not to make contact or cause harm. Dogs are fast and can bite hard when they feel it is necessary, so take this warning snap seriously. When an actual bite occurs, again, degrees of severity exist. Dogs can bite without drawing blood, bite superficially, or in more highly aroused states, give multiple and/or deep bites. Bites that occur without drawing blood are likely inhibited by the dog, meaning she held herself back from inflicting damage. It is important to understand that these bites and other superficial ones are still bites without major harm. They are likely to result in worse bites in the future if the dog doesn’t receive the help needed to move past the cause for the biting. Multiple and/or deep bites, those with no inhibition from the dog, means the dog bit without thought, acting on reaction alone.  Any snaps or bites require prompt assessment and assistance for the behavior issue. Behavior changes in dogs can be blatant or subtle, although they are generally easier to read than cats. To learn more, see achart of dog body languagefrom Dr. Sophia Yin.

Category: What is "Littermate Syndrome"?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is “Littermate Syndrome”? Also known as littermate dependency, this term refers to behaviors that develop when two puppies from the same litter are raised together. Behaviors include attachment to each other, difficulty bonding with humans and other animals, aggression, separation anxiety, and reduced independence in training. This pattern is believed to occur with any pair of puppies or dogs that are raised together at the same time, whether they are siblings or not. The concept of littermate syndrome is a topic of discussion among dog trainers, shelter personnel, breeders, and other animal professionals. However, this syndrome is not recognized by veterinary behaviorists or other leading experts in the field. Instead, the behaviors associated with this “syndrome” are more likely related to the challenges of raising two puppies together. If this “syndrome” isn’t real, why do these behaviors occur? In general, raising one puppy can be time-consuming. Teaching social skills, housetraining, socialization, management, and training is challenging enough with just one puppy - imagine doing all of this with two. When working with two puppies, it is difficult to ensure that each puppy has their own unique experiences independent of the other. Socialization During thesocialization period, puppies learn about new things in their environment, the human world, other animals, and so much more. The quality of each new experience is important. Each puppy needs to feel safe and is given ample time to explore and make associations at their own pace in a positive yet controlled manner. Housetraining Housetraining is an essential aspect of raising a puppy. It involves teaching puppies to eliminate in designated areas and develop good bathroom habits. With direct supervision, positive reinforcement, frequent opportunities to eliminate, an established routine, and a little patience, most puppies catch on quickly, but not all. Each puppy will be different, and therefore two puppies going through the housetraining process at the same time may be frustrating for all. Redirecting Less Desirable Behaviors Puppies will chew, nip, jump, and demonstrate other nuisance behaviors. Redirection is often key, and “puppy proofing” is essential. Enrichment in the form of food-stuffed puzzle toys, adequate exercise, rest periods, and positive reinforcement training can reduce all of these behaviors and help puppies make better choices.Capturing desired behaviorhelps to build healthy bonds with humans and gives the puppy opportunities to reinforce the behaviors you want to see from your dog. Attempting this with two puppies can lead to missed opportunities or accidental reinforcement of undesirable behaviors. Training Training is an important form of learning for both the human and the puppy. This process gives an opportunity for mental enrichment and to teach basic social skills. Behaviors such as“touch”,“come”when called, and how to“settle on a mat”are all important skills for all puppies to learn.Leash mannersand learning how to like car rides are equally important. When accomplishing these tasks, working with two puppies will be twice the challenge. Is there ever a time when two puppies may be better than one? Yes. Some puppies raised together may form healthy bonds and develop well-adjusted behaviors. If you do choose to raise two puppies together, provide each puppy with separate training, socialization opportunities, and individual attention to promote their overall well-being and balanced growth. When it comes to littermate syndrome, it is not so much about a lack of bonding with the family or behavioral problems developing when puppies are siblings. It is more about the challenges that come from raising two dogs together simultaneously.

Category: Adopting a Shelter Dog
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Deciding to add a new animal to your family is an exciting time! It can be very rewarding to choose to adopt a dog or puppy from an animal shelter or rescue program. Not only will you be adding a wonderful companion to your family, but you will also be saving a life. There are still millions of shelter animals being euthanized annually in the United States that would have made wonderful family pets. Here are a few things to consider before, during, and after the adoption that can help ensure success. Before Adopting Make sure you’re ready Adopting an animal means that you are agreeing to be responsible for the animal’s care for many years to come. It is always smart to think ahead and consider what might change in your life and how you will be able to ensure that you meet your new dog’s needs as a beloved family member. Veterinary care, nutritional needs, exercise requirements, and how well the dog will blend with children and other family members are all important considerations. Research what type of dog is right for you and your familyMany factors may play into the type of dog you seek to adopt. Breed, energy level, sociability, haircoat, age, your personality, and lifestyle are just a few. Many shelters are experienced at helping to make lasting matches and may even have standardized, research-backed questionnaires for you to fill out to help with this process. Learn about your local shelters and rescuesMost areas have more than one animal welfare organization and each may have different missions and philosophies. You may wish to give your adoption support to the agency your philosophies align with the best. Consider asking your regular veterinarian about the local shelters. Chances are, they’ve examined animals from most of the nearby facilities. They will have opinions about the health and well-being of newly adopted animals and about shelter operations. It can also be useful to ask friends what their experiences have been. Ultimately, you should not only feel great about the dog or puppy you are bringing home, but also about the organization you choose to support through your adoption. There are many things to learn about and consider! During the Adoption What to expectRescues and shelters take variable approaches to the adoption process. Some require you to fill out involved questionnaires and will call landlords and perform reference checks. Others take a more open, trusting, and conversational approach. Some shelters will send animals home the first day you visit and others take a slower approach.It can be helpful to familiarize yourselfright awaywith how the shelter you visit works so you won't be disappointed after you've matched with a dog. Almost all shelters will require their animals to be spayed/neutered before adoption. Many shelters will have already performed the surgery before animals are made available for adoption, while others wait until adoption papers have been signed. This is also something you may want to find out about early on. Less commonly, shelters will send animals home with a voucher or other system and require spay/neuter at some point after adoption. It can be helpful to try to keep an open and compassionate mind during the adoption process. Remember that shelters are busy and chaotic places not only for the animals they house but also for the humans that work there. What to askOnce you have found a dog that you are interested in, ask the shelter for as much information as can be provided! Get a complete history, but recognize that sometimes there is not much information known. Find out when and where the shelter obtained the dog; was it brought in as a stray, surrendered by an owner, transferred from another shelter, or in some other situation? Ask what is known about the previous living situation and how the dog has behaved since being at the shelter. You should also be shown the medical records the shelter has kept since intake (and any previous records that might exist). You will want to ask about any ongoing medical issues, whether the dog is on any medication, and if there are known medical issues what anticipated care will be required. Inquire about what sort of follow-up services the shelter offers such as health insurance, microchipping, obedience training, or consulting for behavioral issues or medical issues. Finally, be sure to ask about return policies as it is important to know what options exist if the adoption does not work out. After the Adoption Veterinary visitAlthough many sheltering organizations have staff veterinarians, many do not. The level of veterinary care can be advanced to non-existent. No matter what exists in the shelter your dog comes home from, it is always wise to schedule an appointment to see your regular veterinarian soon after adoption. Illnesses such as upper respiratory infection and diarrhea are quite common in the early period after adoption due to the stress of shelter stays, and your veterinarian can help provide appropriate care so that your new friend recovers optimally. Vaccination boosters, parasite examinations, microchip implantation, and other important preventive care may also be needed during the early time after arriving home. Be patientIt can take weeks for a new dog to adjust to a new home, yard, family, and environment. Keeping things quiet for a week or so, learning about and employingcrate training, and establishing a solid routine can help. Especially for an older dog, patience during the initial adjustment period, andoffering enrichment(opportunities to play, learn and explore new things) often pays off in spades once the dog settles in! Use your Community Resources Finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help if things aren’t perfect initially or if you have questions. The shelter you adopted from will ideally be your first source of information and happy to hear from you and to provide support!

Category: Introducing the Dog to Your New Baby
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bringing home your new baby, particularly your first one, can lead to many new changes and stressors within the household. Dogs don’t always know how to handle changes like this. Remember that many family dogs haven’t spent much time around babies, even if they’ve enjoyed playing with children. Conditioning them and preparing them for such a new and different creature in their lives is important for your well-being and comfort as well as the dog’s. Before the baby’s arrival, get a check-up for your dog and update vaccinations. This will ensure he is healthy or allow you to address any problems before bringing the baby home. If your pet is a naturally anxious dog or has ever shown any signs of aggression, this check-up will be a great time to discuss your concerns with the veterinarian. Begin desensitizing your dog to things that may occur with a baby. This can include touching your pet’s ears, feet, and tail and ensuring he is comfortable with people around his toys, food bowl, and water bowl.  It will be helpful to ensure he is capable of basic commands such as “sit,” “drop it” or “leave it,” and “stay.” These commands give your dog the opportunity to get rewarded and will serve as a nice distraction if he starts to show anxiety or overactive behavior around the baby. Make sure to positively reward your dog for good behavior and performing commands correctly. Any changes you plan to make once the baby comes, such as removing your dog from the bedroom at night or keeping your dog off the couch, need to happenwell beforethe baby arrives.  You don’t want the dog to associate the new baby with the frustration or scariness of big changes like new sleeping arrangements. The same goes for schedule changes. If your dog is used to be fed promptly at 5 p.m. every evening followed by a daily walk, this schedule will likely change with a new baby. Begin varying his schedule a little so he is better able to adjust to timing changes. It may be helpful to play lullabies, white noise, and baby sounds (including crying) around your dog. These sounds can be found online. They don’t have to be loud, but helping your pet get used to such sounds in a gradual manner can help him adjust to all the new sounds he will likely experience with a new baby. If you notice that these sounds make your pet anxious at any point, stop and re-introduce the noises at a lower level and in a more gradual manner. Always give plenty of treats and praise to ensure these sounds are associated with positivity. Let your dog sniff and check out any new baby gear. This includes strollers, car seats, cribs, etc. Take your pet on walks with an empty baby carrier so he gets comfortable with it. Have your pet ride in the car in his normal spot, or the one he’ll be moved to, with the empty car seat set up.  Offer treats and praise throughout the process to ensure a positive association. Before your dog meets the new baby, let him smell the baby’s used blankets or clothing so he gets used to the new smells. Ideally, this should be done before the baby actually comes home. When you do bring the baby home, first greet your dog without the baby. He will have missed you and this will give him a chance to greet you and settle down. He will also be able to smell the baby on you and it can prepare him for his first meeting. Have one person in charge of the baby and the other in charge of the dog to help manage their first interaction. Everyone should stay calm and relaxed. If your pet seems anxious, calmly walk away with him. Do not punish or yell at him if he seems anxious or uncomfortable. Play with your dog and distract him before trying again so he relaxes. Remember to use commands and rewards to help keep him calm. Your new baby and your dog will need to be supervised together for all interactions. A dog that is comfortable with an immobile baby may become anxious when the babe begins to crawl. A curious baby is not going to understand that pulling a dog’s ears or poking him in the eye is inappropriate (although as the child gets older, this needs to be addressed). Any situation that arises in which your dog seems anxious or shows any signs of aggression should not be ignored. Handle these situations calmly, separate your dog from your baby (or vice versa) when needed, and discuss the situation with your vet. Be mindful of all the new changes and challenges that your child and dog will be experiencing together. Remember to be patient and remain calm. Voice any and all concerns about your pet’s health and behavior with your veterinarian to ensure he is handling the wonderful but hectic time of adding a new member to the family.

Category: Barking Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Your dog is barking what feels like day and night, but why? Dogs bark to alert everyone around them of something new or worrisome. Although you may not see the squirrel or another dog, there could be something that you cannot smell, see, or hear that they can. A barking dog might be undesirable to you - and your neighbors - but understand that this behavior is not excessive to your dog. It is nearly impossible to keep your dog from barking completely because this is how they communicate. Nonetheless, when barking becomes excessive, it could result in complaints from your neighbors or distress for you. Dogs bark for many reasons. Some bark in warning, others to greet. Some are uncertain about something new, whereas others are afraid or anxious. Dogs often bark when excited or for attention. Certain breeds, such as Beagles and Shelties, were bred to bark for hunting purposes or to alert humans of predators, like birds, in the area of their flocks. How do we stopbarking? Start by identifying why your dog is barking. It is useful to journal the times of day and what is in the environment during barking episodes. Teaching alternative behaviors incompatible with barking, like checking in with their person or relaxing on a mat can be helpful to change this behavior. It is important to use positive reinforcement when teaching these behaviors, meaning a reward is given for each desired behavior. A reward does not have to be a treat. Learn what your dog likes. Some rewards include a favorite toy, attention, or verbal praise.  Force or pain, including yelling, painful collars, and physical punishment, are often not helpful. These techniques and devices can increase anxiety, causing the barking to get worse rather than better. Another way to decrease barking is to make sure your dog has opportunities to exercise their brain and body. This doesn’t mean taking mile-long walks or runs unless they are sniff walks through the neighborhood, woods, or fields. Sniffing is a great way to burn calories and enrich the mind about the world around them. Playing nose-work games and introducing your dog to food dispensing andpuzzle toysare great ways to exercise your dog’s mind and keep your dog busy throughout the day. When your dog barks in response to some stimuli, such as someone walking by with another dog outside or the doorbell ringing, it’s helpful to teach your dog togo to a matwhere they have learned to be quiet. Basically, you train your dog to go to a specific rug or place and reward them when they are calm and not barking, no matter what else is going on. Remote treat dispensers can easily help you reward your dog for being in place with a click of the remote. Excessive outdoor barking is likely the most common source of neighbor complaints. If your dog barks too much while outside, you need to go out and bring the dog in. It is important not to leave your dog outside unsupervised. Instead, call them to you and bring them inside right away. You may need to keep your dog on a long leash to achieve this. You don’t want them practicing and perfecting their barking behaviors. Should your dog bark for attention, make sure you are reinforcing your dog for other behaviors, such as touch oreye contactbefore giving them the attention they want. If you need help, certified professionals are an option. Whenchoosing one, you want to look for specific things. Ask for references from both friends and family. Your veterinarian might also have suggestions for professionals in the area. First, credentials are important. Anyone can label themselves as a dog trainer, so ask for proof. Ask where they received their training and what they are certified in. Secondly, confirm that they only use positive reinforcement. Ask directly if they use shock, choke, or prong collars. Training methods that inflict pain on your dog are punishment, not the positive reinforcement methods recommended here and by veterinary behaviorists. Thirdly, make sure the program is the right duration of time. A relationship cannot be built between your dog, you, and your trainer overnight. Realize that training will take a significant amount of time and effort so that the results will last beyond the program length. Training classes and trainers don’t teach your dog so much as they teach you to train your dog, so you must do the work. Regardless of whether you use a certified professional or work on your own, remember that it will take time because barking is a natural behavior that you can shape but not eliminate. This work is a learning opportunity for both you and your dog that will help build a stronger, more understanding relationship. Stay patient and optimistic!

For busy dogs, reinforce for lying quietly on their bed. To reduce barking, reward for silence as your dog watches someone walk by your house. To stop begging at the dinner table, treat your dog for choosing to lie on a mat several feet away.   Following this simple game captures the “good” behavior while ignoring the “bad".  By not prompting your dog to do a specific behavior, such as sit or down, you create a thinking dog, and as the days go by, they will start to offer only reinforced behaviors. After a few days, your dog will offer the desired behaviors faster than the undesired ones. You should find your dog to be calmer and your relationship stronger as you go through your kibble supply more quickly each day.

Category: Conditioning Your Dog to Nail Trims
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Teaching your dog to be calm and comfortable with the nail trimming process is necessary for your pet’s well-being. Your dog needs to hold still as their feet and nails are manipulated. The procedure can be painful if the nails are trimmed too short or if your dog struggles during physical restraint. Untrimmed toenails can break or tear, causing pain or infection. Trimmed nails help to contribute to healthy body movement. Lay a Positive Foundation in Puppyhood Food treats distract puppies and help keep them still without restraint. Lickable treats such as squeezable cheese, canned food, or peanut butter spread on a spatula or table are helpful. Trim one or two nails daily so your puppy enjoys short training sessions. If they become stressed, stop and try again later with higher-value treats. Routine trimming is not an emergency and forcing your dog’s compliance may cause long-term resistance to foot and toe handling. Change the Emotion to Change the Behavior Classical conditioning can be used to change your dog’s emotional state from neutral or negative to positive by rewarding each step with a tasty treat. Ideally, your puppy will learn to expect a yummy treat at the sight of the trimmers. The process should proceed at your dog’s pace and they should remain relaxed. It may take several sessions to change their emotional response. Each nail trim step should occur right before the treat is delivered and the treat is given regardless of your dog’s reaction. They do not need to offer a paw or other behavior, to earn the treat. Rushing the training may cause your dog to become fearful, and then they may associate treats with a negative experience. They will then avoid the treats and nail trims. Observe your dog’s body language for subtle indications of stress or fear. When working with a partner during the conditioning process, one person can carry out each step while the other delivers the treat. Clear communication and proper timing are important. If your dog is given the treat too soon, they will not connect the handling to the treat. Your dog should be aware of each step, then rewarded before continuing. Operant conditioning gives your dog an opportunity to offer their cooperation. They can be taught to sit, lift a front paw, place the paw in your hand and hold it still. No restraint is necessary as the dog elects to participate. Positive reinforcement training methods should be used. If punishment methods such as pushing, grabbing, pinching, yelling, collar corrections, or shock are used, then fear and anxiety will be associated with nail trimming. Your veterinarian may suggest both classical and operant conditioning for home practice and clinic nail trim visits. A referral to a positive reinforcement trainer or board-certified veterinary behaviorist may be made. If your dog needs a nail trim before being fully trained, sedation can be used to prevent further stress. Daily supplements and medications may be prescribed to lessen a dog’s anxiety before nail trims. Nails should be kept short for your dog’s health and wellness. Classical and operant conditioning are techniques to ensure successful nail trims. With patience and low stress handling, nail trims can become routine for every dog.

Category: Desensitizing Your Dog to a Muzzle
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Why use a muzzle? Comfortably wearing a muzzle is a great skill for any dog to have. Chances are it will be necessary to wear one at some point during their life. The veterinary hospital is the most common place a muzzle may be needed. Some veterinary procedures are painful and having a dog who is comfortable wearing a muzzle is beneficial. Acute abdominal pain, trauma (such as a broken leg), or back pain are examples of issues an owner may encounter at home with their dog that can be extremely painful. Any dog has the potential to bite and pain can make that more likely. Muzzles can also provide greater freedom for many dogs. Muzzles should never be viewed as punishment, and we can often help dogs learn to ask to wear their muzzle. Historically, muzzles have been associated with aggressive or biting dogs. There was a stigma attached to muzzles that suggested people using them were not kind to their dog. Muzzles can also be used to prevent dogs from ingesting inappropriate items such as discarded food, corncobs, dead animals, food wrappers, and bark mulch. These items can cause GI upset or obstructions and may require expensive and invasive surgeries. There are basket muzzles specially designed for this purpose. Many dogs are fearful and fear increases the risk of biting. This danger often leads to an isolated life and makes it difficult for owners to give their dog enough enrichment and exercise. By teaching a dog to wear a muzzle, you can safely work on behavior modification while allowing your dog to be around other dogs and people. A bonus for the dog that does not want to be approached by unfamiliar people is that the average person does not want to approach a dog wearing a basket muzzle. What kind of muzzle is best? There are different kinds of muzzles. For short procedures at a veterinary clinic, a sleeve muzzle may be used. This type of muzzle prevents a dog from opening their mouth, which makes it difficult to pant, drink water, or eat treats. A basket muzzle allows the dog to pant, take treats, and drink but reduces potential injuries from a bite. There are many different styles of basket muzzles, including custom fit muzzles that may be needed for those dogs with wide or flat faces. Desensitization/Counterconditioning steps Desensitization starts with a muzzle, tasty treats, and a quiet environment. There are four main parts to this process: introducing the muzzle, increasing the time the dog’s face is in the muzzle, attaching the straps, and then increasing activity while wearing the muzzle. Step 1: Introducing your Dog to the Muzzle  Step 2: Increasing Time of Your Dog’s Nose in the Muzzle  Step 3: Introducing the straps Step 4: Make it fun  If your dog seems to be having a difficult time with any of these steps, back up to a step they seemed more confident with and reinforce before moving on to the next step. To make the muzzle look more fun and less intimidating, decorate it! Some fun options are to use decorative tape or to glue colorful gems to it. You could decorate your dog’s muzzle to match your favorite sports team’s colors. Your dog won’t care what the muzzle looks like, but bright colors create a different association for the people around your dog.

Category: Dog is Having Accidents in the House, But Why?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Revised 8/1/2020 by Ashley L Elzerman, DVM, DACVB from previous versions of Veterinary Partner articles by Meredith Stepita, DVM, DACVB and Laurie Bergman, DVM, DACVB  When your dog has an accident in the house, it is easy to believe the dog is acting out of spite or some other defiant motive, but he’s not. There can be medical causes or behavioral causes for eliminating in the house.  There can also be a lack of housetraining or a loss of house training.Getting to the root of the problem will make sure your dog gets proper treatment and the best chance for success. Medical Causes When a previously housetrained dog begins to have accidents in the house, the first thing to do is to rule out medical causes. Any medical condition that causes increased frequency, urgency, or volume in urine or stool can lead to house soiling.  Having your dog evaluated by your veterinarian is a good idea. Your veterinarian may recommend specific testing, such as fecal, urine, and blood tests, based on your dog’s specific problems and the results of the dog’s physical exam.  In most cases, housetraining problems from these causes can be solved or improved by treating the medical condition and if needed, completing a quick housetraining refresher. Behavioral Causes Once medical causes have been ruled out or treated, consider behavioral causes of house soiling. Some causes to consider include improper cleaning of previous accidents, scolding for elimination, fear of the relief area, marking, anxiety, or early learning. Housetraining Refresher Once the cause of the problem is identified, re-establish the habit of eliminating outside by taking your dog through a housetraining refresher. The steps in housetraining: Thus, if your adult dog is house soiling, the first step to take is to have your veterinarian check him over for physical illnesses and evaluate for behavioral causes. Next, put him in a housetraining refresher course. This refresher will improve or fix the problem most of the time. If he is still house soiling, there may be more complicated reasons for this change in behavior. Contact your veterinarian or a veterinary behaviorist to diagnose and treat these more involved behaviors.

Category: Dog Training: How to Use Rewards
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The article,Dog Training Using Rewards: Why, covered why positive reinforcement training is so beneficial and important for you and your dog.  The second part covers some of the basics in how to get started in reward-based training and some of the concepts behind this training.  The basics work with any animal, including people, but the details may have to change depending on who you’re training.  For example, most dogs work well for liver in many different forms: liverwurst, freeze-dried liver, cooked liver.  But for many people, liver is not at all rewarding and a better choice would be chocolate. Rewards and Reinforcers In theory you can use anything your dog likes as a reward.  Food is the easiest reward to use in most training situations.  Some dogs are motivated to work for access to a favorite toy, especially the chance to tug with someone.  Other things like belly rubs or the chance to snuggle on the sofa may not be practical in all situations, such as when you’re out on a walk or riding in the car.  Petting can be distracting, turning a training session into a petting session can interrupt what you are teaching your dog.  Save rewards like petting or snuggling for behaviors your dog already knows, not when you’re teaching something new. The best way to train a new behavior is throughcontinuous reinforcement.This means you need to reward (reinforce) your dog each and every time he chooses to do the right thing.  That’s why the small, low calorie treats are so important. Once your dog is 80-90% reliably performing the new behavior, you can switch tointermittent reinforcement.This means you become like a slot machine.  He never knows when he will hit the jackpot so he keeps working to get the “win.” Rewards must be given immediately.Timing is crucial.  Remember to only reinforce the behaviors you desire.  For example, if you wait a little too long to reward your dog for staying, he may get frustrated and bark.  If you give the reward after the bark, you just taught your dog to bark for the things he wants. Because we can’t always have a food reward available the instant we need one, it helps topair food with a sound.This sound can be praise or a simple word like “Yes” or “Good” or a clicker.  The sound becomes a bridge (promise) letting the dog know that a treat is on the way. Troubleshooting Reward Based Training How do I get him to do what I want in the first place?Rewarding your dog for doing the right thing means giving him the opportunity to offer the behaviors that you want to reward.  There are three basic ways to do this. I know he knows it but he won’t do it. Dogs are smart but they don’t always think the way we humans do.  There can be several reasons why a dog isn’t “obeying” a person.  We have to look at things from the dog’s perspective to problem solve what may be going on. People get frustrated if training isn’t going perfectly and start to look for quick fixes.  This frustration often leads them to try punishment-based options or so-called “balanced trainers” who use rewards to teach a behavior followed by punishment later in the training process.  There’s a growing body of research showing us that dogs trained via positive reinforcement versus punishment-based training methods (especially using shock collars) are happier and less anxious during training.  This is true whether they are learning something new or practicing cues they already know.  Learning occurs more efficiently with reward-based training than other methods.  Physically punishing an anxious or unsure animal can lead to aggression. Simple Keys to Success Keep it fun:If you and your dog aren’t enjoying the training session, go back to simple things that he already knows so you can have success or just take a break from training altogether.  Always train with a happy, upbeat voice and relaxed body language to signal to your dog that this is something fun. Watch what your dog is telling you:If you see signs that your dog is getting anxious or frustrated, change the situation.  Do more simple training or move away from what’s making him anxious.  Early signs of anxiety include ears held back, tail down or tucked, eyes darting around or seeing the whites of his eyes, hunched posture, panting when not hot, taking treats more slowly, as well as responding slowly to cues he knows well. Set realistic goals:Don’t try to do too much at once.  Keep training sessions short so they stay fun.  Break down what you want to teach into smaller pieces to make it more manageable.  For example, to teach a dog to lie down on a dog bed while you eat dinner you need to teach him to go to the bed, to get onto the bed, to lie down on the bed and to stay on the bed.  Teaching him to stay on the bed involves starting with just a couple of seconds and gradually building up the duration.  It also involves teaching him to stay there while you move further away from him and take your focus off of him. Be consistent:It’s hard to learn something new if the rules are constantly changing or you keep getting different instructions.  Make sure everyone who is training your dog uses the same cues (words, hand signals) and knows how to give rewards, especially the importance of giving rewards immediately when teaching something new. Make yourself look great:If you want to look like the best trainer in the world, take something cute your dog naturally does and put it on cue.  For example, if your dog rolls on his back when you take his harness off after a walk, mark that behavior and give him a reward.  When you take off his harness say, “Roll” then reward the roll.  Pretty soon you can show off this trick to your friends.  One of my small dogs would stand on her back legs to check things out.   I gave it a name and rewarded it.  She really impressed people when I would ask her “What does a Meerkat do?” and she’s stand right up. Reward-based training isn’t just good for your dog.  Once you and your dog get the hang of it, it’s also fun and quite easy.  It really is a gift that keeps on giving.

Category: Dog Training: Why to Use Rewards
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Animals ranging from flatworms and dogs to dolphins and people can learn to perform different behaviors based upon consequences. Doing something either makes them feel good or feel bad. For example, a chimp learns to push a stick into a termite mound because when she pulls it out it is covered with termites to eat; a cat may learn to stay away from a stove because it hurt when he touched a hot burner. Why Reward-Based Training? With positive reinforcement — having something good happen when the animal does what you want — your dog can learn basic behaviors such as “sit,” “lie down,” “stay,” or even more complicated tricks, like rolling over, spinning or waving. You can train for a competition like agility or a job like search and rescue, or just for fun. With reward-based training, you can train both on-leash and off-leash. Teaching your dog new things using rewards improves the dog’s mood, builds self-confidence, and opens a new path of communication strengthening the human-animal bond. You may hear people say that reward-based training is “bribing the dog,” that reward-based trainers don’t know how to say, “No,” or set limits. Some people feel dogs should do things just to please people, not for rewards. Not true. Giving a dog a reward for doing something isn’t bribery, it’s payment for doing the “job” you asked him to do. The rewards are most often food, especially something extra delicious, but for some dogs the opportunity to play with a special toy can be highly motivating. Petting can be a reward for some dogs but it’s hard to use in when teaching new things because it can be very distracting. Dogs think in the “here and now” so the dog needs to get his reward immediately. Their brains can’t understand waiting until the end of the week to get a paycheck. You may like being praised by your boss, but getting your paycheck is what motivates you to go to work every day. Same thing for your dog; he enjoys it when you praise him and talk nicely to him, but if he’s doing a difficult job, like sitting still on a walk when he sees another dog, he needs that paycheck! (SeeDog Training Using Rewards: How To) Why Not Use Punishments? People may get frustrated when training isn’t going perfectly and start to look for quick fixes and often turn to punishment-based options.

Category: Dog Walking Tools
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Collars, harnesses and leashes are all used to help control dogs, mainly when they are out of their homes. Even a well-trained, friendly dog needs to learn to be comfortable on-leash as does the dog who “never leaves home” because every dog has to leave sometime. Collars Flat/Basic CollarsThe most basic type of collar is just a circle, usually of fabric or leather, that is adjusted to fit around a dog’s neck and buckles on and off. Once adjusted the size of the circle doesn’t change if the dog or person pulls on the collar. It should be adjusted so two fingers can slip under the collar. On most dogs this fitting will allow the dog to comfortably wear the collar without being able to slip out of it. These collars work well for holding a dog’s id or rabies tags but are not great for walking dogs. Without training, these basic collars do little to help control a dog who is pulling or lunging, despite putting pressure on the dog’s trachea and other vital structures in his neck if he does pull or lunge. Dogs with narrow faces can slip out of these collars if the person walking them is trying to pull the dog’s leash from in front. Martingale /Greyhound/Limited Slip CollarsThese collars are similar to a basic collar in their function with one difference. A Martingale collar has a small additional loop that tightens slightly if the leash is pulled on. This extra loop prevents dogs from being able to back out of the collars. However, like a basic collar, without training, they do not provide much assistance if a dog pulls or lunges. Choke/Slip/Training Chains/CollarsThese collars, often made of metal chain links, tighten when pulled. The only thing that limits how small the circle is on these collars is how tight it can be pulled around the dog’s neck. Without proper training and use, these collars do little to stop dogs from pulling or lunging despite choking the dog. These collars are used as part of correction- (punishment) based training. They can be quite difficult to use correctly. The collar must be appropriately fitted and placed on the dog. As with other punishment-based training, the handler’s timing must be excellent when delivering “corrections” (quickly and firmly tightening the collar around the dog’s neck). Using punishment on behaviors that have a fear or anxiety component can often increase the dog’s fear/anxiety and may make the dog more anxious, and symptoms of that anxiety, including aggression, can get worse. There are limited slip collars that, as the name suggests, limit how much the collar can slip or tighten. Some of these are intended to function as Martingale collars, preventing the dog from being able to back out of the collar. Others are intended to be used like choke collars with the handler tugging the leash to give “corrections.” Prong CollarsLike choke chains, these are usually metal collars that tighten around a dog’s neck. There are plastic versions that act in the same way. These collars are limited in how much they can tighten, unlike the choke chain. Instead they work by pressing prongs into the dog’s skin all around the dog’s neck as the collar tightens. Often people are told to use a prong collar because their dog pulls on leash or is reactive (lunges) when on leash. Many of these dogs are pulling or reactive because they are anxious. While the prong collar may decrease these behaviors, it often doesn’t. Even if the behaviors are decreased the underlying cause for them, the dog’s anxiety, isn’t decreased and may escalate due to the painful sensation of being grabbed and poked all around his neck when he pulls. This anxiety can be further heightened if the handler is actively using the prong collar to give “corrections” (quick jerks or “pops” with the collar to cause it to tighten) because of the difficulties in using any punishment-based training correctly, especially one that uses physical discomfort. There are some dogs who do learn quickly (within just a couple of walks) that pulling on the leash will be uncomfortable while wearing a prong collar without their owners giving corrections. These dogs learn to walk calmly. In general, these dogs are friendly, not anxious or reactive and are often pulling because they want to walk faster than their handlers or prefer another direction. If the dog shows no signs of discomfort or anxiety on walks, this collar may be an acceptable tool. However, there are more humane ways to teach a dog to walk nicely on leash. These dogs tend to respond well to positive reinforcement’s loose-leash training. Head Collars/Head HaltersHead collars/halters have the basic design of two connected loops, one around the dog’s snout and the other behind her ears. The leash attaches under her chin. It’s similar to using a halter to walk a horse. This design gives the handler the best physical control because you have control over the dog’s head. Head collars are not used to give “corrections.” They are designed to reduce pulling and lunging without the handler having to actively apply force. Although it may be somewhat unpleasant for dogs to pull against a head collar, it is rare to see an increase in anxiety or aggression with their use if the dog is properly acclimated to the collar. Most dogs will need a slow introduction because it is new and you want your dog to like whatever he has to wear. Collars and InjuriesAny collar can potentially cause injury, especially if used incorrectly. The chances for injuries and the types seen with flat collars, Martingale collars, choke collars and prong collars are greater than with head collars. These can range from increased pressure in eyes, injuries to the dog’s throat, trachea, nerves, and blood vessels in the neck and spinal cord. If you are using a flat collar, a Martingale collar or a limited slip collar, you can reduce some risk for injury and pain by using a wider collar to distribute the force more evenly. Flat collars and Martingale collars are not typically used as training tools. They function to keep dogs “attached” to people with leashes. Electronic training collars, especially those that deliver electric shocks (or “stimulation”) deserve special mention. As with any training technique that relies on a person applying an aversive (painful, unpleasant) stimulus they are difficult to use correctly. Because of the difficulties in using them correctly, electronic training collars can escalate anxiety in dogs, resulting in fearful or aggressive behaviors. When used incorrectly or if the collar malfunctions, in addition to the psychological pain the dog suffers, physical injuries including burns and skin punctures by the electrodes can occur. Although physical injuries are less likely with collars that deliver vibration, ultrasonic sounds, or citronella sprays they can occur. These collars can also cause increased anxiety and damage the bond between pet and owner. Body Harnesses There are two basic designs to body harnesses: harnesses that simply provide places to attach a leash, and those that are a little restrictive if dogs pull. Neither type of harness is intended to be used in a way that the handler actively “corrects” the dog. Harnesses don’t put pressure on the dog’s trachea or nearby blood vessels. This makes harnesses safer to use than collars in dogs with collapsing tracheas, neck injuries, or eye diseases like glaucoma. Harnesses that Don’t Restrict PullingJust like a sled dog’s harness, properly fitted harnesses on which leashes are clipped onto the top or near the back distribute the force when a dog pulls. This distribution means that the dog isn’t choked, and the harness isn’t digging in and causing any discomfort. There are several different designs for this sort of harness, including step-in harnesses that can be helpful with dogs who aren’t comfortable about having their legs handled or people reaching under them, and can even teach them to pull. These harnesses are best for dogs who already walk well on leash. The even distribution of force can lead to some dogs pulling more because they aren’t bothered by how it feels when they do. Front Attach HarnessesThese harnesses have an attachment for the leash on a strap that runs across the dog’s chest, just above the legs. Some have a second attachment point on a strap that runs over the top of the dog’s back, just behind the shoulders. Similar to head collars, these harnesses work by controlling the dog’s front end. The idea is that If the dog pulls, the pressure will turn him back towards the handler. There are some concerns that these harnesses, especially if dogs continue to pull, can cause shoulder injuries and change the way a dog walks. Leashes/Leads At its most basic, a leash is a thing that attaches the dog to the person. There are lots of ways to improve on this basic design, but let’s we look at some common designs and what to avoid. Basic LeashesMost leashes are made up of a combination of the leash itself, a handle and a clip to attach the leash to the dog. For general dog walking, whether in an urban or suburban area or just going into your veterinarian’s office, keep the leash 6 feet or less. It should be a material that’s comfortable on your hands. The buckle should be secure enough that it won’t open or break if your dog does suddenly pull, but light enough that it doesn’t weigh the dog down, a problem sometimes seen with small dogs. For leash chewers, there are a few options. One is a leash made of a metal chain. These tend to be heavy and uncomfortable in the person’s hands and can damage the dog’s teeth. There are also leashes made from plastic-covered metal cables. These are stiff and difficult to handle and can also be bad for the dog’s teeth. Instead, look for leashes made of heavy-duty rope like climber’s rope or double layers of nylon. While they are not “chew proof,” these leashes will stand up to chewing while you teach your dog other ways to behave on-leash Handle VarietiesThe most basic leash has a simple loop at one end to slip over (not wrap around) your wrist or fingers while on a walk. The leash still needs to be held in your hand (or hands) to be able to maintain control over the dog. Leashes should never be wrapped around fingers or wrists to shorten them or try to get better control because if the dog lunges, you can break your bones, or your hand or arm can be damaged if the circulation is cut off. Either use a shorter leash or fold the leash and hold the folded leash in your hand . Some leashes have second handles half-way down the leash. This extra handle allows you to easily hold the leash with two hands. The second handle is sometimes called a “traffic handle” because it keeps the dog close to you if you’re on a busy street or sidewalk. Another nice design is a thumb handle. They have a wider handle, usually made of neoprene, with a hole in it for your thumb. The thumbhole makes it hard to accidentally drop the leash even if your dog pulls or you’re juggling the leash, treats, and a poop bag. These leashes are sometimes called “hands-free” but you’re still holding the leash in your hand. Hands-Free LeashesThese leashes attach to belts or can be belted around your waist, leaving your hands free. These leashes are popular with people who run with their dogs. They can be used in training a dog to walk politely on leash. Caution must be used with these as a strong dog could easily pull over the person at the other end of the leash, especially on slippery surfaces. The best of these have releases the dog’s end can be easily released from the belt in case you fall. Retractable LeashesRetractable leashes, which have cords that roll out and retract to plastic hand-held housing, are not recommended except under specific situations. They are dangerous to people and dogs. Some retractable leashes, especially ones with thin cords , have resulted in injuries to people either by slicing into bystander’s legs if they get between the dog and handler or cutting off people’s fingers if they are twisted in the cord. People have also received rope burns trying to reel in their dogs and because of the retraction that happens when there is no pressure on the leash, people have received facial and eye injuries when clips have broken and leashes flew at their faces. Dogs can receive similar injuries if entangled in these leashes. Many dogs, if they are running and the person drops the leash, become frightened by the sound of the plastic handle/leash housing “chasing them.” Dogs have been injured and killed trying to run away from their own retractable leashes. From a training standpoint, these are terrible tools. It is hard to teach a dog who is being walked on a retractable leash not to pull. These leashes reward pulling by giving him more length. They also do not give the owner much control. Once the dog has pulled out the leash, unless the dog is well trained to come back or stop on command, the owner has no way of shortening the leash quickly. The locking mechanism can be difficult to use, which can contribute to these problems. Dogs have been hit by cars, gotten into fights or bitten people while on retractable leashes. The freedom of movement that makes these leashes attractive is also what can make them so dangerous. Retractable leashes may be used safely with well-trained dogs who will stop on command and come back when called. They should only be used in places like open fields or beaches. In other words, places where there are no other people, dogs or obstacles for the leashes to get caught on, and dogs who will not lunge after things and will come back when called. Owners still need to take extra care that no one is injured by their leash, a problem that is unlikely with normal leashes. Before using a retractable leash, check the leash laws in the area as some locations have banned their use. Others allow them to be used with limitations, such as not allowing the length of the leash to exceed 6 feet if people are nearby. L.I.M.A. Leashes, collars and harnesses are all important tools for safely managing dogs. It’s also important that they are used humanely, which requires picking tools that fit with the L.I.M.A. principle: least intrusive minimally aversive. L.I.M.A. means that the collar or harness and leash doesn’t have negative effects on the dog’s behavior or mood and causes the least discomfort possible. The best way to achieve these goals is to not rely on leashes, harnesses or collars alone to keep a dog under control. Combine these tools with the much more powerful tool of positive reinforcement training for a dog who is happy and well behaved on walks.

Category: Help for Your Barking Dog
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Barking is a normal behavior and one of the ways dogs communicate. Some breeds have a higher tendency to bark, so barkingfrequency, volume, and duration vary by individual. Certain barking can be desirable, alerting your family to package deliveries, visitor arrivals, and potential intruders. But excessive barking can cause frustration, weakening the bond between you and your dog. Here are some behavior modification steps to help you and your dog gain peace and quiet. Step 1: Identify what triggers your dog to bark such as other dogs, people, wildlife, garbage trucks, or door knocking. Keeping a log is helpful and can speed up the behavior modification progress. Step 2: Find the situations causing your dog to bark such as perching on the couch, window watching during busy times when people and other dogs are passing by, kids playing after school or rabbits in the yard during the morning.  Step 3: Think about what you would like your dog to do instead of barking. For example, your dog can be taught to lie on a mat when the doorbell rings, grab a toy when a delivery arrives, hold a toy to muffle or stop barking, run to you for further instructions, or be quiet on cue after a certain number of barks. Step 4: Identify how you can manage the environment. Move or block the couch perch, play music, increase the TV volume to mask the sounds of kids playing, or cover the window with opaque film. Step 5: Set a time frame such as two weeks. Monitor your dog’s progress in your log.   Often people become frustrated with barking and try corrections such as yelling or throwing something at the dog, stomping feet and rushing toward the dog, or using a citronella or shock collar. These methods are rarely effective to stop barking, and, in some cases, may even make the barking worse. Your dog may become untrusting or fearful. It can be more effective to teach your dog what to do instead of barking. Management will be needed until your dog learns how to do something else. If your dog is anxious or has barking tendencies, or you are inconsistent with training new behaviors, it can be more challenging to stop the barking.   Some dogs might not improve despite consistently using these techniques. If you don’t find relief from barking, seek a consult with a certified veterinary behaviorist or other behavior professional. A positive reinforcement-based dog trainer can help speed your progress. A thorough assessment, customized treatment plan, and professional support might be your key to quiet.

Category: House Soiling Causes and Solutions in Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When a dog starts having housetraining accidents, it’s easy to believe the dog is acting out of anger or some other defiant motive. That is rarely the case. Let’s look at reasons for housetraining accidents and methods for improving your dog’s batting average. Medical Causes Medical causes should always be ruled out first. Any medical condition that causes increased frequency, urgency, or volume in urine or stool can lead to house soiling. Having the dog evaluated by your veterinarian is a good idea. Your veterinarian may recommend specific testing such as fecal, urine, and blood tests based on your dog’s specific problems and the results of the physical exam. Behavioral Causes Once medical causes have been eliminated, consider these behavior causes. Getting to the root of the problem will ensure proper treatment and the best chance for successful resolution of the problem. Be a Detective—and a Friend You can see from this long list that a lot of things can throw off a dog’s housetraining habit. You need to determine what could be causing your dog’s problem. There could be multiple reasons. With your veterinarian’s help and possibly the help of a behavior specialist, you can make it better. Housetraining is a habit. The dog doesn’t understand why we want this, and yet dogs are so adaptable that most of them can be helped to develop the housetraining habit and to restore it when something has interfered. Even people have bathroom problems from time to time, so we shouldn’t be at all surprised that it happens with dogs. One way dogs help humans to live longer, healthier lives is by needing our care. This is a day-to-day reason to get out of bed and to think beyond our own problems. You could even say that housetraining is good for us!

Category: House Training Adult Dogs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When house training an adult dog, the process is the same as with a new puppy. Although you may have been told your new adult dog is house trained, that may not be the case in your home. When first brought home, you may not be able to recognize your dog’s need to go out and they do not know how to go out. Keep slip-on shoes and a leash near the door so you can quickly take them out when they wake up, after they eat, when they are sniffing for a spot, or looking restless. Be patient and take them outside frequently. Keep treats handy near the door to grab as you go outside to your dog's designated potty area. As soon as your dog goes to the bathroom, reward them with several of their favorite treats. Shower your dog with treats when they go to the bathroom outside, don't wait to treat them after they come back in. Giving so many treats like this may be frightening to your dog, causing them to refuse the treat. If this happens, remain calm and try putting the treat on the ground near them. If they still refuse the treat, try reinforcing another way, like going back inside or letting them sniff the grass or a tree. You can also try tempting them with other treats to discover what your dog considers valuable. Adult dogs may prefer to potty on a specific surface. A dog that has spent their life in a kennel may prefer concrete over grass because this is familiar to them. To encourage your dog to go on different surfaces, try: Some dogs may have been punished for toileting in the house, causing them to avoid going to the bathroom in front of people. Take them out in a safe area on a long leash or someplace where they can potty behind a tree or bush to give them privacy. Since some dogs have never gone to the bathroom while leashed, try using a lightweight long line and be sure to keep the leash loose, or go to a safely fenced-in area so they do not need to be leashed. For small dogs, an exercise pen on the grass can often work. Making accommodations may be short-term while you find what your dog prefers. Eventually, you can transition your dog to the area you choose. Help your dog understand where you want them to go by using a visual such as wood shavings in the area. Reinforce each time they toilet on the shavings, using fewer shavings until eventually your dog no longer needs the visual. Similar to training a puppy, your adult dog should not have free run of the house. Use exercise pens, baby gates, or doors to keep your dog with you until they are fully house trained and let you know they need to go out. It can take several months to fully housetrain. For accidents inside, use a good enzyme cleaner to remove odors to help prevent possible future marking behavior. If you have any concerns about your dog's bathroom habits, discuss the issues with your veterinarian to rule out medical conditions.

Category: Housetraining an Adult Dog or Rescue
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Housetraining an adult dog is similar to house training a puppy. With adult dogs, just like with a puppy, you need to supervise them 100 percent of the time they are indoors until the habit of waiting to relieve outside is firmly established. If you have an adult dog not used to holding his bladder or bowels, he will need time to develop bladder and bowel control. The general rule of thumb is that your dog should be accident-free for one month before gradually giving him more freedom around the house. Supervising 100 percent of the time means that your dog is either in a "safe" area where they can't make a mistake, such as a crate or very small room with a baby-gate, or they are in the room with you and you are watching them at all times. It may help to have them on leash and tie the leash to your belt buckle. When a dog has a housetraining accident, it's not the dog's fault, it means the person failed in supervising. Confinement of some sort is necessary to keep the dog from making mistakes that will form the wrong housetraining habits. A crate should be big enough for the dog to stand up, lie down, and turn around in a circle. Dogs have a natural instinct to keep their resting area clean. If the crate is too big they will establish separate resting and relief areas. The crate is only to be used when no one can watch your dog. Since dogs sleep 14 hours a day, a crate is a humane and reasonable way to aid in housetraining most dogs, with the dog merely sleeping most of the time he is in the crate. It is important to introduce the crate slowly with treats to make it a positive experience so that your dog does not panic when you put him in the crate. Baby gates can be effective, but they are not as secure as crates. It's a great service to a dog to teach him to rest calmly in a crate, even if you only use it for training and then put it away in the closet to save for emergencies. Dogs have to rest in crates when they are in for veterinary care and other situations. If at some future time in his life the dog develops separation anxiety (where dogs may tear up the house, urinate, defecate or vocalize due to feeling stressed), the ability to rest in a crate could save him in his home. And in case of travel and disasters, sometimes the only dogs who are able to stay with their owners are the dogs who can handle being in a crate. It's generally best to teach your dog to be in a crate a little at a time. When your dog goes outside during the housetraining process you need to go with him every time so you can praise your dog, or better yet give him a tasty treat right when he finishes urinating or defecating. This is a lot of work, but in the process your dog learns what you want and you figure out his schedule because you were there. You also know whether your dog relieved his bowels or bladder or both, and when. Soon, you know how many times a day your dog needs to do each of those functions. Dogs are not all the same about these needs, and the frequency also changes with age, illness, changes in diet, and changes in schedule - your schedule as well as your dog’s schedule. Make sure all spots in the house where your dog might have relieved himself have been cleaned in the right manner to tell his keen sense of smell and doggy instincts that the house is not a bathroom. If you don't do this, the scent he can smell - even though you can't smell it - will draw him back to use the spot again. Bacterial enzymatic odor eliminating products will work either on a fresh spot or on a spot that was not treated promptly. Deodorants and disinfectants normally used for cleaning don't remove this special scent.  And perhaps the worst thing to use is ammonia. Urine contains ammonia, so this actually signals your dog's nose that this is the spot! Never punish your dog for a housetraining mistake. He won't understand and the punishment can create new problems. Instead, keep him in the room with you at all times when he is not in his special confinement area. If you see him start to have an accident, just say "Outside" as you rush out the door with him. Your goal is to get him to finish outside so you can praise him. Teach him the word "Outside" for going out there, and "Better Go Now" or some other phrase for actually relieving himself--these words are taught just by saying them at the right times, until he catches on to what they mean. This helps communication, and thus also helps training. Housetraining a dog of any age requires diligence, commitment, patience, and good-nature from the owner. If the dog makes a mistake when you weren't watching him, oops, that was your mistake, not his. He is just a dog, and has no idea why you are upset when he relieves himself in the house. But most dogs can learn, if you are consistent, and help him avoid mistakes by being there for him.

Category: How to Stop Pulling
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Katharine Schwarz, RVT, KPA CTP Why do dogs pull when leashed? Leash pulling is a common complaint among dog owners. Why do they do it? The world is an exciting place full of new scents, sights, sounds, playmates, etc. Leash pulling is a self-reinforcing behavior, which means that when the dog pulls, they get to go where they want, which is not necessarily where you want to go. Since the behavior works, the dog is likely to continue doing it. What do you want instead? Picture what you would like your dog to do, instead of pulling. For most people, teaching their dog to walk on aloose leashis sufficient.  This involves teaching the dog that walking with a loose leash will be reinforced with forward movement. To teach this, you’ll want to first teach the behavior in an easy location, add acue, and then start to use it in more challenging locations. Use the right tools No matter which tool you choose, you will still need to teach your dog how to walk beside you. It is best to think of these as safety tools rather than training tools. While your dog is learning to walk on a loose leash, use a Y-shaped, front-attaching harness. These harnesses attach around the dog’s chest. They do not impede movement or put pressure on the neck. This harness is a great way to gently redirect the dog back to you. Use a lead that is long enough to provide some slack in the leash, usually 4-6 feet long, sturdy enough for your dog, and is comfortable for you to hold. Try tying a knot in your leash to remind you where to hold your leash to create the optimal length for your dog.  Tools to avoid Retractable/extendable leashes Retractable or extendable leashes are not recommended for training because your dog never has a consistent amount of length, which makes it harder for them to learn how close to stay to you. There are other issues with these leashes, such as injuries to humans and dogs (abrasions, burns, deep wounds, finger amputations, etc.) along with the leash itself breaking. Neck collars When attached to a leash, collars can put a lot of pressure on the neck, possibly harming the trachea, spine, thyroid, etc. Avoid putting pressure on the neck to reduce the possibility for injury or harm to these structures. Back attaching harnesses When pressure is applied, dogs push back into that pressure and are more likely to pull forward. If the dog pulls and gets to move forward, then the behavior has been reinforced and will be repeated. These harnesses are not recommended if you are new to training and practicing loose leash walking. Prong, choke, shock collars Don’t use prong, choke, or shock collars as these tools teach your dog to avoid an unpleasant or painful stimulus instead of teaching your dog the desired behavior. Step 1: Get the behavior For dogs who already pull on the leash, it is best to start in an easy location while trying to change the behavior. Often, the best place to start is in your living room. Leash your dog and practice offering a treat at your side every couple of steps as you walk around the room. There are several goals while doing this:   Step 2: Name the behavior Attach a cue so that your dog knows when they should be walking close by.  Step 3: Take it on the road…slowly Once your dog consistently walks on a loose leash inside your home, try the same exercise in your backyard or for a short distance outside your home. Practice for short durations, reward generously, be patient, and always be fair! For some dogs, this is the equivalent of a child doing math problems while on vacation.

Category: How to Teach Your Dog to Come to You
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Recall training should create memories of fun, fast returns to you. A recall taught with positive reinforcement is fun for your puppy or newly adopted dog and is a great way to bond with them. Start teaching your puppy this life-saving skill when you bring them home. Training recalls and building good habits require high-value rewards: special treats, games, or praise and play. Begin training recalls in the house at a distance of one to two feet. Always show excitement when they come to you to establish happy associations. Do not expect your dog to run to you successfully from 100 yards without getting distracted. Add distance slowly. Teach recalls using games to create a strong, positive association. These games can be played for a few minutes daily and should be fun for you and your dog. Change up games so your dog is comfortable and is having fun or make them more challenging by playing in a new location. Begin teaching recalls inside the house. As your dog continues to successfully return to you, practice in the yard where there are a few more distractions. As they continue to do well, add more distractions by changing the location. Keep in mind you may need to adjust the treats, time of day, or location if: Some dogs learn that running away is more fun than coming back. Once a dog has started chasing livestock, visiting the neighbor’s dog, or eating trash, they are more likely to continue these behaviors because they are fun. Keep your dog leashed or fenced. Recall training should be fun. If your dog does not recall reliably, please contact a qualified positive reinforcement-based trainer or board-certified veterinarian.

Category: Identifying a Qualified Dog Trainer or Behavior Professional
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The Reality of the Animal Training Industry Animal training is a booming industry. We love our pets, and we want the best for them. We also want to live with them harmoniously. Many pet owners seek out professional pet behavior help on their own as well, whether it is for puppy class or to manage an existing behavior problem. Trainers and behavior professionals are also sought out by veterinarians, shelter staff, and other animal care professionals to refer clients for training. All it takes is a quick internet search, and you will be met with an overwhelming, never-ending list of animal trainers. It can be confusing to navigate this. There are several training programs, certifications, and credentials available for trainers and behaviorists. Be aware that ‘behaviorist’ is not necessarily a specific legal term: those with an MS or PhD in behavior are called ‘behaviorists;’ people without these or any credentials may be allowed to self-adopt the term ‘behaviorist.’ Additionally, while some credentials can be beneficial in many cases, they are not a guarantee that your trainer is using ethical, humane, or scientifically based methods. How can you narrow your search for a qualified trainer or behavior professional? The unfortunate reality is that anyone can call themselves a trainer because the training industry is not regulated. Additionally, just because a trainer has credentials does not mean that they are using methods that are ethical or supported by science.  As with any other product or service, marketing plays a large role. Sponsored pages on Google and Facebook will show up first on the list because they pay to be there. Just because they pay to be seen first does not mean they should be your first choice. Being skilled at marketing does not make them a skilled trainer. Finding a qualified trainer or behavior professional is not an easy or simple task. It takes time, knowledge, and persistence. Qualified trainers or behavior professionals are not often the ones that show up on the top of a Google search. They are not usually the ones on a TV show, nor the ones bringing lunch and flyers to your veterinarian's office. It is important to learn how to navigate this dilemma, as the methods used by trainers and behavior professionals can have a profound impact on your pet’s welfare and the human-animal bond. Why Using a Qualified Trainer or Behavior Professional Matters It is incredibly important for veterinarians and other pet professionals to know how to refer to qualified trainers and other behavior professionals. Research has shown that reward-based training is more effective and more humane than aversive methods. Reward-based training focuses on teaching the animal what to do without using force instead of what NOT to do. Reward-based training works to increase the animal’s motivation and improve their emotional state, which encourages them to learn and enjoy training. Research also shows that training styles that use force and aversive techniques increase fear and aggression in dogs, creating safety and welfare concerns that would otherwise not exist. Aversive methods may be effective when teaching a dog what NOT to do,  but also can cause more severe behavior problems and negatively impact the human-animal bond. What Makes a Trainer or Behavior Professional Qualified? There are several training programs, certifications, and credentials available for trainers and behaviorists.

Category: Importance of Socializing Puppies and Kittens
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Socialization? The word socialization is a bit misleading when taken literally. Socialization sounds like teaching a puppy or kitten how to socialize with other puppies or kittens. While these kinds of interactions help them learn to act like a normal dog or cat, this is only part of what socialization means and why it is important.  It’s much more than learning how to interact with other animals of the same species. Domestic dogs and cats don’t live in the wild and need to take their cues from more than just their pack mates. Socialization is getting puppies and kittens used to people, other animals, and experiences that they will encounter frequently in their adult lives. More than just conforming to dog and cat norms, it’s learning to accept everything around them, such as people, car rides, grooming, vacuum cleaners, noises, other animals, and other household pets. This involves gently exposing puppies and kittens to new things that they will deal with regularly as adults so that they can react confidently and appropriately rather than fearfully or with anxiety. Socialization is especially important for orphans because they received little if any interaction with their mother and family, and may have no basis at all for how to act around others. Breed, health, and personality also play a factor in the way a pet behaves with others, even if properly socialized. Some dogs and cats are not as outgoing or social as others and do not enjoy spending time with big groups of people or animals. Socialization is not necessarily about teaching them to want these interactions, but more about teaching them how to handle themselves and communicate appropriately within their environments. When to Socialize Developmentally, the best time for socialization is between 3-14 weeks of age in puppies and 3-9 weeks in kittens. During this period growth, they form relationships and attachments easily. Their senses are more developed, they are more independent, and they are physically capable enough to interact with others. Start socialization efforts as early as possible within this time period to maximize their benefits. During this key socialization period, any experiences that occur will have long-lasting effects on a puppy’s or kitten’s future learning and interactions with others. Unfortunately, that means negative experiences will also have lasting effects. It is critical that this time period be positive and safe. How to Socialize a Puppy or Kitten Remember that the purpose of socialization is to have the puppy or kitten interact with other people, animals, and things in order to be comfortable with the environment in which they live. When socializing, it is important to minimize discipline or training. Don’t try to reinforce commands or proper behaviors because that takes your pet’s attention away from the new experiences. It is also important to balance play with these learning experiences. Put your pet in situations that she may experience as an adult, such as car rides, being in a carrier, toys, grooming procedures, meeting other animals, meeting new people, and trips to the veterinarian. Introduce your puppy or kitten to new people, animals, and things in a nonthreatening manner, which means it’s not scary to the kitten or puppy. If your pet reacts with fear, you likely need to scale back the interaction to the level the puppy or kitten is comfortable. This could mean letting them watch instead of play, distracting them with treats, or moving them farther away from whatever they are afraid of until they become comfortable. Never punish a fearful puppy or kitten if they are anxious during interactions. This is an important time in their development and creating fearful situations will only lead to more problems in the future. It is also fine for a pet to not interact during these times as socialization is a time for watching and learning; just remember to keep things relaxed. Gently touch, hold or restrain, and physically interact with your pet every day. This is especially important at an early age because it helps your young pet become comfortable with humans and being handled, and it also helps to speed and enhance their physical and mental development. Puppies and kittens need to interact with non-family members (including children) so they get used to meeting and being around new people when they are adults. Handling your puppy or kitten should include gently touching the face, ears, and paws to make grooming and examinations easier. Restraining them means holding them in place gently and in a non-threatening manner so they can get used to being held and to promote calm demeanors for veterinary check-ups or grooming. Some veterinary behaviorists suggest that during the socialization period a puppy or kitten should meet 5 to 10 new people each week and that they should experience being in a new place at least once a week. They should be exposed to new sights, sounds, tastes, and smells. Keep things positive and non-threatening with treats, toys, and affection. What if my Puppy or Kitten Isn’t Fully Vaccinated? Spending time with healthy, fully vaccinated animals should be safe for your puppy or kitten. You can arrange play dates with animals you know are vaccinated. However, try to avoid exposing your pet to an unvaccinated animal, such as at the dog park. This is especially true with young animals because they are more vulnerable to infections than adults. Exposure to puppies and kittens who are not old enough to have received all their vaccines is considered by some to be a calculated risk. This means that while there is a risk for catching a disease, it may not be as much of a concern in the right setting. As an example, a study assessed the risk of infection for parvovirus in appropriately run puppy classes: puppies were otherwise healthy, the place was clean and sanitary, and all the puppies were up to date on vaccines for their age groups. Of 1,012 puppies studied, no increased risk for contracting parvovirus was found when compared with puppies not attending class. Consequences of Not Socializing Socializing puppies and kittens early within the socialization developmental period has been shown to decrease fear, aggression, and anxiety of new people, animals, or situations. Pets not properly socialized often have an increased sensitivity to new experiences. They are often fearful of people or other animals, even within their own species. This can result in avoiding people or other animals, anxious behaviors, or even hostility or violence towards others. Lack of socialization can also delay development and decrease the puppy’s or kitten’s ability to learn and make connections about social norms, including sleeping habits and where and when to find food. These issues can make it difficult for them to live easily with others and in some cases may lead to them being re-homed or sent to animal shelters. Giving your new puppy or kitten (or young animal of any species) significant socialization during that critical stage will pay off handsomely by helping your pet become a confident adult.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Melissa Spooner-Raymond, LVT, VTS (Behavior), BS, KPA-CTP, TAGteach Level One Loose Leash Walking Whenwalking your dog, you can determine how loose leash walking works best for you. You may not have a right or left side preference, or desire to have your dog perfectly aligned with your leg. You may be okay with having them walk a few steps ahead of you. You may be perfectly happy as long as they are not pulling you. If you decide that basic loose leash walking is more your speed than heeling, that is okay. Dogs that respond to their owner’s simple request on a walk are just as well behaved. When you try loose leash walking, carry items that your dog finds to be highly rewarding. In most instances, food is the best choice, but if your dog passes up food to play with a tennis ball or other toy, bring that along. How to Teach Loose Leash Walking One of the easiest ways to teach a dog to maintain a loose leash is by rewarding them when they do it accidentally. Once you feel your dog’s leash become loose on its own, make sure to reward them. If you reward them every time you discover them doing something you like, they will begin to offer it more frequently. If you find that you cannot get the treat to your dog fast enough, don’t worry. Consider using a clicker or verbal marker like “yes” in your training to help your dog identify those desirable behaviors. What if you walk your dog and you never achieve a loose leash, even for a few steps? If these modifications still don’t give you the success that you hoped for, using a management walking tool is the next change to consider. Walking Tools for Management There is no shortage of loose leash walking devices available on the market. Each one promises to be better than the previous one. When selecting one, asking for help from a training or behavior professional will likely offer the best result. Set your dog up for success by using a tool that allows more opportunities for good behavior. Remember, your goal is to capture your dog being good. Tools such as a front-leading body harness or a head halter will help to maximize leash control and minimize discomfort. Avoid tools that cause pain, discomfort, or fear. Tools that inflict shock, mild vibration, cause pain on sensitive organs, or cut off oxygen supply for even short periods may interrupt behaviors you do not like, but will likely cause other problematic behaviors. Look at the world from your dog’s perspective. The less often you go for walks, the more novel and exciting it will be when they get the opportunity to explore. Try to understand their excitement. Be sure to make the walk equally as enjoyable for them as it is for you. Be kind and fair in your training methods, and always make time for a few good smells.

Category: Low Stress Toothbrushing
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dental disease is painful and most pets over the age of three suffer from gum disease. Recommended by veterinarians, daily toothbrushing is one of the best ways to slow the progression of dental disease, lengthen the time between professional cleanings, and has many other benefits to your pet’s overall health. For some pets, a toothbrush is scary and, for many pet owners, hard to maneuver in the mouth making brushing a chore. Be aware that if your pet has dental disease, brushing with your finger may cause pain and use caution not to get bitten. How can we make brushing less of a chore and more fun for all? The answer: 3”x3” cotton gauze squares Gauze is more abrasive and effective than rubber finger brushes and less invasive than a brush with a handle. Gauze allows you to feel when you’re touching the teeth instead of the delicate gums. Check with your veterinarian and stop brushing immediately if your pet seems painful or bleeding occurs. Choosing the Toothpaste: When brushing teeth, it is important to choose a toothpaste specifically designed for pets and approved by theVOHC (Veterinary Oral Health Council). Avoid human toothpaste since some contain Xylitol which is toxic to pets. From the many flavors available, find one your pet likes best. If your pet is still resistant, start the training process with tuna juice or gravy to help create a strong positive association with brushing. Let’s start brushing! Step 1:Unfold the gauze square and wrap it around your index finger. Pinch the tail of the gauze with your thumb. Step 2:Dip your fingertip into the juice or gravy or place a pea-sized dot of pet toothpaste on your fingertip and allow your pet to lick your fingertip. Repeat three times. Your pet should quickly and eagerly approach and lick your finger before you move to the next step. Step 3:Repeat steps 1-3 and slide your finger under your pet’s upper lip and make a gentle brief brush action. Then allow them to lick the remaining toothpaste. Repeat three times. Your pet should approach and not back away from your finger. Avoid restraining your pet’s head or following them if they move their head away. Repeat until your pet is holding still and eagerly licking the toothpaste. Step 4:Repeat the above steps and place your finger farther towards the top back teeth. Gradually increase the gentle brushing swipes then allow your pet to lick the remaining toothpaste. You can place your hand under their chin to steady their head if necessary. Step 5:Repeat the above technique to brush the outside of the lower teeth on the same side. Step 6:Wrap a new piece of gauze around your finger to regain abrasiveness, apply more toothpaste and brush the top and bottom teeth on the other side of the mouth. Your pet’s mouth is now healthier! Remember: When you brush your pet’s teeth it’s okay if you aren’t perfect. It is more important for your pet to be comfortable and willing to accept frequent brushing. Strive for brushing every day. Set yourself up for success by placing your pet’s toothpaste where you will incorporate it into your daily routine. Spend a little bit of time teaching your pet to enjoy toothbrushing for positive results. Your pet’s health will improve, your veterinarian will be pleased you’re being proactive, and you can save money by decreasing the frequency and intensity of professional dental cleanings.

Category: Mat Training in Dogs: Setting the Mood
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Teaching to go to a mat Teaching your pet to go to a mat, called stationing, can be used to:  Before you even start doing mat work with your pet, make sure the surrounding area is set up for success. Minimize any potential distractions for both of you: turn off your cell phone, work away from windows and doors, practice when the rest of the family is out of the house. Lowering the blinds, closing the curtains and dimming the lights can all help create a calming atmosphere so both of you can focus. The more inviting it is for your dog, the easier and quicker this behavior can be taught. He will quickly associate the mat with his own happy place.    Use a mat that won’t slip across the floor. A yoga mat or folded beach towel can work perfectly and be easily portable. A non-slip backing can be part of the mat or a separate layer underneath it, such as rubber shelf lining.   Eventually the mat becomes a place both inside and outside of the home for the dog to seek out on his own. Place the mat away from furniture in a low traffic area so your dog has room to roll over on it and not hit anything. You should be able to sit nearby to quietly observe him. Stay in this location until the behavior is learned. Move the mat in future sessions so the dog targets the mat itself rather than the location.

Category: Mat Training in Dogs: Teaching to Station on the Mat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Step 1: Reward for Interacting With the Mat Mat trainingis an important foundation skill to teach any animal. It can begin the moment the dog looks at the mat, goes near the mat, or steps onto the mat by marking the behavior with a click or word, to let him know this is what you want. Marking is a signal given to your pet to indicate that they are doing what you expect.   Step 2: Shaping the Behavior If he does not willingly step onto the mat, you may also position yourself on the opposite side of the mat from your dog and mark as he steps on it to come to you. At first it may only be one paw, but you will then begin shaping for two, then three, then four feet by increasing the value of the treat. Kibble is the lowest and chicken, or hot dogs or cheese being the highest. You are marking any positive interaction he has with the mat that is getting him to your end goal of lying down on the mat. He will quickly learn that good things happen in the form of delicious treats on this mat and he will want to be on this mat.   Step 3: Lie on the Mat Any behavior he displays that is closer to lying down on the mat earns him a higher value treat, such as chicken, cheese, hot dog. Any other behaviors he displays while on the mat earns lower value treats such as his kibble. He will soon realize that lying down earns him a better treat or “paycheck”. If necessary, to encourage lying down, you may use the down cue a few times, mark and reinforce with a high value treat. Then he should offer a down on his own and be given several high value treats while you continue to reward other displayed behaviors with lower value treats. Next walk away a few steps and encourage your dog to follow you. Then stand still and your dog should return to the mat for more treats. Reinforce with low to medium value treats for going to the mat and high value for lying down on the mat. When your dog is successfully returning to his mat after 3-5 repetitions at this distance, take a couple of further steps away from the mat. Repeat a few more times. If he is not consistent at the new distance, take a step back closer to the mat, to the last place he was successful. Step 4: Adding Duration - Stretching the Time Between Treats When the dog is consistently lying on the mat, hold off on reinforcing for one second, then two seconds, five seconds and so on to teach the dog to hold the down position on the mat. If he continually sits up, go back a step in the process. Step 5: Introducing a Cue - Pairing a Word to Name the Behavior When the dog is going to his mat and lying on it, holding the position and looking to you for a treat, introduce your cue. It can be any word you prefer. Mark followed by a treat. Use this cue to send him to a down on a mat from a foot away, two feet away, then greater distances. Reinforce with high value treats.   Step 6: Down On a Mat When you have a high rate of success of going to the mat on cue and lying down, you can start introducing distractions. Gradually increase distractions by reinforcing with a high-level treat for a held down position. Distractions can include: Step 7: Teaching a Release Word To reduce your dog’s confusion a release word, can be taught to let your dog know he it is okay to leave the mat and the training session is over. Using a cue, such as take a break, or all done. Remember, train in baby steps. Go back a step if there’s any point at which your dog is not making progress. Training sessions should be short, 5-10 minutes, once daily to start but can lengthen as his attention span grows. Always end on a good note with a game afterward. The next practice session should begin at the last successful step. Step 8: Relaxing On the Mat When your dog goes to his mat on cue, lies down and remains in position until released training shifts to teaching a much deeper state of relaxation. To accomplish this, reinforce with low value treats: We do not use the clicker for marking these behaviors instead use low value treats. The clicker can overstimulate some dogs as that sound usually means tasty treats. Rely on soft spoken cues and less exciting rewards. Choose your cue, such as relax or rest, and for each level of relaxation use kibble less frequently. Remember to remain still and close to your dog to watch his body language closely. Always offer treats close to his mouth so he does not bounce up for it. As the dog progresses through each level of relaxation, say the cue more softly, more deeply and give fewer rewards. The steps of relaxing become self-reinforcing. The end goal is for the dog to be flat out on his side, mouth relaxed, eyes closed, deep slow breaths, or asleep. Think of this as deep meditation for your dog. Eventually the mat becomes the cue for a happy, restful place the dog wants to be during times of stress.

Category: Mouthing and Play Biting in Puppies
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Biting is a normal behavior in puppies. Just like human babies, they often explore everything with their mouths. Since they don’t have hands puppies frequently use their mouths as part of the normal play with other dogs and humans. Although normal, puppies have sharp teeth and their biting can be persistent. It is not uncommon for puppy owners to quickly become frustrated, damaging the relationship between humans and dogs. To reduce these unwanted behaviors, you will need to prevent, manage, and modify your puppy’s environments to reduce opportunities for mouthing and biting.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many dogs do not like having their nails trimmed and some are outright petrified. Dogs can be taught to file their own nails using a nail board. Dogs learn to scratch on the board using a scratching or digging motion. Nail boards can be purchased or hand made using a board, duct tape, and coarse or medium sandpaper. Learning to use the Nail Board Dogs learn quickly how to use a nail board with minimal training. You shape the behavior by breaking down the completed behavior of scratching the board into smaller steps, rewarding your dog for completing each step. These steps include approaching the board, touching it with any body part, touching with a paw, touching with multiple paws, moving the paw while touching the board, and finally scratching the board with each paw. When rewarding your dog, treats can be rolled down the board. Minimal Training Required Another alternative to nail board training is to incorporate fun games.

Category: Puppy Confinement Training Tips
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The goal of confinement training is for the puppy to be comfortable in their crate or other safe haven, such as an exercise pen or behind a gate. This area should not be used as a punishment but as a relaxing place to go for nap time or to gnaw on a chew toy. When you bring your puppy home, be sure to have the crate accessible from the family’s common space. For some people, it will be convenient to have multiple crates, such as in the living room, bedroom, and office. Crate training can go wrong when people confine the puppy and then leave. Puppies should not be left to “cry it out” and crates should never be kicked or shaken to quiet a puppy. Begin by either removing the door or tying it back so it doesn’t startle your puppy. Toss several treats in the back of the crate and allow the puppy to find them. Do this multiple times a day and when the puppy goes inside to check for treats, you can reward them again. Next, add the door. As your puppy goes into the crate, gently close the door, and give your puppy a treat through the door. Open the door and allow them to come out. Only close the door for a few seconds at first, then slowly increase how long the puppy is confined. To practice, have the crate nearby while you watch a movie, read a book or work at your computer. Your puppy should have a safe chew, or you can drop treats in the crate in the same spot each time so that the puppy can relax rather than hunt for them. If your puppy is relaxed with you nearby, try doing some activities with a little more movement, such as folding laundry or making dinner. Your puppy should still be able to see you and you should continue to give treats. If your puppy remains comfortable, try briefly leaving the room, then return and give a treat. If your dog gets upset, leave for a shorter time and return before they become stressed, giving a treat before they vocalize. If they still seem upset, let them out. Don’t let the puppy continue to cry. Before practicing crate confinement, be sure your puppy has been taken outside to the bathroom and is ready for a nap. Too much time in a crate can make the dog anxious. Confinement can be scary and frustrating for your new puppy so go slowly with training. A negative experience in the crate can make training harder. Keep sessions short and positive. If you are concerned that your puppy is showing signs of separation anxiety, seekprofessional help.

Translating Return to English Pat Koven, LVT, KPA-CTP Teaching voluntary behaviors such as a chin rest can be useful when you want your dog to hold still and show you they are comfortable. A chin rest shows that your dog is willing to be an active participant in their care. Teaching a chin rest can be part of a dog's behavior modification plan when they are resistant to needed care, such as applying eye drops and ear medication. This is sometimes called cooperative veterinary care. Your dog can learn to target a chin rest to your palm as a stationary position, on a walk, target on a towel, or the arm of a wheelchair for petting in therapy work. To prepare for training have high-value soft treats, and identify a comfortable height and position for both animal and trainer, such as a rolled up towel on a chair. When teaching this behavior, it is important to keep your hands steady, so your dog is not nervous. Step 1: Stationary Chin Rest  With their chin on your palm, begin adding duration by counting to 1 second then reward. Then begin rewarding at random times such as 3 seconds, then 2 seconds, then 4 seconds, so your dog does not learn a pattern.

Category: Teaching Your Dog To Lie on Their Side for Nail Trims
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Training consent behaviors builds confidence, promotes force-free learning, and increases your pet’s cooperation. When your dog offers aconsent behaviorthey are giving permission for something to happen. It is the “green light” that communicates your dog is ready to participate in a procedure. If they move out of position, it is the “red light” to stop. Lateral recumbency is the positioning of an animal on their side with their head on the ground. In this position, it is easy to see and access the paws for nail trims.  Your dog can be taught this position as a consent behavior, and it may be done on a mat on the ground or an elevated surface such as a couch. Your dog shows willingness to cooperate for a nail trim by moving into this position. Lifting their head off the ground is an indication to stop the procedure. Continue paw handling and nail trims when they place their head back down. Choose a mat or other comfortable surface to teach this behavior. Lure your dog into a down position, mark and treat:   Hold a treat near your dog’s nose and move the treat from their nose toward their shoulder, then mark and treat once they shift onto their hip into a relaxed down position:   Hold a treat near your dog’s nose and move it slowly toward their ribs/mid-spine area. Your dog should shift onto their shoulder. Then mark and treat:   Hold a treat near your dog’s nose and move it in a circle from their nose, over the shoulder, and up and over the back area then back to the nose. Your dog should move onto their shoulder and place their head onto the ground. Mark and treat:   Dogs may have difficulty moving downward from elbow to shoulder. Placing a pillow behind the shoulder closest to the ground helps minimize the distance between your dog’s head and the ground and may be more comfortable for them: Go at your dog’s pace. Dogs may spend multiple sessions working on the same step before progressing. Since the mat, the nail trimmers, and position of your body become contextual cues, verbal cues may not be used for lateral positioning. When your dog offers the position at least 80 percent of the time in one session, then paw handling and nail trims can be trained using this consent behavior.

Category: Teaching Your Dog to Love the Cone
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Elizabethan collars (sometimes referred to as “cones of shame”) are necessary tools to keep pets from licking a surgical site, wound, or hot spot; chewing off bandages or splints; or scratching their ears or face. By desensitizing your dog to wearing a cone, it will be less stressful for your pet if and when they need to use one. Several types of cones are available, some of which are more comfortable for the animal. The method detailed below is illustrated with a clear plastic cone and a dog but it works for all types of cones and applies to both dogs and cats. Getting your pet used to the cone: Desensitization is only effective if your pet remains calm. If your pet becomes distressed, you will need to find a way to make the training easier. Step 1: Introduction Step 2: Interaction Step 3: Hold the cone Step 4: Head in the cone Step 5: Wearing the cone Finding an approach that will work for Rocco: Rocco is being offered some canned cheese spread to get him to put the cone on.  Notice how he leans away and turns his head, showing hesitancy. Rocco approaches to investigate and decide if it is something he wants. Rocco decides that the exercise is too hard and backs away without getting a treat. Notice how he is licking his lips and is standing farther from the cone. To make it easier for him, Dr. Sample moves her hand towards the cone opening. Rocco decides it is better and approaches to take the treat. Now Rocco relaxes near the cone while eating the canned cheese spread. When we found the approach that worked for Rocco, he was able to eat treats with the cone on.

Category: Three Tips to Reduce Barking in Your Dog
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  TIP 1: Block the view but not the light. “Out of Sight, Out of Mind” There are many different sights and sounds that stimulate barking out the window. Your dog is less likely to bark at what she can’t see. Window film is easy to install, allows light to filter in, and comes in different decorative designs. TIP 2: Reinforce an alternative behavior. Imagine your dog sitting nicely on a mat while you open the door to let guest in, receive a delivery, or just walk out the door to get the mail. Teaching your dog to “go” to a mat or stationing can help achieve this goal. Remote treat dispensers like the Treat and Train can easily help you reward your dog in place with a click of the remote. TIP 3: The quiet between barks means click and treat. Keep jars of treats and kibble stashed around the house to use during noise events such as thunderstorms and fireworks. Click and Treat when you dog takes a breath BUT not while he is actively barking. After a few clicks, you can wait for your dog to make eye contact before clicking and treating.

Category: Training Series: Target Training Dogs with Touch
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is targeting? Targeting is teaching your dog to touch a part of their body such as a paw, shoulder, hip, or nose to a specific object. The most common use is asking the dog to touch their nose to a person’s hand. Here we outline nose targeting. Why use targeting? Targeting is a fun and easy behavior to teach and is a basic skill or building block that can be used as part of teaching many different behaviors such as: Targeting is also a behavior that can be used to: Tools needed: What else can be used for targeting? Getting started with targeting:  Targeting an object It is helpful to teach dogs to target an object other than your hand if there is a concern for safety or at times when your hand is less practical such as when entering a crate. Follow the steps above using a target stick or other object instead of your hand. Adding in movement: When your dog is reliably touching your hand or the object with his nose on cue, you are ready to add movement to the touch behavior. Method 1: Person standing still with the target moving Hold out the target and cuetouch. When your dog approaches the object, move it slightly further away. Click and treat the dog for following and touching the target. Gradually increase the distance between the dog and the target. Method 2: Person walking with target While holding out the target, start slowly walking around the room and cue touch. When your dog follows and touches the target, click and treat.  Try walking backwards and cuetouchwhile holding out the target.  Alternate the object from one hand to the other and increase your speed as your dog gets more excited. Remember to click and treat for every nose touch. Adding in distractions Teach and practice this behavior in the house first.  Then around your yard, and on walks where the environment is naturally more distracting.

Category: Walking Your Dog
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Taking your dog for a walk should be an enjoyable event; walks are the primary reason some people get a dog. For some owners, issues arise that make going on walks less enjoyable. Let’s think about some options to help you both enjoy your walks more.  The Purpose of the Walk Before heading out with your four-legged best friend in tow, know the purpose of your walk. Is exercise your primary reason? Who needs the exercise, you, your dog, or both? Walking improves your cardiovascular health, builds stronger muscles, and lowers your blood pressure and stress levels. However, if it takes you 60 minutes to walk a half mile because your dog insists on eliminating at every mailbox or light post then your heart rate might never make it to the necessary levels for cardiovascular benefit. A simple solution is to walk in an area with fewer distractions. Avoid public parks, neighborhoods, and subdivisions that have many tempting distractions. Instead, choose an open field, a state park, or a beach. If your health is not the primary goal, then what is? Is your dog the one in need of exercise? Are you trying to improve their physique, or do you have another goal in mind? Often we look to walking as a solution for weight management or to burn off energy. If you have a busy dog that never runs out of energy, then taking them for regular walks seems like the best solution. As with humans, walking has many health benefits for dogs including building muscle and becoming stronger. However, over a period of time, you may notice a walk that previously tired them out no longer has the same effect. While walks are helpful for a dog that needs to shed some weight, they may not be ideal if your goal is to burn off energy. As their stamina increases, more intense walks may be needed to truly exhaust them. A solution to this issue may be to modify thetype of walkyou take. Walks as Enrichment Did you know that about 15 minutes of mental work for a dog is the equivalent of taking your dog on a 1-mile walk? Have you ever worked on a project intensely all day long and after you were done you felt like you ran a marathon? That is because your brain did all the heavy lifting. Mental exercise and brain games are often referred to as enrichment. Enrichment is not only enjoyable but also tiring! You can offer it to dogs in many different forms. Sniff walks are one of the many methods. This form of enrichment puts the responsibility of deciding where to go and how long to stay completely on the dog. If your dog wants to spend 15 minutes sniffing one single spot, let them.  As long as it is safe, allow them to have all the power. This may include following behind on the other end of the leash while your dog keeps their ears forward and their nose to the ground, as they track a particular scent. In order to help your dog understand the difference between a regular walk, where you want them to maintain good manners, and a sniff walk, put the various behaviors on a cue. Changing to a different leash for sniff time during your walk is one way of cueing your dog to start the behavior. Another may be to signal that it is okay to start by using a verbal cue such as “go sniff” and pointing to an area for them to go to. Another easily implemented form of enrichment is varying your path. It is easy to get stuck in a pattern of walking the same path time after time. Your dog knows exactly where and when to turn and may even show signs of reluctance once they know they are heading home. Even small variations on your walk will make it a more enriching experience for your dog. Training as Enrichment on Walks Training is another way to include enrichment in your walk. Positive reinforcement (reward based) training by itself can be an enjoyable way to interact with your dog. Up the ante and take your training on the go. Request your dog to follow known cues at different periods of your walk. Consider playing a game. You can plan the details of this game in advance or decide when you’re on the walk.  The behaviors you choose should be easy for your dog to offer and most of all fun! This exercise is all about tapping into your dog’s brain and making them think in varying environments with natural distractions. Keep it lighthearted. There should be no penalty for incorrect or undesirable behaviors. If your dog struggles, consider making it easier for them to get it right and keep moving forward. Choosing any one of these enrichment techniques are sure to successfully meet your dog’s mental needs and give you a reprieve from some of their unwanted hyperactivity.

Category: What Is a Marker and Why Is It Used in Training?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A marker is a word, sound or gesture that signals the exact moment your pet has offered a behavior you like and want repeated. It is a language bridge between species and communicates to your pet they have earned a reinforcement for something they just did. A marker is a camera snapshot, marking the split second of an act. Marking and reinforcing that moment increases the likelihood of your pet repeating that desired behavior. The marker predicts the reinforcement is coming and is a promise of a paycheck. The reward always comes immediately after the marker. A marker should be clear, concise, and consistent. It should be repeatable with minimal variation. A verbal marker should be the same word each time and used by everyone involved in your pet’s training. The word “yes” is short and positive sounding and more easily repeated than “good girl” or “good boy”. Verbal markers carry tone however which can influence your dog’s response, making them hesitant if they perceive your bad mood. Hand signals and gestures can be used as alternative markers for hearing-impaired animals, animals working at a far distance or underwater. A clicker is most often used as an audible marker. It is a preferred marker by most trainers and comes in many styles. The sound produced is consistent regardless of who is using it, without inflection or conveying tone. It will make the identical sound regardless of who is using it. A clicker can mark subtle movements, making training precise. Begin teaching the meaning of the marker by clicking, verbalizing, or gesturing then quickly giving the reinforcement. Repeat this five times. Then begin using the marker for training other behaviors.

Category: What Is Consent?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   Q:My vet suggested I work on consent training with my dog for his insulin injections. What does that mean? A:Consent is a hot buzzword in the animal behavior and training world. But what does consent really mean? Consent means your dog is giving permission before allowing something to happen to them. So, if dogs can’t talk, how do they give consent? They do this by offering consent behaviors voluntarily. Consent training is your pet’s choice and can be used with any animal. This type of training creates a stronger relationship between you and your pet. When freely offered, these behaviors indicate your dog’s trust in you. Pet owners can use this training for all types of handling: Communication is key with consent training. Your pet can be taught to demonstrate that they are willing participants in whatever comes next. If they do not offer a consent behavior, they are saying no, and this choice must be recognized and honored to keep that trust. If your dog repeatedly says no, then address what might be concerning them, such as a noisy environment or perhaps pain restricting their ability to get into position. It may be that they do not understand what you are asking. Because dogs do not speak the same language as humans, their consent requires different communication skills than a person might give. You are capturing and shaping known behaviors which can be used as start buttons. When your dog performs the “start”, they are signaling their permission for you to continue with any procedure. Petting is a common example of when consent should be requested. It is important never to invade a dog’s personal space and always ask them to come to you. If they do, and they are relaxed, you can try petting them along their shoulders and sides, then stop. If they look to you for more, nudge your hand, or lean against you, they are likely giving their permission for you to continue. You can also use behaviors for consent training that your dog already knows, such as sitting to put on their harness. It is important that your dog always has the option to walk away from these interactions if they need a break. Nose targeting to a cabinet full of grooming supplies could be a cue from your dog requesting brushing. Your dog can also demonstrate consent with any new behaviors you teach, such as: By using consent training, you are providing your dog opportunities to opt-in or out. If they do not perform the start button, give them a break, and evaluate why they may not want the procedure done. Start with simpler procedures and increase the reinforcement value. By giving them this communication tool, you are giving them choices, minimizing stress, and removing force. They will be more trusting, happier, and likely have fewer behavior concerns.

Category: What Is Cooperative Care in Veterinary Medicine?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Rachel Lees LVMT, KPA CTP, VTS (Behavior), FFCP (Veterinary) Animal behavior is a crucial aspect of veterinary care.  Whether your pet has pain or just “ain’t doing right,”  the pet’s behavior, body language, and overall demeanor is part of obtaining a thorough and precise physical examination.  Without this type of examination, symptoms and diagnoses may be missed that could make or break the treatment plans.  Without the ability to communicate, the pet may panic causing increased fear, stress, aggression, and anxiety that is associated with handling and restraint. When the veterinary staff is unable to successfully examine or handle a patient, it becomes a quality-of-life concern as the veterinary team cannot provide medical care. Observing behavior is an important part of every pet’s visit.  Staff should discuss behavioral concerns with you and give options for how they will make your pet’s visit as enjoyable as possible. Making Cooperative Care the Standard of Care for Each Patient Veterinary behavior professionals are often asked how veterinary staff can start using these techniques while keeping things straightforward.  Behavior medicine starts with opening the eyes of the veterinary team to “see” behavior.  Once you visualize a patient’s aggression as fear, stress, or anxiety, you cannot un-see it.  Implementing cooperative care techniques in practice is also a huge change for clinics.  Programs such as Low Stress Handling® and Fear Free® have created membership programs for individuals and teams to create a more behavior friendly atmosphere using special techniques such astowel wrapsand minimal restraint methods. You may notice food is often used during veterinary visits as a distractor. When using this method, it is important that the food be given just before the procedure begins. If your pet stops eating, then the team should stop and assess the emotional state of your pet. The goal is to make sure your pet always associates a positive experience with what’s happening. Sometimes other reinforcers are used such as play, scent, toys, petting, etc. depending on what your pet prefers. This method helps to prevent fear and anxiety but if your pet is already afraid at the clinic these distractors may not be enough. Cooperative care may be the next step needed to help your pet. Cooperative care provides your pet with an opportunity to opt in or out of a procedure, communicating their consent to treatment. An example of this would be teaching a dog to go to a mat for handling. In training sessions, the pet learns that when they move to their mat, handling will happen.  Therefore, if the dog chooses to go to the mat, they are giving consent to touching.  This teaches them that if they are uncomfortable, they can simply opt out by moving off the mat. They do not need to go to extremes such as biting to stop the handling. Another example is an offeredchin restto alloweye drops, ear cleaning, ornail trims. Cooperative care is not just limited to the veterinary clinic. Teaching your pet other behaviors to participate in husbandry procedures such as grooming,nail trims, topical monthlyflea treatments,eye medicating, etc. can also be done. A cat that voluntarily enters acarrieron cue is easier to take anywhere and less stressful for all. Learning how to prevent certain stressors at the clinic and at home will help your pet accept procedures.

Category: Why Would a Puppy Need to See a Veterinary Behaviorist?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most puppies don’t need to see a veterinary behaviorist. They need good early socialization and reward-based training to learn how to be “good dogs” in society and at home.  Unfortunately, there are some puppies whose behaviors are beyond what is considered normal for a puppy at their developmental stage. Consider them special-needs puppies, just as if they had a physical problem. Those are the puppies who would benefit from working with a board-certified veterinary behaviorist. Think of it this way:  most children do great with early socialization and learning from their families and at school. However, some children need early intervention to help them be more successful in society, and the same is true for puppies. Our knowledge of how to raise puppies to be good with people, other dogs, going to new places, and seeing new things has come a long way in the last 20 to 25 years.  We know there are benefits from appropriate early socialization, especially through well-run early puppy classes for ages 8-14 weeks old.  Gone are the days when puppy owners were told to wait until puppies had received all their puppy vaccinations before starting classes, or even to wait until they were 6 months old to start training. We have also learned that when puppies have extreme reactions to new experiences, they don’t outgrow these reactions.  These reactions can include being anxious or afraid of unfamiliar people, other animals, sounds, or new places. It can include reacting aggressively at unsuitable times such as when being handled gently, when prevented from doing something the puppy wants to do, or when overly stimulated. These dogs continue to be afraid, anxious and possibly aggressive as they mature, and their reactions may get more intense when they become adults around 2-3 years old. A special-needs puppy might be too fearful to meet new people, or who tries to get away or hide behind your legs if a neighbor approaches while you’re out for a walk.  They could also be a puppy who shows aggression (growling, baring teeth, biting) at a young age, or who are anxious about loud noises, such as thunderstorms or fireworks.  Normal socialization with these puppies often fails and the puppies aren’t able to overcome their anxieties.  For example, a normal but shy 9-week old puppy may stay behind her owner’s legs during the first session of a puppy class, but over the next week or so, she has overcome this shyness and is enjoying the class like the other puppies. But a special-needs puppy, even with delicious treats and everyone in the class trying to make her feel comfortable, not only doesn’t she overcome her fears but may become more afraid as the classes progress. If puppies use aggression at a young age, people may attempt to laugh it off, saying things like, “He thinks he’s such a big, tough dog,” while ignoring the anxiety or fear their aggression. Even worse, people may attempt to punish the puppy to stop the aggression, which is likely to make their anxiety and aggression worse and more dangerous, especially when they grow out of being a little puppy and become an adult dog. If you’re seeing any concerning behaviors from your puppy, see your veterinarian first to make sure that your puppy doesn’t have any underlying medical conditions causing the behavioral problems. If behavior concerns persist after the puppy is given a clean bill of health and your veterinarian has run out of ideas, referral to a veterinary behaviorist is the next step. A veterinary behaviorist can evaluate your puppy's behavior, look for any physical conditions that may be a factor in that behavior, formulate a diagnosis, and put together a behavioral treatment plan. Your puppy’s treatment plan will include humane, scientifically sound behavior modification and management recommendations. Medication may be prescribed if your pup’s veterinary behaviorist thinks it is appropriate. The purpose of behavioral medication is not to sedate a puppy, but to reduce anxiety and increase focus so it’s easier for them to learn new responses to things that make them anxious. A comprehensive behavioral treatment plan also includes follow-up plans to keep your puppy on the right track as she matures and reaches different developmental milestones. Max, a 4-month old Cocker Spaniel, is an example. His regular vet saw him for a vaccine appointment and to evaluate him for a prolapsed third eyelid (cherry eye).  The veterinarian was concerned at the level of fear and aggression that Max displayed during the exam and vaccines and about Max’s behavior at home.  When his vet learned that Max would bark and growl at visitors, including when their high-school aged child came back from staying at her mother’s house, he referred Max to a veterinary behaviorist. At home where the behaviorist saw him, Max was unable to relax with this new person in the house.  He would not take treats and even when put in another part of the house where he could no longer see the stranger, he continued to bark and react if he heard the behaviorist's voice.  Max showed no aggression towards family members except the daughter who was only home part-time.  He was afraid of some inanimate objects, like garden decorations, and too fearful to go for leash walks. Max was started on a course of behavior modification exercises and medication. His owners were diligent about working on them and not pushing him beyond what he could handle. His regular vet used low-stress handling techniques, including sedative medications, to lower Max’s stress during appointments and surgery to neuter and correct his cherry eye. Max made slow but steady progress as the right combination of medications to help him was found. He will never be an outgoing or social dog, but at a follow up house call when Max was 18 months old, he was able to follow simple commands for the behaviorist and took treats from their hand. He is kept separated from most visitors because he still becomes fearful with some people, but he no longer barks and growls while they are in the house. Thanks to the well-timed behavioral intervention, Max’s people have turned Max’s fearful behavior down a couple of notches, making him far easier to live with and a better-behaved member of society. That difference will make a significant difference in the quality of life for Max and his people.
