Category: Allergy Testing in Horses with Asthma
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine asthma is the most common non-infectious respiratory disease occurring in adult horses. The disease was called heaves or COPD but is now called asthma. It’s believed to be related to allergies caused by organic dust in the bedding and feed as well as the concentration of ammonia in horses’ stalls. Several different organic compounds have been found in stable dust, including bacterial endotoxins, over 50 different species of molds, storage mites, and plant particles. It seems mold spores are the cause of an allergic reaction leading to symptoms of asthma such as labored breathing and coughing. Veterinary researchers in Germany worked to find which specific allergens contributed to the disease to develop a serum to desensitize horses to the allergen and decrease the reaction. To determine the cause of the reaction, the researchers tested six horses without a history of respiratory disease and nine horses with equine asthma. Four different allergy tests were used on all horses including blood tests, skin tests, and inhalant tests. Unfortunately, there was no agreement among the tests as far as figuring out the specific cause of the allergy. Positive results on one test were negative on others, and tests on the normal horses showed positive. It is believed that positive skin tests may be related to local reactions of skin cells which do not correlate with allergies in the respiratory tract. The same problem has been discovered in human medicine with skin testing. Because of this, allergy testing is unlikely to be helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of horses with asthma.

Category: Chronic Progressive Lymphedema in Draft Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Chronic progressive lymphedema is a serious and difficult disease in draft horses, and is characterized by progressive swelling, increased thickness of the skin called hyperkeratosis and scarring of the distal limbs. The veterinary staff at UC Davis indicates the disease starts at an early age and progresses throughout the horse's life, which eventually leads to disfigurement and premature death. The disease and clinical symptoms are similar to a disease in humans called elephantiasis. The lower leg swelling is caused by abnormal functioning of the lymphatic system, which results in chronic swelling, scarring, decreased immunity and chronic infections of the skin. The disease starts out as small skin infections on the lower legs that are not uncommon, called scratches, and after clipping the long feathers many times the infection is much more severe than expected and large areas of the skin are thickened with crusts. Also, many of these horses have a mite calledChorioptesthat further increases the inflammation and infection. As the crusts and skin folds enlarge, large nodules can develop that cause mechanical difficulty in walking, and the infections continue to increase as they are usually resistant to antibiotics. Unfortunately, there is no cure for the condition and managing the condition is the most that can be expected. Treatment includes clipping the feathers off of the legs to allow for topical medication. Since the horses have large nodules and scarring on the lower legs, the blood supply is decreased, which makes it difficult to treat the skin infections. If you have a draft horse with this syndrome, ask your veterinarian about treatment options.

Category: Cutaneous Lymphangitis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Let’s talk about a disease called cutaneous lymphangitis. Dr. Alan Loynachan from the University of Kentucky says that the lymphatic system is an important part of the cardiovascular system; it consists of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen and the thymus. Although most of you are familiar with lymph nodes, tonsils and spleens, you may not realize there are small lymph vessels that carry lymph fluid that is formed when fluid loss occurs in tiny capillary beds during normal nutrient exchange.  This lymph fluid is carried to lymph nodes to be filtered and to detect microorganisms, toxins and foreign material.  After filtration, the lymph is then carried to large veins that return it to the heart. Lymphatic disease can occur when lymph vessels become inflamed, leaky, or blocked.  It’s why your lymph nodes swell up under your throat when you get a sore throat. Cutaneous lymphangitis in horses is inflammation of these lymph vessels of the horse’s skin, usually below the hock, that leads to a leg swelling commonly called big leg.  Generally, these horses not only have a swollen leg, but also have nodules on the skin that can abscess and cause lameness.  The disease is generally considered to be caused by keeping the horse in a dirty area, but I think many cases occur after biting flies transmit organisms.  It can also occur after lacerations on the lower legs get bacterial or fungal contamination.  Most horses respond to antibiotics, exercise, cold hosing of the legs, and topical treatment of the skin.  However, delayed treatment can lead to scar tissue and permanent swelling, so if your horse has a swollen leg, do not wait to call your vet.

Category: Flying Insect Allergy in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A lot of horses are allergic to flying insect bites.  Culicoides (a type of gnat), black flies, stable flies, horn flies, and mosquitos can all cause an allergic reaction in some susceptible horses.  Generally these horses have intense itching to the point they rub their hair out and this rubbing leads to skin damage, secondary infections, and chronic skin damage with thickened skin.  In horses, the effects are commonly seen on the entire horse but especially the neck, back and tail head while donkeys seem to have the problem only occur on the lower legs.  Dr. Susan White from the University of Georgia indicates in Equine Disease Quarterly that the distribution of the lesions depends on the biting characteristic of the insects involved.  However, most of these allergies in climates like that of Texas occur in the warmer months and are not a problem in the winter.  If your horse is still itching in the winter in Texas, it is likely another type of allergy involved. Urticaria, also called hives, is common with biting insects but can also occur as a reaction to any kind of allergy, even a food allergy. Treatment of the itching and hives centers around fly control and there are multiple options that can help, including sprays, wipe on products, fly sheets, face masks, fly predators, and feed-through fly control; the latter is a product that contains a pesticide not digestible by horses but that kills fly larvae in the manure. Some of these methods are more effective than others, depending on the type of fly involved, so speak to your veterinarian if you’re not sure what type of insects you’re dealing with. Dr. Amanda Adams from the University of Kentucky is working on a vaccine that targets an inflammatory chemical called il-5, which is involved in the allergic reaction to flies. Hopefully this vaccine will prove to be successful.

Category: Inhalant Allergies and Pruritus in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The most common cause of scratching and rubbing in horses in allergies to flying insects, which should be much decreased in winter due to less insects. So if your horse scratches and rubs in the summer but seems much better in the winter, the scratching is likely related to a flying insect allergy. However, if your horse is still scratching in winter, there are multiple other causes, such as allergies to pollen or food. In most horses with atopy or inhalant allergies, it begins as seasonal allergies but may progress to year round problems. Dr. Susan White from Georgia indicates in the Practitioner publication that atopy usually starts when the horse is less than 7 years old. These horses usually scratch the face, legs, neck, mane and tail. Food allergies can also occur but appear to be rare in horses. To diagnose a food allergy, limiting the diet to one type of forage for 4 weeks or longer may be required to make the diagnosis. Generally starting with grass hay is a good idea as alfalfa or peanut hay are more likely to be related to food allergy. Dr. White indicates that soy is a common ingredient in many commercial concentrate foods and is a common allergen. Sweet feeds or any feed with molasses is also a common allergen, so all of these feeds should be eliminated except grass hay, and then added in one by one to determine the offending feed. Although that sounds simple, it is not as diagnosing food allergies can be complicated. Other possible causes of itching in horses in the winter are biting and sucking lice, ringworm, bacterial infections, yeast infections or immune mediated disease so if your horse is itchy in winter, call your vet for an exam.

Category: Relief for Horses During Allergy Season
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Allergies are not uncommon in horses, especially this time of year, but there are options to help these horses. Allergies can affect the immune system, respiratory system, and the skin. If not treated, allergies can affect your horse’s performance and quality of life. Some allergic reactions are evident as mild cases of hives, while severe cases can make your horse miserable. Dr. Samuel White of Nottingham Trent University in England states in the publicationThe Horsethat the immune system is involved with the allergic response, and when the horse’s body is exposed to an allergen, a protein that includes antibodies called IgE is produced. IgE binds to cells in the body and releases inflammatory mediators that cause clinical signs like itching. Horses are exposed to all kinds of allergens in the hay, and some horses react to the noxious gases from the ammonia in urine, causing an allergic reaction. These types of allergies can affect the skin or respiratory tract. Decreasing the number of allergens to which horses are exposed can be done by removing horses from the barn when mucking out stalls. Spores from hay can travel a distance in the air, so storing hay in a different area or barn away from your horse can be helpful. Many affected horses will cough due to mucous secretion and narrowing of the airways. Soaking hay can be helpful in reducing dust for horses showing respiratory allergies. Skin allergies are very common this time of year due to insect bite hypersensitivity as some horses are reactive to the saliva of biting flies.Highly allergic horses may require body sheets as well as fly sprays to protect them from flies to which they may be sensitive. Ask your veterinarian if you have questions about allergies your horse may be suffering from.

Category: West Nile Vaccination Response from Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The American Association of Equine Practitioners indicates West Nile is a core vaccine, meaning all horses in the United States should be vaccinated for it. West Nile is transmitted by mosquitoes, causes neurological disease in horses, and has an overall death rate of 33% so it is important to vaccinate your horse for West Nile especially in areas with a heavy mosquito population. Today there are many companies that make West Nile vaccine, either alone as an individual antigen or in combination with other vaccines such as tetanus and encephalitis. The advantage of the combination vaccines is that the horses get less injections. The only disadvantage to combination vaccines is that if your horse has a reaction and you are giving multiple vaccines in the same injection, you will not know which vaccine caused the problem. However, a recent report in the Journal of Equine Veterinary Science indicates there may be another reason to give West Nile vaccine separately. Zoetis Animal Health performed a study by using over 300 horses that did not have titers to West Nile. Some were vaccinated with combination West Nile vaccines, and some with vaccines containing only West Nile; that group was given other vaccines at the same time but as a different injection. The horses given the West Nile vaccine separately had an antibody titer that remained higher for a longer period than horses receiving the combination vaccines. It is believed antigen interference decreased the response to West Nile in the combination products. It is not known if the decrease is significant but it seems to me giving West Nile vaccine separately from other vaccines is probably a good idea.

Category: Blood-related
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today we are going to discuss a condition that develops in newborn foals that causes the destruction of their red blood cells. The condition is called neonatal isoerythrolysis and although that sounds like a confusing term, it simply means that the foal's red blood cells are being destroyed. The mare has antibodies that can damage the foal's red blood cells, and the antibodies are absorbed in the colostrum when the foal nurses. These antibodies then destroy the foal's red blood cells and cause anemia. These foals become weak usually in the first 1 to 4 days of life, and their mucous membranes become pale and then develop a yellow color called icterus. If the problem is discovered before 24 hours of age, the foal must be stopped from nursing and fed an alternative food source. However, most of the time a foal is found to be sick after all the antibodies have already been ingested. Treatment of these foals sometimes requires a blood transfusion. Blood can by collected from the mare for transfusion, but it must be washed multiple times to remove the antibodies. Also, blood can be collected from another horse that is negative for the most common reactive blood types. It's a lot easier to prevent this syndrome than treat it. If a mare has had a foal develop this problem in the past, it is a possibility she could do so again. To determine if a future foal might be at risk for developing this condition, blood testing of the mare and stallion can be performed before the mare is even bred. Also, if the mare is already pregnant, the mare's blood can be tested for anti red blood cell antibodies by sending samples to the University of California at Davis.

Category: Cancer is a Cellular Delinquent
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Like people, our pets’ bodies develop cancer cells throughout their lifetime. In the lucky ones, these cells remain dormant and no malignancy ever grows; in others, the cells go mad systematically. The cellular delinquents bust past the body’s natural immune system, as though a gate was left open, burgeoning into abnormal cells. They do not surrender to a healthy cell’s programmed death, so the cellular delinquents multiply as they crowd out healthy cells. They don’t follow any rules and ignore signals that they are overfilling the place. For nourishment, they cause new blood vessels to form to supply them, which should be supplying healthy tissue. These marauding delinquents can grow anywhere in our pets’ bodies, just like us: lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, intestines, bone, blood, brain, skin, muscle, mouth, nail beds, and so on. What signs of cancer can we look for in our pets? They range from subtle to more obvious that something is going wrong. Signs of cancer can be similar to ones seen in other diseases, so don’t assume your pet has cancer if you see one. Also don’t assume that age alone is causing lethargy or lack of playfulness. If your pet has one or more of these signs, it’s time for a visit to the veterinarian: catching any disease process early is best because it’s easier to treat.  With cancer, early detection can sometimes make the difference between good health at a reasonable cost and an expensive illness that may include death.

Category: Sarcoid Skin Tumor Treatment in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The most common skin tumor in horses is the sarcoid, and although the tumor does not spread to other organs, it can invade surrounding tissues. There are six different types of sarcoids. Regardless of the type, all are reported to be related to the bovine papillomavirus as DNA of this virus has been found in 100% of sarcoids. This is the same virus that causes warts to develop on cattle, although all horses exposed to the virus do not develop sarcoids. To diagnose a sarcoid, a biopsy is required although in many cases, the diagnosis can be made by the appearance of the mass. Many different treatments for sarcoids are available depending on the location and size of the tumor, as well as the veterinarian's experience. Surgical excision can be used but it is important to remove a large area around the tumor to prevent recurrence. In many cases, this is not possible and the tumor that recurs can be larger than the initial tumor so surgical removal should be reserved for only certain cases. Cryotherapy or freezing of the tumor has been successful for sarcoids and seems to be effective, especially if the tumor's size is reduced by surgery before the freezing procedure. Several types of chemotherapy are used locally to treat sarcoids. Cisplatin can be injected into the tumor or can be formed into beads and the beads implanted into the tumor, as has fluorouracil (5-FU) when injected into tumors. Treatments such as BCG have been injected into the tumors to stimulate immunity and have been effective in some cases. There are also multiple topical medications that have been used to treat sarcoids successfully.

Category: Squamous Cell Carcinoma in a Horse's Eyelid
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The most common tumor on the horse’s eyelid is a squamous cell carcinoma; this is the same tumor than causes cancer eye in cattle.  Predisposing factors that increase the chance of this tumor occurring are similar to those in cattle, as horses lacking pigmentation around the eye or that have light-colored faces are more susceptible to these tumors due to UV light exposure.  The tumor can occur on the eyelids, cornea, or third eyelid and may initially appear as a small red inflamed area that will eventually enlarge and can cover the entire eye.  For this reason, it is important to monitor your horse’s eyes, especially those with white around their eyes, for small bumps on the eyelids, or tearing in one eye more than another. Many times, horses with small squamous cell carcinomas only have inflammation of the conjunctival tissue around the globe and the horse’s response may appear similar to dust allergies.  If your horse has an eye that seems to be affected, call your vet so they can take a biopsy to determine if an infection, dust or a tumor could be involved.  If a squamous cell carcinoma is diagnosed, multiple treatments are available including freezing the tumor, surgical removal, hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and injecting various chemotherapeutic agents.  One chemotherapeutic agent that is inexpensive and can be injected in the tumor is the chemical 5 fu.  A recent report out of Oklahoma State reveals this chemical can reduce the tumor size although it is unlikely to completely cure the tumor.  However, reducing the tumor may eliminate clinical signs and allow surgical removal or other treatment.  If your horse has inflamed areas in or around the eyes, a tumor could be involved so call your veterinarian.

Category: Blood Transfusions for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although blood transfusions in horse's are rarely needed, it can be needed in certain conditions that result in a loss of a large amount of blood, according to Dr. Rose Nolen Walston, an internist at the University of Pennsylvania. Blood transfusions in horses share a lot of similarities with humans but there are some differences; while humans have three main blood types, horses have seven blood groups, and each group also has one of seven different factors. This leads us to a mathematical possibility of 400,000 different blood types in horses. Because of this possibility, giving matched blood in horses is difficult. Fortunately, although transfusion reactions in humans are a big problem, only 10% of the horses contain alloantibodies that attack the foreign blood cells. Therefore, the chance of reaction with the first transfusion of a horse is low but a second transfusion can be a problem. However, a study revealed that when unmatched blood was transfused to a horse, the red blood cells lasted less than five days compared to a matched transfusion in which the blood cells lasted 33 days. So it is certainly better to cross match and transfuse matched blood but sometimes this is impossible in an emergency. The other difficulty with a blood transfusion in horses is collecting and storing the blood. Equine blood can only be stored for about a month and storing large amounts of blood can also be a problem. Horses that require a transfusion may need two to three gallons of blood, compared to a pint that people usually require, and that requires a lot of refrigerator space to store blood that only lasts one month.

Category: Equine Heart Health
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In general, the equine heart is a very healthy organ and is rarely a cause of disease. Horses don’t have human-style heart attacks but can have other heart issues. When there is a problem, it can be serious, such as a fatal cardiac arrhythmia after exercise. In Italy in 2011 an Olympic gold medal-winning horse suffered a fatal aortic rupture. Dr. Celia Marr, BVMS, MVM, Ph.D., DEIM, DipECEIM, FRCVS, an equine internal medicine specialist based in Newmarket, Suffolk, states that the horse’s heart is well adapted to its role as an athlete. A horse’s normal resting heart rate can be as low as 30 beats per minute but can increase to 250 beats per minute at a gallop. This means that at a gallop, your horse’s heart can pump over 60 gallons of blood per minute efficiently. Your horse’s heart can have variable heart rates depending on what’s happening with the rest of the body, and this is normal. Many older horses and horses in athletic shape have long pauses between beats. This may make you think there is a problem, but in most cases, there is not. The most common rhythm abnormality in horses is atrial fibrillation, an irregular and often very rapid beat, and unless you use your horse heavily, you may not even know it is present. Fortunately, horses do not die from atrial fibrillation and some horses will even self-correct the erratic rhythm. However, atrial fibrillation can be a cause of reduced performance and some horses require treatment. Horses can have heart murmurs, and most are not serious. However, any horse with a significant murmur needs a cardiac ultrasound to find the location and severity. Fortunately, cardiac problems that lead to sudden cardiac death are rare in horses.

Category: Heart Murmurs in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Heart murmurs are common in small dogs as they get older and until they get severe, murmurs are generally not a problem.  Heart murmurs in cats are far less common. Any murmur heard in a cat should be considered potentially significant and further testing is warranted.  Murmurs in horses are also uncommon, and Dr. Chris Navas discusses two of the most common types in Teva Remuda. In general, there are two types of murmurs that horses get and they are characterized by when they appear in the cardiac cycle.  Systolic murmurs occur after the first beat and diastolic murmurs occur after the second beat.  The most common diastolic murmur occurs in older horses and is related to aortic regurgitation. Generally, it is due to degeneration of the aortic valve.  If your veterinarian hears this murmur, it is important to check the horse’s pulse. If the pulse is bounding or really strong, the heart problem is likely fairly severe.  The reason this is important is that horses with severe aortic regurgitation are susceptible to ventricular arrythmias and other heart problems and could collapse, and likely injure a rider.  Most horses with this murmur live normal lives and have successful athletic careers, but it is important to know that they have this murmur. Another common murmur is systolic, which is heard on the horse’s left side and is the same one commonly found in small breed dogs. It stems from mitral regurgitation.  This murmur can lead to heart failure and cause exercise intolerance, increased respiratory effort, and increased heart rate followed by foam coming out of the horse’s nostrils. The foam is from fluid in the lungs.  So, it is important for your veterinarian to listen to your horse’s heart at every visit to check for a heart murmur.

Category: Heat Problems in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The UC Davis College of Veterinary Medicine indicated in their newsletter that horses are susceptible to problems in the heat and these problems are even more likely to occur in Texas than in California. Many equine events are scheduled in the summer and the triple digit heat can lead to problems such as dehydration, exhaustion, and heat stroke. During these events, all horses must be allowed access to water at all times including on the trailer or after a class at a show. You can't make a horse drink but you can offer hay, which will sometimes encourage the horse to drink; you can even soak the hay in water to increase water consumption. You can also add warm water to grain and make a gruel or mash. Adding electrolytes or even table salt to the feed can increase water consumption. The most important fact is to know how much water your horse is drinking and if it's not enough, contact a veterinarian before dehydration develops. Also, always provide as much shade as possible for your horse and don't tie it to the trailer out in the sun. Another good idea is to make sure to leave vents and windows open in trailers so as to allow cross ventilation, but a screen over the window is recommended. We have all seen horses traveling down the road with their heads out of the trailer windows, but horses can develop eye irritation and even corneal damage resulting from flying debris. Know the signs of overheating and fatigue in your horse. One symptom is a high respiratory rate that is persistent 10 to 20 minutes after resting. A change in attitude and alertness (mentation) and a decrease in energy indicate fatigue, and your horse should be allowed to rest.

Category: Toxins Can Cause Heart Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Fortunately, heart disease is not common in horses but when it does occur, it can be serious. Some heart disease in horses can be caused by toxins. Dr. Megan Romano is a toxicology resident at the University of Kentucky Diagnostic Lab and she indicates that a common poisoning occurs when horses are exposed to feed containing a compound called an ionophore. Ionophores are commonly used in cattle to increase feed efficiency and promote weight gain but are toxic to horses, and toxicosis occur when this ingredient is mistakenly added to horse feed or when a horse is allowed to eat cattle feed. Ionophore exposure causes heart failure in horses with poor performance and sometimes sudden death. Another heart toxicity is exposure to the blister beetles commonly found in alfalfa hay. If a significant amount of blister beetles are ingested, damage to the heart muscle can occur, which can be deadly. Exposure to an ornamental yew or taxus can also affect the horse's heart and all parts of the plant or toxic. Ingestion of just a small amount of the yew shrub can cause heart failure and death so you want to make sure a horse property does not have any yew or taxus shrubs that horses could consume. Some other plants that can affect the horse's heart include white snakeroot, rhododendrons, azaleas, laurels, and fetterbush. Also milkweed are wildflowers cultivated as ornamentals and these can also be toxic to a horse’s heart. Many of these plants are not palatable to horses when growing but may be consumed if baled in hay, so always inspect your hay and if you see unusual plants, get them checked out before feeding the hay.

Category: Viral Arteritis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine viral arteritis, or EVA, is a contagious disease of horses caused by a virus. Although not deadly, it can cause abortion in pregnant mares, death in young foals, and can become a persistent carrier in stallions. And although Standardbreds and warmbloods are the most common horses affected, we did have a quarter horse outbreak in six states in 2006 that concerned horse breeders. Transmission commonly occurs through direct contact with horses spreading the virus in their respiratory tract, but venereal transmission is a major concern on breeding farms as the virus can even be spread through chilled or frozen semen. Clinical signs of EVA infection include fever, depression, decreased appetite, swelling of the lower legs, scrotum and mammary area, hives, inflammation around the eyes, and sometimes nasal discharge. If a pregnant mare is exposed close to term, she may not abort but may have an infected foal who may develop a serious case of pneumonia. Foals also infected within a few months after being born can develop a severe pneumonia or intestinal infection. Colts and stallions can become life-long carriers of the virus. There is an EVA vaccine for horses that is safe and effective. However, since the vaccine can cause horses to test positive for the virus and it is impossible to determine if the horse is positive from vaccine or infection, all horses should be tested before being vaccinated. There is a lot of technical aspects as far as timing of vaccination depending on age and use of the horse, so careful consideration should be used before vaccinating your horses for EVA. Discuss the issues with your veterinarian.

Category: Dental Abnormality Frequency in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The Horse.com indicates the domestication of horses has led to an increase in dental disease and abnormalities. Before horses were domesticated, they spent 80% of their time walking and grazing. The Horse.com indicates these activities kept their tooth edges rounded off and decreased sharp edges. They used their teeth harder and longer when eating grass only compared to eating a pelleted feed, which is what many horses eat these days. To determine the prevalence of abnormalities, the group at the University of Queensland examined the skulls of 400 horses of all ages and determined that horses 11 to 15 years of age had the highest occurrence of dental disease. It is believed these problems developed from untreated minor abnormalities early in life, such as retained baby teeth, malaligned teeth, or pockets of infection. Their theory is that since most horses eat processed feeds that do not encourage proper tooth usage, minor dental disease becomes severe abnormalities. The article recommends increasing grazing to decrease dental abnormalities; increased grazing and time out of the stall and in the pasture is always a good idea. The article also recommends feeding on the ground to encourage the horse to chew more, which is okay as long as you are not in a sandy area because feeding horses on sandy ground will increase sand ingestion and can lead to sand colic. However, regardless of the amount of chewing, all horses need some dental care and the mouth should be examined every time your vet examines your horse. Many horses do not have severe abnormalities but can have small abnormalities that can affect their performance.

Category: Dental Disease of the Incisors and Canine Teeth in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Fairly recently a new condition has been documented that affects a horse’s incisors and sometimes the canine teeth called equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis, or EOTRH for short.  EOTRH occurs in aged horses and is characterized by resorption and destruction of the teeth and is painful.  The cause of the condition is unknown, although many believe stress and strain on the teeth contribute to the problem, whereas others believe a bacterial infection may be involved.  Although the cheek teeth can also be affected, the disease is uncommon and less severe in the cheek teeth.  Affected horses are in pain, have difficulty chewing, increased salivation, tend to pack feed in the mouth, and have a decreased appetite. When looking at the teeth, you will notice the gums are receding, swollen and inflamed. Feed may begin to accumulate between the teeth leading to further inflammation and infection.  Early diagnosis of the disease requires x-rays of the suspected teeth involved and later on, the dental structures appear enlarged due to inflammation and increased production of cementum on the affected teeth. As the disease progresses, affected teeth will become loose and infection develops around them. Unfortunately, most of these teeth will need to be extracted at some point as they are painful, and x-rays are certainly necessary before and after extraction.  Some cases can be managed initially with home care by removing food trapped between the teeth and brushing the affected teeth daily.  Since these are usually the incisors or front teeth that are affected, this can be done on most horses.  Make sure your veterinarian examines your horse’s teeth at every visit.

Category: Dental Needs Change as Horses Age
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dental disease is certainly a problem in older horses as many of them have fewer teeth; some have fallen out or were extracted, thus making chewing difficult.  Also, there is a problem that affects mostly the incisors or front teeth in horses, a disease called EOTRH that stands for equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis.  You can see why the acronym is used when referring to this disease.  But the main issue is the teeth begin resorbing and excess cementum is produced on their root.  As the condition progresses, the teeth become inflamed, infected and painful, which can lead to a decreased appetite.  This disease affects the front teeth. Horses graze by grasping grass with their front teeth and tearing it off, so horses with EOTRH may not be able to graze because of the pain, so they will lose weight. If they can’t graze, then hay is the best forage option. Underweight horses need at least two percent of their body weight per day in forage, which is about 20 pounds for a 1,000-pound horse.  The staff at Kentucky Equine Research says that long-stem alfalfa is a good option for underweight horses because of its higher protein and energy content; a soft leafy alfalfa works best for horses with dental disease.  If you are going to feed hay cubes, first soak them long enough to soften them.  Some of these horses will require a complete feed that does not require any forage. Adding vegetable oil to the diet can add extra calories without the risk of founder or colic. Lastly, horses with EOTRH need to have their teeth x-rayed by your vet as some may need to be extracted to decrease the pain.  If your horse’s front teeth appear abnormal at the gum line, call your vet for an exam.

Category: Dental Pulp from New Born Foals Help Orthopedic Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Arthritis, tendon and ligament injuries are common in equine athletes, and there are multiple treatments.  One of the newest treatments for these injuries is called regenerative medicine, which uses stem cells to aid in healing.  Typically, stem cells are available from three sources: the umbilical cord of foals; fat tissue; and bone marrow.  Dr. Alicia Berone from Ohio State indicates that fat and bone marrow can be obtained from a patient, processed, and placed back into the horse’s damaged tissue, but cell yield and quality can vary and both are invasive processes that can even lead to a risk of cardiac arrythmias.  Blood from the umbilicus can be obtained at foaling, processed for stem cells, frozen and stored for later use, but the owner has to pay for storage fees and the cells’ viability declines over time.The newest source of stem cells is from the mouth of foals that died at birth due to birthing complications, but were otherwise healthy.  The dental pulp is a ball of tissue below the gum line in newborn foals, and Dr. Bertone indicates it is the most primitive form of stem cell tissue and has the greatest potential for developing into bone, ligaments, blood vessels and more.  The dental pulp was recently tested in 20 lame horses with tendon or ligament issues or arthritis.  The dental pulp tissue was injected directly into the affected joint or soft tissue injury, while another 20 horses served as controls.  Results indicated horses with tendon and ligament issues responded very well as several became sound, and the horses with arthritis responded but just not as well.  The treatment seems to be effective for a long period as a follow-up owner survey revealed 83 percent of the horses were being ridden two years after the treatment.

Category: Infection Is a Possible Complication of Tooth Extraction in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English As horses get older, dental disease becomes a problem, so all horses should have a dental exam performed by your veterinarian twice a year when vaccinations are due.  Lots of older horses will develop cupped out and shortened teeth, tooth fractures, and periodontal disease because feed becomes packed between the teeth and can lead to infection.  All of these cases will cause horses’ teeth to become loose or mobile in the mouth, which is painful and requires extraction.  Most dental extractions can be performed by your veterinarian with the horse sedated and a local anesthetic to numb the nerves.  However, some extractions will require general anesthesia. An interesting study was performed by veterinarians in Germany concerning the use of antibiotics after extracting teeth in horses.  In small animal medicine, it’s controversial if antibiotics should be used after extractions as many small animal dentists do not recommend them in dogs and cats after teeth are extracted.  The study in Germany involved 20 horses with various teeth extracted and blood samples were taken during and after the procedure.  It was found that as soon as one minute after an incision was made in the gum, many horses had bacteria in their blood stream and that these bacteria could lead to infections of the heart valves or pneumonia.  The study revealed 90 percent of the horses had bacteria cultured from their blood at some point during the procedure, and all extracted teeth were cultured and found to have bacterial infections.  For this reason, it may be wise for your veterinarian to place your horse on antibiotics after extracting a tooth to prevent infection from the mouth spreading to other parts of the horse’s body.

Category: Long in the Tooth (An Old Horse Tale)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Never underestimate the old horse. His joints may be stiff, and his coat a bit rough. He may have lost or gained weight in odd places. But he knows things the fit youngsters don’t. But like anything worth having, the old horse takes work and care. What is “Old”? When we ask if a horse, human, or hedgehog is old, we aren’t asking about how many times they’ve rotated around the sun. We really want to know how active, healthy, and alert the individual is. We want to know if they can perform their usual tasks or if they have special medical needs, and we want to know how much longer they will be a part of our lives. Just like some humans run marathons well into “old” age and others retire much younger, some horses may be lame by ten years old while others are happily jumping fences or chasing cows well into their 20s or 30s. In general, horses are considered geriatric (old), starting in their late teens to early 20s. However, nowadays, many horses live well into their 30s. This means our equine partners are with us much longer, but it also means they need more care for a longer time. When it comes to horses living longer, two of the key advances in equine management have been dental care and the availability of senior feeds. What Do You Need to Know About Your Horse’s Teeth? Teeth come in two flavors: brachydont and hypsodont. Humans have brachydont teeth. Once our permanent teeth erupt, what is in our mouth is all there will be. Horses have hypsodont teeth. Their teeth don’t grow as they age, but they do continue a cycle of wear and eruption throughout the horse’s life. If you think of teeth like icebergs and the gum as the waterline, humans have about as much iceberg below the waterline (roots) as we have above (tooth crown). Horses start with more iceberg below than above. The tooth lies mostly below the gum line and then slowly floats upward as the animal ages until it is all gone. As they age, the iceberg slowly erupts into the mouth and melts (wears down) as time goes on. By the time a horse is “long in the tooth”,  there is, in reality, little tooth left. This is where dental care comes in. The answer to “Well, what happens to horses in the wild?” is simple. They die. They starve, colic, and/or are eaten by predators. Grinders vs. Chompers Ideally, to maximize tooth longevity, routine dental care should begin in early life and continue regularly. Unlike people, horses are grinders, not chompers. They don’t chew up and down but use a side-to-side-and-around, or elliptical (oval), motion. This elliptical chewing, combined with the constant eruption of teeth, wears the horse’s teeth in particular patterns, often leaving high-and-low spots and sharp, jagged edges. Filing these edges and points regularly (floating) throughout the horse’s life helps maximize the chewing life of the teeth. As your horse enters old age, saying “Ahhhhhh” for dental exams becomes even more important. Not only can regular dental care maximize comfort for your old horse, but a proper examination – by a veterinarian, under sedation, and with a full mouth speculum to hold the mouth open – can detect potential problems such as missing, loose, or infected teeth. These issues can make it harder for horses to properly chew hay or grass, leading to weight loss, choke (feed balling up and clogging the esophagus), andcolic. Even with regular care, you might notice signs of dental issues in your old horse between veterinary visits. Keep an eye out for weight loss; dropped clumps of poorly chewed hay or grass; long stems of hay or grass in the manure (yes, you should look at your horse’s poop every day; no, it’s not weird); goop from the nose or eye, especially on one side; or a nasty smell from the mouth or nose – horses shouldn’t have dragon breath. Any of these things could indicate a tooth, gum, or sinus problem. Your horse’s head is mostly sinus – yes, they really are airheads – and there are a number of places where the molars extend up into the sinuses. An infected molar can yield a sinus infection. Your equine veterinarian is a key part of a proper dental examination. While there are a number of non-veterinarian teeth floaters who have varying degrees of education about teeth, dental care - especially for an older horse - involves more body systems than just the teeth. As your horse ages, you may notice the stray molar in the manger or hear your veterinarian utter the word “extraction” from time to time. Why Bother With Dental Care? Learning about hypsodont teeth may lead you to think, “If my horse’s teeth are going to fall out anyway, why should I pay to have you float them?” The easy answer is you don’t want your horse to be in pain. You don’t want him to suffer infections. You don’t want to have to buy more expensive feed any longer than absolutely necessary. Expensive feed, you say? Yes, this brings us to the “What happens when my horse runs out of teeth?” question. Fortunately, when modern horses run out of tooth, they have options. There are a number of excellent, balanced senior feeds that are easy to chew or gum and digest. They can be used as a complete feed or to supplement hay or grass in horses that can still chew well. These feeds also help address the changing dietary needs of the older horse, who doesn’t need as much protein as a younger horse. Your veterinarian may also refer you to anequine veterinary dental specialistto help your older horse have the best quality of life possible.

Category: Oral Ulcers in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We recently had an equine case in our practice that was unusual and worthy of mentioning as I hope we can prevent other horses from developing this problem.  I was called out to see a horse that had a decreased appetite and seemed to just not feel well.  This horse had also developed laminitis about a month earlier due to being overweight and was on Butazolidin for pain relief as well as wooden shoes to control foot pain.  During our exam, we found numerous large ulcers in the horse’s mouth and on the tongue, which was probably decreasing the horse’s appetite and causing him to be depressed.  In this case, it was suspected the horse’s ulcers was due to the bute he was taking for pain.  He was receiving the paste and we feel he did not swallow the paste quickly enough and the drug damaged the mouth.  Bute is a common drug in horses, the paste form is common, and we have used it for years and never had a problem.  However, it can cause ulcers in the mouth, so if you use bute paste, make sure the horse swallows the paste immediately and it is not retained in the mouth.  It might even be a good idea to flush the mouth with water about 5 minutes after it is given to prevent damage to the oral cavity. There are certainly other causes of oral ulcers, including grass awns from foxtail grass or other objects in the hay, viral diseases, and immune mediated diseases.  There is a concern about objects in the hay particularly when there is a drought and people have to feed some hay that may be lower quality.  Always check any new hay you buy carefully before feeding it to your horses.

Category: Slobbers in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A scary sight for a horse owner is to walk into the stall and see large amounts of saliva pouring from the horse’s mouth.  There are certainly several causes for this, such as choking or a blocked esophagus, exposure to certain insecticides, inability to swallow, or inflammation of the oral cavity. However, maybe the most common cause of excessive salivation is a condition appropriately called slobbers.  Slobbers occurs when a horse ingests pasture, hay, or silage that contains a fungus that is commonly found in soil and transmitted in seeds.  The fungus produces a mycotoxin called slaframine that produces the clinical signs of excessive salivation.  Other clinical signs include diarrhea, excessive tearing, frequent urination, stiffness, abortion, loss of appetite, bloating, and even death.  However, most cases simply have excessive salivary production that stops 24 hours after removing the infected hay. The fungus can be seen growing on the plants. Dr. R.H. Poppenga from U.C. Davis indicates the infection begins as a black to bronze patch on the leaves, usually on their underside.  The fungus will eventually spread and cover the entire plant, killing the plant.  Symptoms in animals eating the plants will depend on the concentration of the fungus.  The fungus is most commonly noted on red clover but can be found on many other plants including white clover, soybean, blue lupine, cow pea, alsike clover, and alfalfa.  If your horse is salivating excessively, it could just be due to fungus in the hay.  However, there also could be other problems such as botulism, so a vet exam is recommended.

Category: Vesicular Stomatitis in Horses and Cattle
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Vesicular stomatitis was in the news again this year. It is a viral disease that affects primarily horses and cattle, and it causes blisters and sores on the tongue, lips, muzzle, nose, hooves, and teats. The major concern with this disease is not the damage it causes but that the sores and lesions resemble foot and mouth disease, a serious foreign animal disease. In mid-May of 2015, three horses in Texas's Pecos County, about 30 miles north of Fort Stockton, Texas, were found to be infected with vesicular stomatitis. Samples were sent to the veterinary lab in Ames, Iowa, and they confirmed the diagnosis. In most cases, vesicular stomatitis is not a serious disease as most animals recover with supportive care. However, the disease is quite contagious and consequently in Texas and some other states affected animals are required to be quarantined as it can be readily transmitted by flies or direct contact. The disease commonly occurs in the warmer months of the year and is not uncommon in the south and west Texas area, as it seems we see a few cases every couple of years. Vesicular stomatitis can also affect people and can cause flu-like symptoms of fever, weakness, and muscle aches. The first case this year of vesicular stomatitis was found in late April in New Mexico. Since quarantine is involved, this can have an effect on movement of animals into and out of quarantined areas and states; before moving any animals, be sure to contact your local veterinarian for advice and a health certificate. Again, the major concern with vesicular stomatitis is not the disease itself but that it can cause similar symptoms to foot and mouth disease, which is very serious and could cause the diagnosis to be missed.

Category: Wolf Teeth in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Not all horses have wolf teeth. About 15% of males and 25% of females have been found to have these teeth, so fillies have them more commonly than stud colts. Most of the wolf teeth are found on the upper arcade of mouth but they can also be seen on the lower one.  Most horse people have heard of wolf teeth but many believe these they are the large teeth directly behind the front or incisor teeth, but this is not the case as those are canine teeth, which are more common in male horses.  The wolf teeth cannot be seen by looking at the teeth at the front of the horse’s mouth. They are small teeth located at the front of the large cheek teeth and are about 4-5 inches deep in the horse’s mouth from the front teeth.  Because of this, the horse’s mouth generally needs to be opened to determine if the horse has them. Wolf teeth are commonly extracted because it is believed by some that these teeth interfere with a bit and can cause pain by pressing the gum into the tooth when pulling on the bit.  However, there is no scientific evidence that the bit causes pain with wolf teeth, so this is just one of those procedures that have been passed down for centuries and we are still doing it today.  These teeth were even extracted in the middle ages because it was believed they made the horse develop blindness and madness.  Regardless of the lack of scientific evidence indicating extraction is necessary, many owners and trainers want to remove wolf teeth to make sure they are not causing a decrease in performance.  To remove the teeth, your veterinarian will sedate the horse and inject a local anesthetic to numb the teeth prior to extraction.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine canker is an uncommon but serious problem that can affect a horse’s foot.  Thrush is a bacterial infection that affects the horse’s frog and causes a black, foul-smelling discharge and results in deteriorated tissue.  Although canker is also an infectious process caused by bacteria, it causes abnormal growth of tissue in the frog that resembles off-white cauliflower in color and texture, so these conditions are very different even though canker can also have a foul odor.  Lots of folks assume their horses have thrush and treat for it when canker is the real problem. Thrush treatment will have no effect as canker needs to be treated with surgery. Although canker can be diagnosed on clinical appearance, sometimes a biopsy is needed.  The infective and proliferative tissue must be surgically removed with a scalpel blade. The procedure can be done while the horse is standing after numbing the foot with a local anesthetic and applying a tourniquet to control bleeding.  After removing the infected tissue, the surgical site should be frozen with cryotherapy to remove all adjacent surface bacteria. Then the veterinarian will apply an astringent dressing with antibiotics and bandage the foot until the tissue is cornified and healed.  It is critical to keep the foot absolutely dry, so the horse must be kept in a dry covered stall with shavings that will absorb moisture.  Although we do not know the cause of canker, Dr. Steve O’Grady indicates it does not appear to be caused by unsanitary conditions as most of the horses he sees with the condition are well managed.

Category: Carbon Dioxide Wound Therapy in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the newest ways to treat equine wounds is carbon dioxide therapy. However, the effectiveness of the treatment in horses is questionable. Dr. Angela Gaesser, DVM, DACVS-LA, from the University of Pennsylvania, said at a convention of the American Association of Equine Practitioners that carbon dioxide therapy does not appear to speed wound healing in horses but might decrease the size of the wound. Carbon dioxide has shown promise in humans with chronic wounds due to diabetes. However, lower limb injuries in horses are difficult to heal due to skin tension, lack of underlying soft tissue, and the high motion of the legs, which leads toexcessive granulation tissue, calledproud flesh. In a blind study on wound healing and skin graft acceptance in horses, six horses with small and large wounds on the forelegs were monitored for healing over a period of 28 days. In a course of 11 treatments, the horses received carbon dioxide applied to one leg for 20 minutes, while the control leg was only treated with room air. After one week of treatment, 10 skin grafts were applied to the large wounds. All wounds were examined on the 28th day. The amount of healing, the presence of proud flesh, and biopsies were looked at. Results showed there was no difference in the rate of healing between the carbon dioxide-treated wounds and those treated with room air. The study showed there was also no difference in skin graft acceptance rates as skin grafts were successful in wounds treated with room air or carbon dioxide.

Category: Chronic Hoof Abscesses in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hoof abscesses are common in horses and many horses will develop an abscess at some point in their lives.  Most abscesses occur when the feet are not trimmed correctly or often enough, and a space develops at the junction of the wall and sole called the white line that allows dirt and bacteria to enter the hoof capsule.  Abscesses can also occur when your horse steps on an object that penetrates the sole, like a mesquite thorn, but this is less common.  Generally, these abscesses are easily treated by your veterinarian and competent farriers and they respond to treatment. However, if your horse continually develops hoof abscesses or does not respond to treatment, there must be an underlying problem.  I have heard folks say it required 3 months to a year for an abscess to resolve and if this is the case, there is another underlying problem involved.  Laminitis is a common cause of recurrent abscesses as is infection of the coffin bone.  Another cause of recurrent abscesses is a mass called a keratoma that can form around the coffin bone and between the bone and the hoof wall or between the bone and the sole.  These masses can usually be found on an X-ray as a defect in the bone as the mass presses on the bone.  However, Dr. Sammy Pittman indicates in the Remuda Magazine that sometimes a venogram is helpful in identifying these masses.  Surgical removal is the only treatment option for the keratomas and many times a large portion of the hoof wall must be removed to locate and surgically remove the keratoma or a large portion of the sole may need to be removed.  So, if you have a horse with recurrent or non-healing abscesses, there is an underlying problem and X-rays will be required to determine the underlying cause.

Category: Decreased Sweating in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the problems many horses face during the summer is the inability to sweat, a condition called anhidrosis. It is believed to be related to horses' lack of acclimation to hot and humid weather, but Dr. Ben Buchanan indicates inTheRemuda,a quarterly publicationof the Texas Equine Veterinary Association, that the condition develops in horses native to warmer climates, such as Texas, just as often as those imported from cooler areas. Anhidrosis is reported to affect horses up to 20 percent in the southern United States and is more common in younger horses. Sweating is the manner horses cool themselves, and while it is under hormonal and nervous system control, little is known about why this happens to some horses and not to others. It is thought excessive stimulation down-regulates the receptors and just basically wears them out so that no sweat is produced. Some mildly affected horses will exhibit poor performance, while many seriously affected horses have a high temperature and are breathing rapidly to try to cool themselves. A sweat test is used to diagnose the condition. Mildly affected horses can be worked in cooler parts of the day, and keeping them under fans and misters can be helpful. Discuss with your veterinarian possible treatments and other ways to make a horse diagnosed with anhidrosis more comfortable.

Category: Differences in Horse Sweat
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have any experience with exercising horses, you know horses sweat a lot. And this is a good thing because sweating is the major method that horses use for cooling themselves in hot and humid weather, and after exercising. Dr. Peter Huntington from Kentucky Equine Research in Australia indicates that other than horses, the only mammalian species that sweat enough to cool themselves are humans and one species of monkey. However, human sweat is high in protein and low in electrolytes while equine sweat is low in protein and very high in electrolytes, so horses lose a large amount of electrolytes when they sweat. That's why working horses need to be supplemented with electrolytes all year round, and especially in hot weather. Sometimes horse sweat seems thin and watery while other times it seems thick and foamy; the thick and foamy sweat contains a protein called latherin. Latherin is a detergent-like protein that helps move sweat away from the skin to the surface of the coat, and once the coat gets damp, there is a greater opportunity for evaporative cooling. Latherin causes foaming of sweat in places of contact where tack rubs the coat such as under the saddle, and where body parts rub together such as between the upper thighs. Dr. Huntington indicates that to keep your horse's skin and hair coat in the best condition, all sweat should be removed from the coat as soon as possible. In warm weather, rinsing the horse with water removes the sweat and helps to cool him off. If the sweat is allowed to dry without rinsing, a curry comb and brush can remove dried sweat. Removing it is a good idea because an accumulation of dried sweat, even for only a few days, can be damaging to the coat.

Category: Honey Used for Horse Wounds Should Be Medical Grade
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses have fairly thin skin for the size of the animal, so lacerations are common.  Numerous materials have been used to heal horse wounds and some aid in healing and many actually decrease healing.  One product that has shown promise in treating horses’ wounds is medical grade honey, which is different than the honey you have in your refrigerator for human consumption.  Medical grade honey has been sterilized by gamma radiation to eliminate any naturally occurring bacteria and it appears to improve healing rates in naturally sustained wounds. Dr. Gal Kelmer said in The Horse that veterinarians have seen improved healing after applying medical grade honey to wounds before suturing as decreased infection was noted at time of suture removal.  A study in which all veterinarians involved were to repair wounds in the normal manner except some were to apply medical grade honey in the wounds prior to suturing and the others were not.  The study involved 127 horses, 69 of which were treated with medical grade honey. Their lacerations were anywhere from 1 inch long to 15 inches long on multiple areas of the horse’s body.  The major difference in healing appeared to be due to the non-healing wounds developing infections and the fully healed wounds were not infected.  Results indicated 50% of the honey-treated horses healed completely while only 31% of the non-treated horses healed completely before suture removal.  Honey’s natural antibacterial properties likely contributed to the improved healing by warding off infections without the concern of antibiotic resistance developing as it appears bacteria do not develop resistance to medical grade honey.

Category: Inhalant Allergies and Pruritus in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The most common cause of scratching and rubbing in horses in allergies to flying insects, which should be much decreased in winter due to less insects. So if your horse scratches and rubs in the summer but seems much better in the winter, the scratching is likely related to a flying insect allergy. However, if your horse is still scratching in winter, there are multiple other causes, such as allergies to pollen or food. In most horses with atopy or inhalant allergies, it begins as seasonal allergies but may progress to year round problems. Dr. Susan White from Georgia indicates in the Practitioner publication that atopy usually starts when the horse is less than 7 years old. These horses usually scratch the face, legs, neck, mane and tail. Food allergies can also occur but appear to be rare in horses. To diagnose a food allergy, limiting the diet to one type of forage for 4 weeks or longer may be required to make the diagnosis. Generally starting with grass hay is a good idea as alfalfa or peanut hay are more likely to be related to food allergy. Dr. White indicates that soy is a common ingredient in many commercial concentrate foods and is a common allergen. Sweet feeds or any feed with molasses is also a common allergen, so all of these feeds should be eliminated except grass hay, and then added in one by one to determine the offending feed. Although that sounds simple, it is not as diagnosing food allergies can be complicated. Other possible causes of itching in horses in the winter are biting and sucking lice, ringworm, bacterial infections, yeast infections or immune mediated disease so if your horse is itchy in winter, call your vet for an exam.

Category: Insect Bite Allergies Helped by Omega 3 Fatty Acids in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When the weather gets warmer the number of flying insects increases, and many horses are allergic to insect bites.  Horses that are allergic to insect bites have a significant reaction that causes them to scratch and rub their skin, and they are very uncomfortable.  Some will scratch and rub enough to lose hair and even develop severe skin infections. All of this is commonly called sweat itch.  The lesions commonly occur on the midline of the horse’s belly but can occur over the back as well as the main and tail areas.  Treatment of the condition requires insect control, sometimes cortisone to decrease the allergic response, and antibiotics if the horse has an infection.  However, cortisone can only be used short term and it can lead to founder, so it is not a good option in the long term. Another option for the allergy may be omega 3 fatty acid supplementation.  This therapy is used in dogs with allergies; researchers at the University of Guelph indicated they tested horses using flaxseed, which is a good source of omega 3 fatty acids.  Horses were fed flax meal daily for six weeks and then some were injected with Culicoides extract, which is one of the flies typically involved with the syndrome.  The horses that were fed the flax meal had a significant reduction in skin reaction compared to horses that weren’t.  If your horse has skin allergies to flying insects, feeding omega 3 fatty acids may help.  The only concern I have about the study is that the horses used were not reported to be allergic to flying insects so although the itching decreased, so I don't know if feeding flax seed will make a significant difference in itchy horses but it is worth a try.

Category: Novel Bioelectric Wound Healing Device in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The lower limb injuries common in horses are often difficult to heal because the lower legs have decreased blood supply and increased tension.  Also, proud flesh - a pinkish granulation tissue that keeps growing over a wound until the tissue bulges above skin level and newly formed skin cannot grow over the wound - is a major problem in equine lower leg wounds that delays or even prevents healing.  There are many different methods for treating these injuries, including bandaging, casting, and the use of many different topical medications.  Every veterinarian has their favorite topical medication, which indicates that many methods are effective in getting these wounds to heal.  A veterinarian from California reported on a new method of treating these wounds by the use of a bioelectric device placed on the wound under a wrap.  The device is a pad containing zinc and silver called Procellera and the ingredients are placed in a dot matrix pattern which creates tiny microbatteries on the surface of the wound.  The manufacturers say an electrical signal increases wound healing, and that zinc and silver are antimicrobial and help with wound healing. No external power is required as it is bioelectric. It produces a sustained voltage on the wound surface.  The pads are applied with gauze and tape and changed every three to four days.  The manufacturer indicates this device decreases proud flesh, healing time, and pain from the wound; there are multiple successful cases presented in the Journal of Equine Veterinary Science.  The device seems to be helpful in healing although there are no controls used in the studies to show how a similar laceration would heal when treated in the same manner without the bioelectric device.  However, if your horse has a non-healing wound on the leg, this bioelectric device could be used as an option.

Category: Pastern and Heel Dermatitis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A common syndrome seen in horses is inflammation of the skin at the area of the heel and pastern just above the horse's foot. This is called pastern and heel dermatitis but has also been called scratches, and there can be many different causes. One of the major factors is that the skin gets wet while walking in grass and being damp, especially if hair is long in this area, and causes the skin to be damaged. Inflammation and infection can develop that can be extremely painful. Scabs and crusts form in the area that further increase the pain. These cases may look simple but can be difficult to treat and your veterinarian should be contacted. Cultures of the area should be performed to determine if bacteria or fungi are involved and a skin scraping should be performed to check for parasites that can also be involved. Treatment of the condition involves removing all the hair from the area and then removing all the scabs. These scabs can be firmly attached to the skin and removal can be extremely painful so sedation may be required. Removal works best by soaking the area in antibacterial scrub solution for several minutes and then carefully removing the scabs. Initially, these horses need to be treated with an antibiotic cream with cortisone to reduce the inflammation and kill the infection. Wrapping the area keeps the ointment in contact with the skin and helps reduce the inflammation. After the inflammation and pain are reduced, wrapping the area is not required as this keeps the area too moist. Topical application of cortisone-antibiotic ointment is used only as needed to keep the inflammation under control but allows healing to occur. Oral antibiotics are also indicated in many cases.

Category: Pastern Dermatitis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A condition called scratches is also called mud fever as well as other names, but the actual name is equine pastern dermatitis, even though it can occur further up the leg than the pastern. It is commonly seen on the back of the horse's pastern area and at the front of the cannon bone on the rear legs. When feeling the affected area, you will feel small bumps on the skin. These are scabs with infection underneath and are usually due to some type of irritation. The scabs are very painful to remove and although there are multiple causes, the most common cause I believe is allergies, especially to flying insects like mosquitoes. Regardless of the cause, something irritates the skin and leads to an infection and a scab. To treat the condition, all hair should be removed carefully with clippers to avoid further irritation and all scabs should be gently removed. As mentioned, removing these scabs is painful and many horses will require your veterinarian to sedate them for scab removal. I usually soak the scabs by shampooing with an antibacterial shampoo and leave that on the skin for 15 minutes. This will soften the scabs and make removal much easier. The antibacterial shampoo can be used daily or every other day to kill infection and prevent scabs from forming. After the scabs are removed, topical treatment with an antibiotic and steroid cream is used to kill the infection and prevent more scabs from forming. If the infection is severe, oral antibiotics may be needed. Using a shampoo and ointment containing chlorhexidine is effective as it is antibacterial and antifungal. Preventing scratches involves keeping the legs dry, and if flying insects are the underlying cause, control those.

Category: Pastern Dermatitis in Horses Caused by Mites
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pastern dermatitis is a fairly common condition, especially in draft horses and other horses with feathers on their legs. This condition is caused by many factors, including allergies, but one cause is a skin mite that causes inflammation and leads to infection. The mite can be found on many farm animals so other animals can be a source. One treatment thought to be effective was using a dewormer like ivermectin or Quest. To test this theory, Quest was used in a group of horses known to be infected with mites; Quest was chosen because it is in the tissue longer than ivermectin. All horses were treated orally on day zero and again on day 21. The stalls were cleaned and disinfected on day zero and again on day 14. They also used a placebo group that was not treated with Quest but the stalls were cleaned. Results indicated that the group of horses treated with Quest still had just as many mites on the legs as those not treated at all. So if you have a horse with pastern dermatitis caused by mites on the legs, treating with Quest and ivermectin are unlikely to be helpful. Although owners do not like the horse's feathers clipped, this is critical in most cases to kill the mites by using lime sulfur dip or frontline spray topically on the legs. Most of these horses also need to be on systemic antibiotics as well as topical antibiotics, and topical steroids to reduce the inflammation. Pastern dermatitis is a serious condition that can cause scarring and chronic infection on the legs that can lead to chronic pain and lameness.

Category: Pastern Lacerations in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Over the last two weeks at our practice, we have seen four horses with lacerations of the pastern area.  The pastern is the area between the hoof and the fetlock joint. The most common area that is lacerated is the back side of the pastern.   Unfortunately, none of these horses were presented immediately as the owners tried to treat them without veterinary advice.  This is a difficult area to heal because every time the horse takes a step, the laceration on the back of the pastern opens and closes.  Instability of a wound makes healing very difficult, so it is important to stabilize these wounds for healing to occur. Obviously, any wound in this area must be examined carefully by a vet to make sure a joint or tendon sheath is not involved as these structures are commonly injured in this area.  Sedation and local anesthesia is usually required to thoroughly examine these wounds.  If none of these structures are involved, all of these wounds must be wrapped with a pressure bandage.  It is not possible, in my opinion, to heal a wound in this area correctly without at least a pressure bandage.  Topical antibiotics are applied to the wound and the bandage is changed every day for several days.  The best method of treating a wound in this area is by using a cast to prevent movement.  Although a cast is more expensive, these wounds heal much quicker under a cast and actually may cost less long term.  If the wound is fresh and can be sutured, a cast should be applied to stabilize the wound or the sutures will likely not hold.  If your horse gets cut in the pastern, wrap the wound initially and contact your vet to examine the wound.

Category: Preventing and Controlling Mange in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Everyone has heard of mange in dogs but horses can also develop it too, although not as commonly as dogs. Mange basically means a disease caused by mites, but there are many different types of mites. The most severe type of mange in horses is sarcoptic mange due to the severe itching and scratching it causes. The mites cause intense scratching and rubbing on objects like fences or stall walls, and initial lesions usually occur on the head, neck and shoulders. Hair loss and crusts develop on the skin followed by severe skin damage and thickening of the skin. If untreated, the skin disease will spread over the entire body and can lead to decreased appetite and general weakness. The mites can usually be found by scraping some skin tissue and looking for the mites under the microscope. A similar type called psoroptic mange can also occur but horses usually develop lesions in the fetlock and mane, around the tail, between the hind legs or under the front legs, and even the ears. Treatment of both types is the same including topical insecticides, lime sulphur dip, or oral ivermectin. These mites are contagious to other horses and humans so take precaution to decrease spread of mites and treat all contact animals. Another type is chorioptic mange or leg mange, which affects the lower legs of draft horses or any horses with heavy feathers in the fetlock region. Secondary infection is common and in most cases, the hair will need to be clipped and topical insecticides applied to kill the mites as well as antibiotics to kill the infection. If your horse is itching or rubbing on objects or has a chronic skin condition, contact your veterinarian as mange is a possibility.

Category: Pythiosis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on the program I am going to talk about an uncommon skin infection in horses called pythiosis, or phycomycosis, that does occur in Texas.  Dr. Susan White from the University of Georgia indicates these are not true fungi but are actually plant pathogens that cause disease in horses.  Most of the time, this occurs when horses have small cuts or scrapes on the skin and they become infected standing in stagnant water or wet grass.  The disease is most commonly found in the Gulf Coast states and most lesions are on the horse’s legs or under the belly. After infection, the lesions quickly enlarge and drain pus and bloody fluid. They are nasty lesions.  Because they can look like other infections, it is important for your vet to take a piece of the tissue to get an accurate diagnosis.  One unusual characteristic is these lesions contain little hard calcified masses called kunkers.  Unfortunately, these cases are difficult and some horses have to be euthanized if the lesions are too advanced to treat.  If the lesions are found early, they can be removed surgically but many times the lesion will recur.  Antifungal medications are not effective since these organisms are not true fungi.  There is a vaccine produced by Pan American Veterinary Labs in Hutto, Texas, that has shown good success in early cases of pythiosis and even some response in chronic cases. If your horse has a rapidly growing skin lesion that is not responding to normal wound treatment, contact your vet as soon as possible because early cases of pythiosis have a much better prognosis than ongoing cases.

Category: Rain Scald and Ringworm in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hair loss and lesions on the horse's skin are common and one of the most common is ringworm. Ringworm is not a worm but actually a fungal infection that is contagious between horses and these infections can be spread between horses by tack such as halters and saddle pads. Lesions can occur anywhere on the horse but I usually see them initially on the neck area. They appear as small crusted areas without hair and will sometimes appear in a ring pattern. Horses with ringworm may be itchy and will be seen rubbing the affected areas on the fence or stall. To diagnose ringworm, a fungal culture is required and this is important because other diseases look similar and require different treatments. One of these similar diseases is rain scald. Rain scald is a bacterial disease that also forms crusts but the crusts are usually thicker than those with ringworm. Rain scald is caused by the bacteria Dermatophilus and is usually seen in the fall and winter. Your vet can diagnose rain scald by plucking some scabs from the skin and examining them under the microscope. Treatment of rain scald involves removing the scabs by soaking them with an antibacterial scrub and allowing them to soften. Some of these scabs can be tightly attached so some patience is required. The infection responds to penicillin injections or oral trimethoprim sulfa antibiotics. On the other hand, if ringworm is involved, treatment involves shampooing with an antifungal shampoo or lime sulfur dip, so contact your vet if your horse has a skin problem. Getting a correct diagnosis is better for the horse and less expensive for the horse owner than guessing at the diagnosis and buying an ineffective product at the feed store.

Translating Return to English One of the most common skin conditions I see in horses is called urticaria. It consists of small, one to five-inch raised lesions on the horse's skin. Urticaria is not a disease in itself, but it is a clinical sign. The lesions are typically edematous, meaning the tissue is filled with fluid. It is likely you have seen these lesions on a horse. They seem to appear quickly and when you press on the lesions or bumps, your fingertip will make an indention into the swollen area; this indentation tells you the swelling is due to edema, or fluid, in the tissue. Lesions are more common on the neck and thorax (the part of the body between the neck and the abdomen) and if the condition is severe, multiple smaller lesions can form into a group and make the lesions appear to be quite large. Some of the lesions will even have small amounts of fluid or serum oozing out. Sometimes horses will be rubbing the lesions as if they itch, but most do not. The most common cause of these lesions in horses is an allergy to flying insects or to another environmental allergy, although ringworm can cause similar reactions in horses that are allergic to the ringworm fungi. There are some other infections of immune conditions that can cause urticaria, but these are uncommon. In cases that do not respond to regular treatment, a biopsy may be required to diagnose some of these other unusual conditions. Because the most common treatment for urticaria is cortisone, it is important to rule out ringworm before using long-term cortisone because ringworm can worsen if cortisone is used. As far as treatment, many cases do not require treatment at all and horses will recover without it. However, if the problem continues or worsens, cortisone treatment is recommended. Allergy testing can be performed in cases that recur to determine the cause of the allergy.

Category: Serious Lower Leg Wounds in Horses and Donkeys
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We had a client call last week about a horse with an injury to the lower leg and she emailed pictures of the wound.  This horse had a wound at the hock joint that occurred one week prior and was draining lots of material, and she wanted to know if the horse should be seen or not. The horse was not putting weight on the leg.  We said the horse had to be seen. Horses and donkeys commonly develop wounds that heal without a lot of problems, but lower leg wounds are different that other wounds.  Horses have many synovial structures that are prone to injury on the lower legs, including joints and tension sheaths that are near the surface of the skin, and horses have relatively thin skin compared to the size of the animal.  A small half-inch nail or piece of wire in the wrong location can enter a tendon sheath or joint, and just a tiny puncture there is enough to create an infection.  Although these lower leg wounds may not look very severe, they can be extremely serious and even deadly. Because of this possibility, any lower leg wound should be seen by a veterinarian immediately. This includes injuries to the foot like a nail or thorn in the foot.  If an infection enters the tendon sheath or joint, immediate care is required to treat the condition.  Some of these cases require referral to a specialist to flush out the joint and tendon sheath, and look inside the structures with an endoscope.  Long-standing joint or tendon sheath infections usually lead to chronic lameness and sometimes cannot be resolved leaving the horse to suffer with chronic pain. So, if your horse or donkey develops a lower leg wound, it is not a good idea to only treat it topically and see what happens because the risk is quite high that you may be dealing with a serious wound.  An initial exam by your vet may save your horse’s life.

Category: Skin Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many equine skin diseases appear similar to the eye. Some horses will develop small swollen areas on the skin with hair loss. There are many different possible causes for this, one of which is ringworm. Ringworm is a fungal infection that causes inflammation and hair loss with itching and rubbing on the skin. Ringworm is contagious to people so it is important to determine if ringworm is involved, especially if your horse is around children as they are quite susceptible. Horses can be exposed to ringworm from other horses, cats, and even the soil.Generally, ringworm has circular lesions and the horses do not itch a lot but I have seen horses with it that itch quite a lot. Ringworm lesions can also look similar to other skin infections, such asStaph, and it is important to determine which infection is involved as ringworm is a fungus andStaphis a bacteria and they require different treatments.  There are lots of antifungal products over the counter that claim to be effective but most are not proven to be effective so it is important to know the correct disease you are treating.  Diagnosing fungal infection requires hairs and flakes taken off the edge of the lesion be sent to the lab for culture which may require up to 2 weeks.  There is a new PCR fungal test that only requires a few days but the test is not fully tested in horses.Most of theseStaphinfections respond to antibiotics but resistant staph infections like MRSA do develop in horses, so any skin lesions that don't respond to antibiotic treatment should be cultured to determine if the horse has resistant infection. Flying insect allergies can also appear similar to infections as allergic horses develop raised bumps with hair loss and this can lead to secondary infections. The most common flying insect allergy is to a tiny midge called culicoides, and the horse is allergic to the proteins in the insect's saliva and causes an allergic reaction. Horses can also develop skin lesions from environmental allergies like dust, mold, and pollen as well as a contact allergy to certain chemicals. These allergies can also cause lumps on the skin, and after the horse rubs and scratches those lumps, infections develop. So there are lots of causes of lumps and bumps on the horse's skin and many of them require different treatments. Before buying an over-the-counter skin treatment, have your vet take a look and make the diagnosis before starting treatment. Bacterial infections are also common on horse’s skin especially secondary to fly bites or other types of allergy that causes trauma.  Although many of these infections are related to staph infection some are not and so it is recommended to culture infected areas to know which antibiotic to use. Going into the winter, one problem is caused by lice.  Lice are fairly large parasites that can actually be seen with the naked eye if you have really good vision.  However, if there are only a few lice on the horse, using a lice comb is a good idea.  If your horse is itching, use a lice comb and add a drop of oil on the teeth which aids in capturing the parasites.  You can use a low power microscope or magnifying glass to visualize the lice and it has been reported that it is better to examine the horse after being worked as lice move to the tips of the hairs and are easier to find after working.

Category: Skin Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses commonly have hair loss in various areas and sometimes the cause can be difficult to determine.  Hair loss and skin disease in horses can be caused by multiple conditions.  One of the more common conditions we see is called scratches, which is commonly found on the rear legs at the front part of the cannon bone.  These horses will have hair loss in some instances and scabs.  Some horses will also have swelling on the legs in this area and inflammation down around the pastern area. There are many different causes of this condition and I believe a lot of horses develop these lesions due to allergy or flies affecting the lower legs. It may also be related to irritation from horses walking through tall grass or weeds, but something must irritate the area to start the process. Then infection develops.  The infection may be bacterial or fungal. Scabs form with infection underneath them.  Regardless of the cause, treatment involves clipping the hair off the legs and then removing the scabs.  This can be painful, and in many cases requires your veterinarian to sedate the horse, then use a chlorhexidine shampoo to soak off the scabs and gently remove them.  In recurring cases, your vet may need to culture the area to determine the bacterial organism and which antibiotic to use, as well as doing a microscopic exam of the tissue and testing for fungus.  After the scabs have been removed, treating with an antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory cream is usually effective. Some cases will also require fly ointment to control flies, and those with deeper infections and swelling of the legs may require oral antibiotics plus temporarily wrapping the legs.

Category: Skin Tumors in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The skin is the most common site for tumors in horses and today we are going to talk about some skin tumors and their treatments. The most common skin tumor is called a sarcoid and there are several different types of it. Sarcoids are non-malignant but can invade local tissue and cause a lot of damage. Sarcoids can appear flat, warty, or nodular and usually affect the head, neck, ventral body, and the legs. Also, sarcoids can develop at wound areas, even surgical wounds. It is important for your vet to biopsy any skin tumor because many tumors can look similar but require different treatments. Sarcoids can be removed surgically but it has been shown that 15-82% of these tumors will recur so surgical removal should be performed cautiously. Some of these sarcoids have tissue that extends far around the tumor and so it is sometimes difficult to remove the entire tumor even though it may appear it was all removed. If the entire tumor is not removed, it can certainly recur and for this reason, it is always a good idea to inject a drug around the incision after removal to prevent regrowth. Most of the drugs that are injected into these tumors are cancer drugs so it is important to be careful with these drugs and for this reason, your vet will always inject these drugs and not dispense them. A common drug used for this is Fluorouracil (5-FU) as it is inexpensive and seems to be effective. There are many other treatments for sarcoids including cryotherapy, which is freezing the tumor. Numerous creams are available to apply to these tumors and even Crest toothpaste has been applied to sarcoids in horses with some success. Join us next time for more on equine skin tumors.

Category: Staph Pyoderma and Pruritus in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English This time of year in Texas we see a lot of horses that are itchy and lose hair after they have rubbed on various objects. There are many different skin diseases that cause itching in horses and today I am going to start a series about these conditions. One of the most common causes of itchy skin is a bacterial infection of the skin. According to the equine dermatologists at U.C. Davis, the most common bacterial infections are staph infections. These infections usually form crusts, and many times are arranged in a circular fashion so that many people mistake these lesions for ringworm.  They also can appear as small scabs that are raised slightly above the skin and commonly occur in many areas on the horse including the sides, neck, inner thighs, and especially down on the pasterns just above the hoof. Many times these staph infections are secondary to some type of irritation including insect bites, weeds, or constant moisture. However, many times no cause can be found. Regardless, staph infections could be transmitted to people if it is one of the resistant staph infections. For this reason, it is important to wear gloves when treating these lesions. Your vet should be called to culture the infections to determine the best antibiotic to use. Initially, most horses are treated with an oral trimeta sulfa antibacterial until the culture result is received from the lab. Removal of the scabs is also helpful but painful, and it is easier to soak the scabs with an antibacterial shampoo to soften the scabs before removal. Join us on our next program for information on other skin diseases that cause itching and hair loss in the horse.

Category: Subcutaneous Emphysema in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have a horse that develops air under the skin and thus looks like someone has inserted an air hose there, know that there are several conditions that can lead to this appearance.  The most common cause of subcutaneousemphysema, or air under the horse’s skin, is a laceration in the axillary area between one of the forelimbs and the chest.  A deep laceration in this area can dissect upwards deeply between the chest wall and the front leg and allow air to enter the tissue, usually 3-4 days after the injury.  Although air can enter the tissue, the tissue acts as a one-way valve and prevents the air from escaping, so as the horse moves more air enters the wound area and air begins to build up under the skin. These horses can look really strange. Although most of the time the air will eventually be resorbed (sucked back in) on its own, sometimes it can lead to a serious problem.  The air can enter the structures inside the chest cavity and can even be deadly by leading to pneumothorax, a condition that prevents the horse’s lungs from expanding.  It is also possible the air can carry bacteria and spread the infection over the entire body under the skin. Although it seems you could just stick a needle in the horse’s skin and remove the air, it doesn’t work that way as the air is actually in the tissue and cannot be removed with a needle.  Treatment involves decreasing the horse’s activity level to prevent further air accumulation and to temporarily seal the incision by packing it with sterile material that can be changed every other day. Most of these horses also need to be on antibiotics for infection control. Trauma to the respiratory system or to the esophagus can also lead to air trapped under the skin but is much less likely than a laceration under the front legs.  The air will eventually resorb in most cases but may require 3 about weeks to do so.

Category: Treating Scratches in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Scratches, a condition that affects the horse’s lower legs, can be difficult to treat and prevent. Correctly called equine pastern dermatitis and although not a specific disease, it is a reaction pattern on the horse’s lower legs. Dr. Anthony Yu, DVM, MS, Dipl. ACVD, says in the publicationThe Horsethat finding the underlying factor is the key to treating and preventing the condition. Scratches can affect any breed. You’ve likely seen horses with scabs along the pastern and even up to the hock. These scabs are stuck very tightly to the skin and are painful to remove, and your horse is painful when you examine these areas. In draft horses with feathers, mites are commonly found and this can increase the chances of scratches occurring. However, anything that can irritate the leg can cause the syndrome, such as an allergy to weeds in the pasture, mosquitoes or other flying insects, and even standing in mud. As the mud dries, it sticks to the skin and causes irritation. The skin becomes infected and gets thicker as time goes on with redness, scaling, and crusting. Chemicals or other medications used to treat the problem can also irritate the skin and make the condition worse. Sometimes a biopsy of the area is required to make the diagnosis of the underlying cause as an immune-medicated disease can be involved. Treatment involves having your veterinarian sedate your horse because the affected area is painful, clipping all the hair off of the affected area, and shampooing the area with an anti-infective shampoo. Rinse the area and then wrap lightly for several days in a row with an anti-infective ointment containing cortisone to reduce inflammation and pain. Many of these horses will also need oral antibiotics to fight the infection.

Category: Using Platelet Rich Fibrin to Help Healing Equine Wounds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Lacerations commonly occur in horses and some of them can be difficult to heal.  Equine wounds, especially on the lower legs, are very susceptible to proud flesh. That prevents the wounds from healing and if not treated correctly, large amounts of scar tissue can develop.  These wounds can be painful with chronic infections and can be a source of lameness. Many of these wounds on the lower legs cannot be sutured, or the sutures will not hold, and this leaves an open wound with a large amount of area for the skin to cover.  Some of these can take months to heal with daily wrapping and surgery to remove proud flesh. Platelet rich plasma has been used to aid in wound healing as it contains growth factors to encourage healing with little scar formation.  However, platelet rich plasma is a liquid, which makes it difficult to keep in contact with the wound surface.  To solve this issue, Dr. Corey Orava developed a product called platelet rich fibrin. It is a solid material.  The platelet fibrin is formed using the horse’s own red blood cells. The cells are removed, leaving a fibrin clot that is a solid piece of material. It can be flattened and applied to the wound, and even sutured to the wound surface.  There is no risk of rejection as the product is formed from the horse’s own blood and in many cases will incorporate into the wound and will be fully resorbed.  Platelets are naturally activated by exposure to damaged tissue and they release granular contents into a wound environment, which includes anabolic growth factors that are responsible for initiation, propagation, and maintenance in all phases of wound healing. Platelet rich fibrin may be helpful for healing equine lower leg wounds, so talk to your equine veterinarian about it.

Category: Vitiligo in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Some horses can develop a lack of skin pigmentation, usually around their eyes, called vitiligo. If you have seen horses with a lack of pigment in some regions of the skin and there is no inflammation, vitiligo is possible. Fortunately, the condition is cosmetic only and has no detrimental effects on the horse. Equine nutritionist Dr. Clair Thunes, Ph.D., states in the publicationThe Horsethat the syndrome is thought to be an immune-mediated condition and occurs in other mammals, including humans, dogs, and pigs. An animal’s immune system attacks and kills melanocytes, which are the cells that produce the pigment in the animal’s skin. When these cells are destroyed, the skin becomes white or unpigmented. The disease was mentioned 3500 years ago in humans, but the first known report in horses was in 1931. That does not mean the condition did not exist before, but there were no scientific reports. The disease can occur in several breeds and is particularly common in Arabians. It is referred to as Arabian fading syndrome or pinky syndrome. Arabian mares sometimes develop the condition around their eyes when pregnant, but it is unknown why this happens. It is thought that vitiligo can be stress-related, as it comes and goes, and could be why it occurs in pregnant mares. Doctors have tried numerous treatments on people with varying results. Nutritional changes may help in some horses. In a study, one horse with this condition was supplemented with vitamins A, D, E, and B12, while another horse was fed excessive copper supplements. Both horses had their conditions resolved, but treatments are difficult to evaluate scientifically in a disease where the symptoms come and go, so it is hard to prove that vitamins and copper played a role in the resolution of vitiligo in these two horses. If you think your horse may have vitiligo, consult with your veterinarian to rule out any other skin condition.

Category: Wound Care Products for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses are easily injured so treatment of equine wounds is fairly common. There are many products available that can be applied topically on equine wounds, and some are good and some are not so good. To tell the difference, you can’t go to Dr. Google because you can’t determine the truth from the people trying to sell you something, regardless of their glowing testimonials. The best plan is to ask your vet. Dr. Dean Hendrickson from Colorado State indicates the best and safest wound cleaner is saline as it does not damage the tissue. You can get sterile saline that is used as a contact lens solution or you can get large bags of sterile saline from your veterinarian. You can also use regular tap water but it is not the same concentration as saline so although it can be used, it is not ideal. Lots of folks use betadine in wounds but full-strength betadine can kill tissue, impair healing, and contribute to infection instead of preventing it. If you are going to use betadine, we usually mix it in saline and make it about the color of weak iced tea. However, there is no evidence to suggest that it is any more effective than using saline alone. Chlorhexidine had also been used on wounds and just like betadine, can lead to damage of the tissue and infections if mixed too concentrated. Hydrogen peroxide can be used but it is not very beneficial or effective in preventing infection. Silver sulfadiazine can be used on wounds and is effective at killing bacteria and yeast. Another topical antibiotic is the yellow Furacin ointment and although it was used commonly in the past, it is not very effective as an antibacterial and can even delay wound healing. Triple antibiotic ointment can be used and is safe and effective for most equine wounds.

Category: Wounds between the Horse's Foreleg and Chest
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The area between a horse's foreleg and chest, where the front leg is attached to the chest, is called the axillary area. It is a common area in which horses get injured and lacerated. A wound there can lead to an unusual condition.  Axillary wounds tend to be quite deep and can extend eight to 12 inches upward from the surface of the cut as a wound in this area allows the tissue to separate easily.  Because the wound in most cases is really deep, the cut tissue acts as a one way valve for outside air; it allows air to enter the wound but not exit.  This can lead to an accumulation of air under the all of the horse's skin, not just the area of injury.  It can look like you stuck a needle under the horse's skin and turned on an air compressor.  Fortunately, in most cases the air will be resorbed after a period of time and so it's not dangerous to the horse. However, in some cases, the air can enter the chest and lead to a pneumothorax, a serious and potentially fatal condition in which abnormal air surrounds the lungs and causes rapid and shallow breathing. If this occurs, a large needle must be placed into the horse's chest to remove the air. To prevent air from entering into the wound after it has been explored and cleaned, the wound should be packed with sterile gauze or sterile sponges. The wound can then be sutured except for a small area to remove and replace the gauze.  It is likely the sutures will not hold but the time the sutures do hold allows the wound to start closing and decreases contamination of bacteria and air into the wound.  Wounds that cannot be sutured should have a bandage sutured over the wound to prevent air and bacterial contamination. If your horse develops a wound under the foreleg, call your veterinarian as these wounds can be deadly.

Category: A Healthy Intestinal Tract May Improve Your Horse’s Response to Vaccines
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses can respond to vaccines differently, and itis believed that the response to vaccines can be related to the health of your horse’s intestinal tract.Most vaccines require boosters because an animal’s immunity decreases over time, and a booster stimulates immunity. There are conditions that decrease the horse’s response to vaccines. Any disease process can do this, especially equine metabolic syndrome, or EMS, an insulin-resistant condition. Horses commonly have equine metabolic syndrome, and those horses are usually overweight and have a different number and type of normal organisms in the gastrointestinal tract. The number and type of organisms in the GI tract are called themicrobiota, and disruption of these organisms can affect the immune system. Dr. Kathleen Crandall, Equine Nutritionist, Kentucky Equine Research, says in the publicationThe Horsethat 70% of a horse’s immune system is located in the intestinal tract, where both beneficial and non-beneficial bacteria reside in the intestinal lumen and usually stay in balance. If an imbalance occurs, the immune response can trigger inflammation. Dr. Amanda Adams, Ph.D., Assistant Professor at the University of Kentucky Gluck Equine Research Center, says that one study showed feeding prebiotics changes the immune response to influenza vaccination in horses. However, it is not known if these horses were better protected against the disease. There is limited research to clearly identify which supplements may optimize themicroflorato support a horse’s immune system best. Although there seem to be hundreds of supplements available claiming to support the immune system, there is very little research to indicate that these supplements work. Ask your veterinarian about immune system supplements you may be considering for your horse.

Category: AAFCO Pet Food Labeling
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pet food marketing can get confusing. The labeling does not provide detailed nutritional information and it’s easily misunderstood by consumers. Try as you might, sometimes reading the label doesn’t give you enough answers. However, the more you know about what pet food labels indicate – and don’t – the better off your pet will be. What is AAFCO? AAFCOis the go-to organization for understanding animal feed, including food for pets. It does not regulate or inspect anything, nor is it a government agency. It is a group whose members are government agencies representing the 50 states, Canada, and the federal government. It is not a regulatory body and has no ability to monitor or enforce specific food manufacturing procedures. Animal feed specialists indicate to them what is appropriate for a specific species, and AAFCO provides model feed laws. AAFCO does not approve or certify any pet food, treat, or supplement products. The FDA, not AAFCO, regulates pet food, and FDA is a member of AAFCO. State feed control officials can choose to adopt these model feed laws – if they do, then monitoring and enforcement duties are the responsibility of the individual state. Pet food manufacturers that sell food must comply with all relevant federal or state laws. Most pet foods sold in multiple states will comply with the AAFCO guidelines. AAFCO relies on current scientific knowledge to provide guidelines for pet food composition which, if followed,minimize the risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, the FDA enforces food safety through the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, which demands that pet foods, like human foods, be “pure and wholesome, safe to eat, produced under sanitary conditions, contain no harmful substances, and be truthfully labeled.” Therefore, pet food manufacturers are legally responsible for providing nutritionally adequate, safe, and wholesome products that conform to local, state, and federal law. AAFCO requires nine components to be printed on a pet food label:  What are the different AAFCO nutritional adequacy designations for pet foods? There are four possible AAFCO nutritional adequacy statements that can appear on pet food labels. These must be printed verbatim as one of the following: How are AAFCO feeding trials conducted? The guidelines for an AAFCO feeding trial vary depending on the diet type being evaluated. There are four protocols: maintenance, growth, gestation/lactation, and all life stages. Although the minimum standards for each type of trial must be met, companies may add on other components to a feeding trial, such as plasma amino acid measurement, digestibility studies, full blood chemistry panels, and complete blood counts to gain additional information about the suitability of their diets for the life stage being tested. Foods can be put through AAFCO feeding trials even if they do not qualify for a “formulated to meet AAFCO” feeding statement due to deficient or excessive levels of nutrients. One example is veterinary therapeutic diets formulated for chronic kidney disease, which are intentionally formulated to contain phosphorus (+/- protein) at concentrations below the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles for adult maintenance; many of these have passed maintenance feeding trials and thus have a “feeding trial” nutritional adequacy statement on the bag. If they have not undergone feeding trials, they must carry the statement: “This product is intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.” Such diets are not allowed to reference the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles on the label. Theoretically, the flip side is that diets that fail feeding trials but contain nutrient levels within the specified minimum and maximum concentrations per AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles can be marketed with a “formulated to meet” adequacy statement. Ideally, diets are formulated to comply with the concentrations specified by the AAFCO Food Nutrient Profiles and then pass appropriate feeding trials. Foradult maintenance canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Forgrowth canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Forreproduction canine and feline diets, the feeding trial guidelines are: Do AAFCO feeding trials accomplish what they claim to accomplish? Many pet owners and clinicians have raised the concern that AAFCO feeding trials do not represent what really happens in a pet’s life, i.e., that feeding a diet for six months is not the same as feeding a diet for 10 years. That is true. However, although AAFCO trials are imperfect, they do identify most serious acute and semi-acute nutritional deficiencies or excesses, and some minor ones. Furthermore, manufacturers are free to supplement the minimum protocol requirements with additional measures of nutritional adequacy. Also, consider that diets for growth, gestation/lactation, or all life stages get tested more rigorously compared to maintenance since the nutritional demands of those animals are greater. Evaluation of diets under AAFCO guidelines also includes an examination of the nutrient content of the diet being tested. The nutrient content can be determined either by testing a sample of the finished diet or by using the nutrient content of the individual ingredients in the food to calculate the diet composition. The latter is less desirable, since ingredients are naturally variable in nutrient content and because processing and nutrient interactions could alter bioavailability (how much can actually be absorbed and used by your pet's body) in the final diet. There is no requirement for either in vivo or laboratory testing of pet food products if the formulation method of substantiating nutritional adequacy is used. Some companies have performed other in vivo testing (in-vivo meaning taking place within a living thing) and even lifelong feeding trials to demonstrate that their diets provide complete and balanced nutrition for the expected feeding duration (i.e., “for life”). How can you identify the pet foods that have undergone “more rigorous” testing of their pet food, rather than just the AAFCO statement on the bag? Unfortunately, you can't. Even veterinarians can’t. The pet food label is really a legal document and is not designed to convey significant nutritional information. As much as some sources (such as internet ranking lists) would like it to be possible, you cannot evaluate 'quality' from the label, especially from ingredient lists. You need to consider the manufacturer (reputation, experience, investment in AAFCO trials and research, etc.), cost, availability, and how your pets are doing on various diets. Board-certified veterinary nutritionists in clinical practice are alerted to dietary issues with specific diets because of extensive interaction with clients, practitioners, and each other. Therefore, these specialists are often a reliable resource for determining which diets are causing disease problems. In addition, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Nutrition Toolkit developed by the WSAVA Global Nutrition Committee provides many useful nutrition resources includingRecommendations on Selecting Pet Foods. This document lists eight questions to help owners assess pet foods: Factors to consider about a brand: Things to look for on a pet food label: It is ideal for a manufacturer to have a qualified nutritionist as a full-time employee rather than just as a consultant. Dr. Cailin Heinze, a board-certified nutritionist, additionally prefers companies that perform testing above and beyond AAFCO trials, especially with veterinary therapeutic diets. Furthermore, Dr. Heinze looks for company longevity as a sign of a successful track record and is critical of “guerrilla marketing” in pet supply stores (aggressive, emotion-based strategies directly to consumers). Finally, she looks for companies willing to share full nutritional profiles (e.g. full or typical analysis) of their diets rather than just a guaranteed analysis, and provide updated information with regular batch testing. Understanding what’s best for your pet isn’t always easy. Oftentimes the only way to get a clear answer to your question is to telephone (not email) the manufacturer. However, the best chance for your pet’s good health is to begin with food bearing an AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement on its label.

Category: Adding Fat to your Horse's Diet for Weight Gain
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Some horses need to gain weight but cannot eat large amounts of carbohydrates for various reasons. High levels of carbohydrates in a horse’s ration are a concern for horses prone to stomach ulceration, those with a history of colic, those with equine metabolic syndrome, and those susceptible to laminitis and founder. To provide energy for these horses by feeding something other than carbohydrates, feeding fat is a good option and there are several sources of fat for horses. One source is to feed a high fat concentrate and many of these feeds contain up to 12 percent fat. The fat is supplied by vegetable oil or rice bran. However, Catherine Whitehouse with Kentucky Equine Research indicates some manufacturers use dried distillers grains, flaxseed, and full fat soybeans. Another fat source that can be used is straight vegetable oil as vegetable oil is 100% fat. As far as the type of oil, some believe the omega 6 fatty acids in corn oil are less desirable than soybean oil that contains more omega 3 fatty acids. Cereal grains such as oats and corn also have high concentrations of omega 6 fatty acids, so this further increases the amount of omega 6 fatty acids, so feeding an oil other than corn oil may be advisable. You can start these horses on 2 ounces of oil twice a day, gradually building up to 8 ounces twice a day, and most horses will eat this oil placed directly on top of their food. Another source of fat is stabilized rice bran, which is about 20% fat and is palatable to horses. Many folks prefer rice bran because it is less messy to feed than the oil and can easily be mixed in with a regular feed. Consult with your veterinarian about the best source of fat for your horse.

Category: Barometric Pressure and Colic
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses seem to colic when the weather changes. Veterinarians and horse owners have believed for decades that a weather change increases the chance of colic. No one knows the exact cause of this increasing number of colic cases, but as the weather quickly changes, the number of colic cases increases in the spring and fall. One possibility is that horses seem to drink less water with the weather change, and drying of the ingesta can lead to an impaction. A student at the University of Pennsylvania did a thesis paper on the relationship between barometric pressure changes and the incidence of colic.  The study concluded that the best predictors of colic are age, the horse’s geographical latitude, the incidence of previous colic events, and barometric pressure drop within 12 hours of the event. For each additional year of age, the odds of colic increase slightly. However, for every barometric pressure decrease in inches of mercury of atmospheric pressure, the odds of colic increase two and ½ times.  In the northern hemisphere, the study also found that the farther north a horse lives, the more variable the climate and the more stress the animal experiences adapting to the environment, with the chance of colic increasing by two for every degree of latitude moving north. With the bad weather, managerial changes occur that may alter feeding schedules, turnout and exercise, and other types of changes in routine that cause stress. So, when a low-pressure frontal system passes through your area, closely monitor for colic over the following 12 hours.

Category: Best Grazing Time for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In general, keeping your horse in the pasture is much better than in a stall. Horses that are turned out have a lower incidence of colic, anxiety, fear, and less behavioral abnormalities. However, all horses cannot be out on pasture all the time and some cannot be on pasture at all. Horses with insulin resistance or those that are overweight should not be on pasture at all without a grazing muzzle because most pastures contain large amounts of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) and fructan is a major part of the NSCs. Kentucky Equine Research indicates that ingesting fructans is the main reason horses develop laminitis and founder on grass; it happens because the fructans are not broken down in the upper GI tract but pass to the lower GI tract and ferment, which leads to the problem. The amount of fructan in the grass varies with the type of grass, time of day, season, and the part of the plant ingested. It is important to know that fructans are high in periods of rapid growth of grass that usually occurs in the early spring. Fructan levels are also higher in the stems than in the leaves, so avoid overgrazing to prevent horses eating close to the ground. In the fall as the grass starts to turn brown, many folks feel it is okay to turn these insulin-resistant horses out because the grass appears dead. However, stressed grass due to drought can also contain high levels of fructans so you still cannot turn these horses out without a grazing muzzle. Also, fructans are produced in the leaves due to the photosynthesis that occurs in the daytime, so grazing in the early morning will limit amount of fructans consumed.

Category: Blister Beetles in Horse's Alfalfa Cause Severe GI Irritation, Colic and Death
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you feed alfalfa to your horses, you need to know about blister beetles. Blister beetles that are sometimes found in alfalfa hay can cause a serious problem in horses. They contain a chemical called cantharidin, which is extremely toxic to horses. The Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab indicates only about four grams of dried beetles are required to be fatal in a horse. Although there are 200 species of these beetles in the United States, the striped blister beetle in the southwestern part of the country causes the most problems as they feed on alfalfa blooms. In Texas, horse owners often do not feed Texas-grown alfalfa to their horses but get their alfalfa from areas where this beetle is not as commonly found. Horses with cantharidin toxicosis develop colic, decreased appetite, depression, sweating, blood in the urine, dark mucous membranes, increased heart and respiratory rates, and low blood calcium. Many horses will also develop oral ulcerations and will salivate excessively due to erosions in the mouth. Treatment is not very successful as many of these horses will not survive. Treating pain is important, and most horses are severely dehydrated, so intravenous fluids are required. Giving the horse mineral oil in the stomach can sometimes tie up the toxin, as can giving activated charcoal. These horses have severe ulcerations in their stomach and small intestines, so usingomeprazoleto decrease acid andsucralfateto coat the stomach is helpful. Depending on the amount of toxin ingested, horses require early and aggressive treatment to survive. Horses that do not survive can have their stomach contents or fecal contents tested for the toxin, and a lab can identify beetles in hay.

Category: Chronic Diarrhea in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Chronic diarrhea is not uncommon in horses and can be a real difficult problem to diagnose and treat.  Most of the horses are healthy otherwise but seem to have continual or intermittent diarrhea that does not respond to changes in feed or deworming medications.  Dr. Ashley Whitehead from the University of Calgary indicates at the AAEP convention that basic diagnostic bloodwork is required as well as fecal egg counts to check for parasites.  There is also an equine diarrhea panel that can identify disease-producing organisms in the horse’s intestine.  However, some of these organisms are normally found in the horse’s intestine so this test may not be helpful unless the bacteriaSalmonellais found. Unfortunately, 30% of the cases remain undiagnosed as it is difficult to determine the cause in many cases.  Other causes include sand accumulation in the intestine, which your vet can test for.  Also, inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal lymphoma can cause intermittent diarrhea but can only be diagnosed by an intestinal biopsy, which is not an easy process in a horse.  A sample can be taken from the rectum and analyzed and that can aid in the diagnosis if the condition is in the rectum.  Malabsorption can lead to diarrhea in horses and there are tests for glucose that can be used to diagnose that.  And some horses have a condition called intestinal dysbiosis in which the bacteria in the intestine is abnormal and giving a horse intestinal contents from a healthy horse through a nasogastric tube may be helpful.  Although pre- and probiotics are commonly used in these cases, this treatment is not effective in many horses.  Sometimes trial and error with different feeds and different medications are required to treat these chronic diarrhea cases.

Category: Colic in Horses is Not a Disease
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. David Ramey from Los Angeles wants to remind all horse owners that colic is not a disease but only a clinical sign of a disease.  Just like babies’ colic and people with tummy aches, these are not diseases but clinical signs. Colic simply means the horse is experiencing abdominal pain but it may not even be related to the GI tract although it’s commonly of GI origin.  He also indicates that methods to prevent all colics are unlikely to be effective, such as changing feeding programs, changing exercise programs or a adding a supplement. However, there are some things you can do to keep your horse’s digestive tract as healthy as possible, and the main thing is to make sure the horse has plenty of clean, fresh water.  Horses drink up to 10 gallons of water a day or more in a hot climate. Horses prefer buckets to automatic waterers because when they drink, they usually want to drink a lot, which is difficult with an automatic waterer.  And they generally like warm water versus cold water.  Next allow your horses to exercise as much as possible as it has been shown that horses in pasture colic less than those kept in stalls.  If your horse is boarded in sandy soil areas, it is important to feed your horses in a trough off the ground to decrease sand intake as sand can cause irritation to the digestive tract and even blockage, leading to colic.  Make sure that the majority of your horse’s diet is high quality forage, either grass in the pasture or hay.  Also, feed as little grain as possible because grain and concentrates increase the risk of intestinal problems.  Another important fact is that 90% of colic cases occur within 3 days of a food change, so always gradually change feed and even hay over a 10-day period and always feed horses on a regular schedule.

Category: Colic Surgery for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Colic is likely the most common health condition seen in horses. But should you treat your horse at home, or will your veterinarian recommend surgery? About 90% of colic cases resolve with no treatment or with medical care only, and about 10% require surgery. The problem is, it’s hard to know at the initial exam if the case of colic your horse seems to be going through is mild or will need surgery. Some horses can be very painful and respond to medical treatment while others just seem depressed but may have a surgical lesion (damage to tissue caused by colic or other condition). This is the reason for contacting your veterinarian at the early signs of colic. If you have already given your horse multiple pain killers prior to your veterinarian’s arrival, you may be delaying surgery that could result in more intestinal damage and decrease the chance of survival. For example, if you give your horse a pain killer to control pain and the horse needs surgery, the horse may respond short-term and make you think everything is fine, giving more time for the intestine to be damaged prior to surgery. Most veterinarians will refer surgical cases to a referral center that performs colic surgery. In many cases, the surgical center may be hours away, so a long trailer ride is required. For this reason, your veterinarian must try to predict if your horse may need surgery early on. If your veterinarian waits until they are sure a horse needs surgery, some horses may not survive the trip. The most important sign that indicates surgery may be required is uncontrollable pain. If pain medication is only effective for a short period, surgery will likely be required. If your veterinarian continues to drain large volumes of fluid off the horse’s stomach, surgical referral should be considered. Another reason for referral is an increased heart rate even with pain medication or finding a twist in the intestine during the physical exam.

Category: Colic Update in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today I am talking about signs you may see if your horse is exhibiting colic. Colic simply means abdominal pain not necessarily related to the gastrointestinal tract. However, colic in horses is usually related to the GI tract and some horses show pain differently than others, while just like humans some horses have a higher pain threshold than others. Many horses with colic appear restless and may show more or less movement in the stall than normal. Some horses will walk circles in the stall and not stopping, while others lie down. Some will roll also, although it's important to try to keep the horse from rolling if possible. With an enlarged gas-distended intestine, rolling can lead to twisting of the intestine, which makes the condition much more serious, although the intestine can twist even if the horse does not roll. Many horses will also sweat due to the pain involved. One sign I see commonly is that the horse will not eat. I don't believe I have ever seen a horse with a significant colic eat, and I use this as one sign of recovery because if the horse does not eat after treatment, I feel they are still having some pain. Other signs of pain include pawing, kicking at the belly, and staring at their flanks, while some horses will curl their upper lips. Some horses with colic have decreased bowel movements, but not all. The horse has a large amount of intestine and the upper portion of it could be distended and inactive and yet the lower portion could be functional and the horse could still be having bowel movements in the early stages. So although bowel movements are good to see in colic cases, this sign does not mean a lot as far as the horse's over all condition. Any colic can be serious, so do not wait if you see these signs but call your vet immediately.

Category: Colic: Waiting for the Veterinarian
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What can horse owners do while your horse is colicking and still waiting for the vet to arrive?  This is certainly a stressful time and the main thing to remember is not to panic.  There is really nothing medically you can do that will make a lot of difference in the outcome, but remaining calm may help your horse stay calmer also.  You have probably heard lots of things to do, including walking your horse and putting him in a trailer to encourage a bowel movement.  Dr. Diana Hasell is a board-certified emergency veterinarian and she indicates the best thing to do is attempt to keep your horse up and moving and prevent him from rolling.  If your horse seems more comfortable walking, then it is okay to do so until the veterinarian arrives.  Walking seems to stimulate gastrointestinal motility in some cases, but some horses may be so painful you cannot keep them up regardless of everything you do. A common question is should you give Banamine before the veterinarian arrives and the answer is no unless your veterinarian recommends you give the drug.  If the drug is given, it must be given in the vein and missing the vein can cause a severe infection.  Although it is labeled to give in the muscle, this should never be done as a severe muscle infection can develop.  The problem with giving Banamine before your vet arrives is two-fold.  First, it does not allow your vet to examine the horse’s condition before pain medication was given, and second, Banamine could mask a serious problem and delay possible referral for surgery.  It is probably a good idea to keep your horse from eating until your veterinarian arrives.  All cases of colic are potentially deadly so calling your vet immediately is the safest thing to do.

Category: Diarrhea in Newborn Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Diarrhea in newborn foals can develop as a result of inflammation in the GI tract, decreased motility, increased secretion of fluid in the tract, and other causes. Studies show there are several risk factors for diarrhea in newborn foals, and one of these is using shavings as stall bedding as well as using antibiotics in the foals. You can decrease the incidence of foal diarrhea by disinfecting your foaling stalls, washing the mare's udder and tail before foaling, and foaling on pasture instead of in a stall. Diarrhea can be due to an infection or may be non-infectious and the most common type of non-infectious diarrhea is foal heat diarrhea. Dr. Gary Magdesian indicates in the Clinician that foal heat diarrhea usually occurs from five to 21 days of age and usually resolves without any treatment. However, it is possible some of these foals can dehydrate and will require fluid therapy. It was previously thought that foals developed foal heat diarrhea when the mare came into heat and that a hormonal change in the mare's milk led to a foal's diarrhea. It was also believed by some that a parasite was the cause and to prevent this mares were dewormed immediately after foaling. However, it is now known that the diarrhea is not due to changes in the mare's milk or a parasite but to normal maturation of the foal's GI tract. The bacteria in the foal's GI tract changes and becomes similar to the adult's normal flora by four weeks of age and the diarrhea usually resolves. So foal heat diarrhea is a normal sign that occurs in almost all foals and is due to the foal's initial ingestion of feed, plus ingesting the dam's feces if the tail is not washed prior to birthing.

Category: Digestion in Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The foal’s first meal is colostrum or first milk, and this first milk contains antibodies that help the foal fight off infection during its early life. Colostrum can be absorbed for up to 24 hours but the absorption rate is not equal as absorption the first 6 hours is much greater than the absorption the last 12 hours. The foal’s digestive tract changes rapidly during the first 2 weeks of life. Although the foal may nibble on grass at an early age, until about 2 months of age, the majority of nutrition comes from milk because the digestive tract is only able to handle milk. After 2 months of age, research from Kentucky Equine indicates the foal’s hindgut begins a period of maturation that lasts until about 6 months of age. The hindgut is populated by bacteria that the foal has ingested when nursing on the mare’s udder and by eating manure of the other horses. These bacteria colonize the hindgut and are necessary for hindgut fermentation to occur, which allows the older foal to utilize forage for nutrients. Of course, foals can also pick up infectious bacteria during this time that can lead to digestive tract and respiratory tract disease. One of the most common syndromes noted in almost all foals is foal heat diarrhea. Although it occurs at about the time the mare comes into her first heat after foaling, the mare’s foal heat really has nothing to do with the condition. Foal heat diarrhea is now believed to be due to microbial changes in the hindgut when the foal is about 10 days of age.

Category: Digestion in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about digestion in horses as it is different than many other domestic animals. Humans, dogs and cats have a simple stomach while cattle have a large rumen in which they can ferment grass and hay. Horses have the best of both worlds in this regard as they have a simple stomach but also have a cecum that acts as a large fermentation vat similar to the rumen in cattle. The difference is that the rumen in cattle is located at the beginning of the digestive tract while the cecum in horses is toward the end of the tract. What all this means is that horses can eat grass or hay, but they were designed to eat native grass by grazing on thousands of acres. They were not designed to eat large grain meals and large amounts of hay twice a day in a 1-hour period as they are required to do in most situations today. Then they stand around with nothing to eat the other 22 hours of the day and we wonder why we have so many colics, stomach ulcers and founders today. The small intestine is the major organ of digestion in the horse and this is the areain whichproteins, fats and carbohydrates are digested. Horses were initially thought to have a limited ability to digest fat because they do not have a gall bladder but they are actually efficient at digesting fat because bile from the liver is secreted directly into the small intestine. Non-structural carbohydrates are digested throughout the horse’s GI tract unless the amount of these carbohydrates overwhelms the ability of the small intestine to digest the full amount. The amount that reaches the cecum is rapidly fermented and causes a decrease in pH of the cecum, leading to severe digestive problems and possibly laminitis and founder.

Category: Digestion of Forage by Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An herbivore is an animal that eats plants. Most livestock that eat plants have a large vat called a rumen that ferments the vegetation before it enters the rest of the digestive tract. However, horses are unique in that they eat plants but do not have a rumen like cows - horses have a simple stomach. Horses are able to digest plants because they have a cecum, which is also a fermentation vat. The difference is that in horses the cecum is close to the end of the digestive tract, unlike animals with a rumen where the cecum is at beginning of the digestive tract. Because of this design, Dr. Karen Davidson with Purina Feeds indicates horses evolved as continuous grazers that grazed small, immature, easily-digested plants and were allowed unlimited free range grazing. Unfortunately, this scenario is not possible for most of today’s horse owners as most horses are kept in small areas and fed twice daily. The reason we see so many colic and founder cases is because horses are being fed in a manner that their body was not designed to support. And although there is not a lot we can do about this, as we certainly can’t turn all the horses out on the open range, it is important to realize the ideal management for horses and try to mimic this as closely as possible. For instance, you can see why it is important to keep horses out of stalls. Also, it is important to give them small amounts of feed as often as possible instead of feeding large amounts of hay and feed once daily. Although frequent feeding may be more difficult for you and take more time, you can see why it is more natural for the horse and may prevent colic. If you have questions about your horse’s nutrition, ask your equine veterinarian, who is your nutritional expert.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Gastrointestinal problems are a major area of disease in horses but unfortunately, examining all of their long intestinal tract can’t be done unless abdominal surgery is being performed as it is impossible to get a scope into the entire GI tract.  The stomach and a portion of the small intestine and colon can be examined with a scope, but that is the limit for a scope.  However, a new piece of technology has become available that will help examine the intestine better, and this is a tiny capsule with a camera inside.  The capsule is about one inch long and allows the veterinarian to visualize a large portion of the GI tract for ulcers or other abnormalities.  At the AAEP convention, a veterinarian at the University of Calgary said that the technology is wireless and transmits images from the inside of the GI tract to an external computer.  This technology has been used for several years in people and even in dogs, but is just now being used in horses. The camera is collected from the manure and can be used again.  Prior to the procedure, feed is withheld for 24 hours and water for 12 hours to make sure the GI tract is as clean as possible.  However, withdrawing feed for too long can cause a decrease in intestinal function, which can decrease the amount of the GI tract that can be visualized.  The capsule is given through a nasogastric tube placed in the horse’s stomach, and the horse is then fed a small amount to stimulate the gut to work and move the capsule with the camera through the intestine.  The battery lasts about 20 hours, so the amount of intestine examined depends on the rate of movement through the GI tract.  Although the camera cannot evaluate the cecum and large colon, the small intestine can be examined quite well. The procedure is safe. The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Feeds High in Starch Cause Inflammation in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A recent study out of Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas, showed high starch meals can lead to inflammation, and feeds high in starch are not recommended for some horses, increasing the level of interleukin 1b, a potent inflammatory maker. The publication The Horse said that this study found both overweight and older horses had higher levels of interleukin 1 b after consuming diets high in starch. The study involved two trials, and in the first trial, researchers divided middle-aged horses into two groups, those with normal weight and those that were overweight. The horses were fed the same diet including, hay and steam-rolled barley. On day 14, they checked blood samples and found overweight horses had an immediate increase in interleukin while the normal weight horses only had increases in interleukin after 14 days. Overweight horses were affected the quickest, but even normal horses had an increase in systemic inflammation following high starch diets. The second trial involved two groups of horses aged 12-14 years old and 20-23 years old. Both groups were fed steam-rolled barley, hay, and a concentrate. After 36 days, blood testing revealed older horses had higher levels of increased interleukin il-1b compared to the younger horses. These trials showed older and overweight horses had increased systemic inflammation compared to younger and fit horses. In humans, recent studies have shown that systemic inflammation like that caused by interleukin can cause neuroinflammation as is found with Alzheimer’s disease. Neuroinflammation is described as the brain's protective response to an inflammatory issue or challenge. Based on this study, feeding a high starch diet if your horse is overweight or is older is not recommended. Check with your veterinarian about your horse’s nutritional needs.

Category: Free Fecal Water Syndrome Isn't Diarrhea in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Free fecal water syndrome is not the same as diarrhea. With diarrhea, the entire stool is loose or even watery. With free fecal water syndrome, the stool is normal but small amounts of very thin water with a small amount of feces are passed before, after or during defecation. And although this does not seem like a major problem, some horses have enough of this free fecal water to pollute the tail and legs, and it can be severe enough to cause skin lesions. This material on the legs and tail also attracts flies and makes it very difficult to keep these horses clean. Although not a common problem, the condition occurs enough that it has been blamed on many different factors with no proof of any actual cause. Some possibilities for the problem include feeding alfalfa hay, feeding haylage or silage, drinking very cold water, poor dental care, and parasites. Also, various nutritional supplements are marketed to prevent this problem because it seems there is a nutritional supplement marketed to cure every horse problem whether there is any proof the supplement is effective or not. To try and learn more about the condition, a study was performed in Germany and it found that the condition more likely occurred in horses that had a low rank in a group of horses. Also, the condition was more common in horses in the winter as it was believed the subordinate horses were confined in a smaller space, which leads to more anxiety. Dental disease, parasites and cold water intake was shown to not be related to the condition. Geldings are more commonly affected than mares as mares are usually more dominant than geldings. Paint horses are also more commonly affected.

Category: Gastric Ulcers in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Stomach ulcers are a common problem in performance horses. It is important to know that the horse's stomach has two distinct areas, a squamous or non-glandular portion and a glandular portion. It is the non-glandular portion that most commonly has ulcers in performance horses. The reason this part becomes ulcerated is because there is no protection from stomach acid and exercise allows stomach acid to be splashed up onto the unprotected area and allows ulcers to develop. This is one of the reasons almost 100 percent of thoroughbred racehorses have some degree of ulcers after being in training for only 2 to 3 months. And 60 to 90 percent of standardbred racehorses, show horses, pleasure horses and endurance horses in training also have ulcers, so any horse that is in training is susceptible to some degree of ulceration. Stress also plays a role in the ulcers of the squamous portion of the stomach as ulcers have been shown to increase with certain trainers, urban location of stables, and a lack of contact with other horses. Ulcers in the glandular portion of the stomach is a completely different syndrome from ulcers in the non-glandular or squamous portion and the reason this is important is that lots of horses are treated with drugs like bute and Banamine, and folks are always concerned about using these drugs because they could cause ulcers. They can cause ulcers at higher than normal doses, but the ulceration is in a totally different area from ulcers caused by stress and training. So if your horse is prone to ulcers of the stomach's non-glandular portion due to training, it does not necessarily mean they are more likely to develop ulcers with bute or Banamine.

Category: Gastrointestinal Side Effects of NSAID Use in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pain medications are commonly used in horses, but some of them may be causing more gastrointestinal problems than previously thought. The most common pain medications used are classified as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, for short. Popular NSAIDs prescribed for horses include butazolidan (known commonly as bute), flunixin meglumine (known as Banamine®), and firocoxib (Equioxx®). Dr. Gaby van Galen, DVM, MSc, Ph.D., Dipl ECEIM, Dipl ECVECC, EBVS®, European Veterinary Specialist in Equine Internal Medicine, performed a study on 22 horses housed at her university’s hospital. These horses were not under observation for gastrointestinal issues. Some were treated with NSAIDs, and some were not. The horses were examined daily for signs of colic, depression, reduced appetite, and loose stool. Ultrasound exams, fecal occult blood testing, and serum chemistries were performed. The study found that 40% of theNSAID-treated horses had thickening of the inner lining of the intestinal tract in the upper right section of the colon after just three days of NSAID treatment. Dr. van Galen says this indicates there was a buildup of edema, or fluid, in the wall of the intestine, and some of these horses seemed uncomfortable and had decreased appetite, depression, and loose stools. These findings, along with blood testing and fecal occult blood testing, indicated these horses had mild colitis, while the untreated horses had none of these signs. The signs were mild, and it was not necessarily indicated to stop treatment, but it does show we need to be careful treating horses with bute and Banamine®, and we need to monitor them closely. Some horse owners may feel that giving NSAIDs regularly to their horses does not cause any problems, but this study shows these drugs may be causing more problems than first realized. Use of these type of drugs is not risk-free, and it is important to use as little bute and Banamine ®, or other NSAIDs, as possible. Consult with your veterinarian about NSAID use for your horse.

Category: Impaction Colic in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Impaction colic is one of the most common causes of colic. However, Dr. Sarah Freeman indicates at thehorse.com that many mild impactions may be missed by owners and even veterinarians. Impactions can cause severe pain and some require surgery while others are so mild that the horse does not even seem painful. In some of the mild cases, the horse may only lie down more than normal, eat less feed or pass a reduced amount of manure, so unless you are watching your horse closely, you may not know anything is wrong. Impactions of the small intestine are generally more painful and acute than those of the large colon so the location makes a difference in clinical signs. It is critical that impactions are treated early because many of them are related to dehydration, and an area of the intestine becomes dry and prevents movement of ingesta. The longer you wait, the dryer the area becomes and the harder the impaction becomes. Studies show that up to 50% of the mild and early impaction cases resolved with only minor treatment, while about 30% required additional treatment and only about 9% were severe. However, when you see your horse having a colic episode, you don't know which category your horse falls into, so you have to treat it. Failing to treat or delaying treatment increases the chance the horse will progress to a more serious stage of colic. This delay is especially important considering dehydration as the sooner that fluids are instituted in a horse that is not drinking, the greater the chance for survival and the less expensive it will be. So if your horse is not eating well or lying down more than normal, a mild colic may be involved and treatment is recommended.

Category: Initial Management of a Colicky Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If your horse has developed colic, what should you do?  The word colic strikes fear in the mind of most horse owners.  Dr. Rob Franklin with Full Bucket Animal Health in Weatherford indicates there is some debate on what you should do first.  Historically, horse owners have started walking their horse at the first signs of colic, and this is a good idea for low-grade colic cases.  It is recommended by most to walk the horse maybe 10 minutes every hour but not continually.  I have been called out to see colic cases that have been going on for hours and the horse has been walked the entire time.  The horses and owners are worn out and this is not necessary as the horse needs to rest some also.  Walking is helpful to prevent a mild colic from lying down but if your horse is in serious pain, then walking is not going to help. The second thing to do is call your vet.  I feel all colic cases are potential emergencies and should be seen by a vet.  It is a lot easier to get an initial exam and determine the severity rather than waiting until the horse is dehydrated and critical.  It is important to know if your horse has an appetite and if bowel movements are occurring.  However, lots of folks see a bowel movement and think the horse is okay and this may not be the case.  Horses have a long intestinal tract and so a bowel movement is possible with a functioning distal colon and rectum and yet the horse could still have a serious problem.  It is important to withhold food and grain initially and if the horse is hungry, allow them to graze for 5 minutes out of every hour. We don’t want to pack a lot more feed on top of an impaction, if there is one.  Offer water and monitor drinking as a 1,000-pound horse needs to drink about 6 gallons per day  minimum, and if this is not occurring, dehydration will develop.

Category: Myths About Equine Colic Surgery
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English You never want to hear your veterinarian say your horse needs colic surgery. Unfortunately, it does occur from time to time. Only about 10% of equine colic cases require surgery. Dr. Jacqueline Hill, DVM, Dipl. ACVS-LA, believes there are many myths about this type of surgery. If surgery is indicated, you will likely need to take your horse to a specialty center because this type of surgery requires a lot of equipment and staff to perform. Dr. Hill states that one myth about colic surgery is that some horses are too old. Although that may be a concern in a very old horse, for instance over 30 years of age, studies have shown that horses over 20 undergo colic surgery and recover as well as horses less than 15 years old. So if your horse is over 20 years old and in good health otherwise, successful colic surgery is possible. Another myth is horses are never the same after colic surgery. This is a difficult surgery and recovery can take up to three months of restricted exercise followed by another three months of gradually increasing exercise. However, one study recently reviewed records of over 200 colic surgeries of various breeds and disciplines. It found that 84% returned to their previous discipline and 79% did so at the same level or higher after surgery. Some horses may need part of their intestine resected (removed) during the surgery, and this is sometimes thought to decrease success. The outcome depends on the area of the intestine resected. The success rate of horses with resected intestines is from 65-75% depending on the area involved. The last myth addressed here is that once a horse has colic surgery, they will likely colic again. Study results reveal that if the horse does not already have a history of colic, it is unlikely to have increased colic rates after surgery.

Category: Older Horses Digestibility
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today I am going to talk about digestion of nutrients in older horses. In humans, nutritional requirements change with age, but there is not a lot of information about the changes in digestion as horses age. One older study indicated that geriatric horses have decreased digestion of phosphorus, fiber, and crude protein. It is possible these horses had parasites and may have also had dental disease, as this was not discussed in the study. Due to the lack of current information, a recent study was performed on 17 stock-type mares ranging in age from five to 28 years old. Each horse was dewormed, had no significant dental disease, and was fed three different diets consisting of hay only; hay plus a starch and sugar-rich concentrate; and hay plus a fat and fiber-rich concentrate. Each diet was fed for five weeks and feces and urine was evaluated to determine digestibility. Kentucky Equine research indicates that the study found older horses in good health can absorb nutrients as well as younger horses. There was no difference in digestibility of energy, neutral detergent fiber, crude protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus. So results of this study lead us to believe that there is no reason to change diets as a horse ages. This is assuming the horse has good dentition because if he has dental problems with missing and cupped out teeth, then a senior diet may be beneficial. The senior diets require less chewing so when your veterinarian is performing your horse's semi-annual exam, ask them to check your horse's teeth, check for parasites, and discuss the diet they recommend for your horse. You may not need to change diets just because your horse is getting older.

Category: Omeprazole Drugs for Stomach Ulcers in Horses: Some Don't Have Enough Omeprazole
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Stomach ulcers in horses are correctly called gastric ulcers. They are common in race horses and other performance horses. Only two products that treat and prevent these ulcers are approved the FDA; they are Ulcergard and Gastrogard. However, there are many other products marketed for treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers and the FDA is concerned about the safety and efficacy of these unapproved products. Because of this, the FDA recently issued nine warning letters to companies manufacturing drugs containing the active ingredientomeprazole. Testing by the FDA revealed that some of these unapproved products contained as little as 36% of the omeprazole claimed on the label to as much as 135% of the amount claimed. Because of these variances, the FDA wants horse owners to know they are concerned about the use of these unapproved products, including those containing omeprazole. Safety is one concern with these unapproved products as you really do not know how much of an ingredient is really in the product. Also, the efficacy of the unapproved product is questionable, especially with products containing omeprazole. Many studies have shown that most of the unapproved omeprazole products that are being used in horses are ineffective as they are destroyed by stomach acid before being absorbed. It is important to check with your veterinarian concerning the use of any product used in your horse; although FDA approved products may be more expensive, in this case you do really get what you pay for.

Category: Parasite Control in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It is possible that the deworming medication you are giving your horse may not be effective in killing parasites. At least that is the belief of Dr. Ray Kaplan at the University of Georgia. Dr. Kaplan indicates that the deworming programs many horse owners and farms use was developed back in the 60s. Studies back then revealed that deworming your horse every 8 weeks was the best method and this method worked really well during the 70s and 80s because new deworming drugs were invented that were very effective. However, now the parasites have changed and become much more resistant to the dewormers we have today. In fact, Dr. Kaplan indicates many horse owners are following recommendations from 30 to 40 years ago, many of the equine dewormers we are using today are totally ineffective and the ones that are effective are not keeping the number of parasites low for as long as they did in the past. In the 70s, the major parasite was the large strongyle that commonly caused colic. However, this parasite is well controlled at this point and the problem is the small strongyle. The problem with small strongyles is that very few dewormers are effective in killing the larval stages and the larvae cause the most problems. The larvae burrow into the wall of the intestine and then cause damage as they break out of the intestinal wall. Most dewormers kill only the adults and these larvae become adults after most of the damage has already been done. So the only method of decreasing intestine damage is to prevent pasture contamination by eggs so fewer larvae will develop. Join us next program when we will talk about methods to decrease pasture contamination.

Category: Plant Toxins and Liver Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Liver disease is not common in horses, but when it occurs it is usually due to toxins the horse has eaten. Signs of liver disease include decreased appetite, depression, colic, yawning, behavioral abnormalities, and yellowish coloration of the mucous membranes. Many plants contain a chemical called pyrrolizidine alkaloids, a class of plant toxins associated with disease in humans and animals. Horses ingesting these plants over a long period can develop liver disease. Some of the plants known to contain this chemical are Senecio and groundsel. Horses do not generally eat these plants unless there is nothing else to eat or it is baled in the hay. Cocklebur is another plant common in some western states, and at the 2-leaf stage, seedlings contain a large amount of a toxic chemical. The seedlings appear early in the spring before many other plants are growing, and are readily consumed by horses. It is important in the early spring to make sure horses have good quality hay and do not have access to cocklebur seedlings. Aflatoxin, another common toxin, is produced by molds on multiple different grains, especially when the plants have been stressed by drought or insects. The mold can grow on stored grain if stored in warm and damp conditions, and the toxin can be present without seeing mold on the grain. Always buy your horse’s feed from reputable sources, making sure that it is stored in a cool, dry location. If the grain has not been evaluated for aflatoxin, you can ask about having it sent off for testing. Blue-green algae is another toxin concern. Under certain conditions, these microscopic organisms undergo rapid growth called algal blooms on stock ponds and produce a toxin that affects the liver in horses. If your horse has access to a farm pond with the colored sheen of an algal bloom on the top, remove your horse from this pasture and use another source of water.

Category: Post-Colic Return to Performance Events in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Colic is a major cause of death in horses, and although most horses that colic do not require surgery, many do require it to survive. Whether or not to perform colic surgery is a difficult decision for many owners as the surgery is expensive and if the horse survives, the question is will the horse be useful for his intended purpose in the future. Two studies were performed to answer this question, and the respective authors reported that 81% and 90% return to expected performance after the surgery. However, Dr. Anthony Blikslager reports in The Practitioner that surgery at the referral center is not the total concern as far as costs. There is usually at least three months of recovery and then further rehab for another three months. A common problem that occurs after colic surgery includes a hernia that can develop at the incision line on the horse's belly. It is reported that 8-16% of horses will develop hernias, and horses with hernias have a three-fold risk of failing to return to their intended use at one year after the surgery. Also, up to 30% of horses develop diarrhea after colic surgery and many lose condition, which increases the time interval for them to return to their previous level of activity. Laminitis can also occur in horses after colic surgery although fortunately it is rare. The development of laminitis may be related to the cause of the colic as well as the aftercare received. Horses with colic surgery that also had lameness at the time of the colic were less likely to perform at the same level one year later. So when considering all these factors, the overall return to general use and performance following colic surgery is around 50%. This statistic is important to know when you have to make the decision about surgery on your horse.

Category: Preventing Enteroliths in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An unusual type of colic in horses is due to a large stone called an enterolith that forms in the intestine and can partially or completely block it. Colic is common in horses; Kentucky Equine Research indicates part of the reason it's common is that horses have over 100 feet of intestine coiled up in the abdomen in a fairly small space that doesn't allow much expansion. Any significant enlargement of the intestine is likely to be painful, which causes colic symptoms. Nutrition plays an important role in colic and it is especially involved in horses that develop enterolith stones in the intestine. Enteroliths are stones made up of chemicals in the intestine under certain circumstances and although the cause is not completely known, we know there are several factors that increase the risk of enteroliths forming in the intestine and one of those is feeding alfalfa hay. We don't see a lot of enteroliths in Texas and this may be because we don't feed as much alfalfa as other states. Other factors that contribute to the formation of enteroliths include the fact that certain breeds like Arabians are more prone to develop the condition. Plus, spending less than 50 percent of their time outdoors, and lack of pasture grazing, also increases the chance of developing enteroliths. Increased levels of magnesium, nitrogen and calcium as well as a high pH of the colon contribute to enterolith formation, and alfalfa contributes to all of these factors. The stones form around any object the horse may have ingested, including a small rock, nail, coin, metal fragment, cloth or piece of a rope. So if you have a horse that has a history of developing enteroliths, feeding grass hay may be a better option than alfalfa.

Category: Preventing Gastric Ulcers in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Stomach ulcers are common in humans but many of you may not realize they are also common in horses.  Most ulcers in horses are man made as they are  uncommon in wild horses and horses that graze on large amounts of acreage.  Scientific studies have indicated that 90% of racehorses are affected with stomach ulcers and this is not surprising considering their stress and training schedule.  However, even 60% of show horses are also affected, so all horses that are used in performance or showing are susceptible.  Ulcers are mostly man made and this is due to the fact that placing horses in stalls increases the chance of ulcers.  Also, feeding horses once or twice daily increases the chance of ulcers versus leaving the horses out on pasture to graze naturally.  Their stomachs produce acid 24 hours a day and if they don’t have food in the stomach by grazing continually, they are more likely to develop ulcers.  Stress is another cause of ulcers such as hauling to shows and training for events. A tip to help prevent stomach ulceration is to allow your horse free access to grass or hay at all times.  For horses that have to be stalled, be sure they are able to see other horses and have objects in the stall to keep them occupied such as a ball or other object.  There are many medications to decrease ulcers in horses but only a few have scientific proof of being effective.  A product called GastroGard is approved to treat and prevent ulcers in horses.  There are many other products advertised in horse magazines but most of these products have no scientific proof that they are effective.  Offering free access to feed and limiting stress are the most effective preventions.

Translating Return to English Diagnosis and treatment of colic in horses has certainly improved over the last 20 years but recurrent colic is still difficult to diagnose and treat. Dr. Amanda House indicates in the Practitioner magazine that colic is considered recurrent when three or more episodes occur over a period of a few months. The causes of recurrent colic are varied and this makes the problem that much more difficult to diagnose but intestinal parasites, gastric ulcers, sand accumulation, impactions, enteroliths, and inflammatory bowel disease are all possible causes. Certainly a good physical exam is required and your vet must also check all organ systems and not just the GI tract as colic can also be caused by reproductive problems and kidney or liver disease. Because of this, a rectal exam is required as well as blood work to check organ function. If a cause is not discovered, testing for parasites, collecting an abdominal fluid sample and using a long scope to examine the horse's stomach are good ideas. Also, ultrasound of the abdomen can help identify liver, kidney, and even intestinal problems. A piece of tissue or biopsy can be carefully removed from the rectal mucosa and submitted for testing, which can identify certain intestinal syndromes. Even after all of this, the reason some horses experience recurrent colic may be unknown. Sometimes preventing recurrent colic can be as simple as a change in diet, even if your horse has been on the current diet for a long time. However, this change must occur slowly over a period of weeks because a rapid change in diet can also lead to colic. If you have a horse that has recurrent colic, it is important to try and find the problem as eventually surgery may be required for one of the episodes.

Category: Research on Gastric Ulcers in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Gastric ulcers are commonly diagnosed in horses these days because we have a scope to actually look inside the horse’s stomach.  Dr. Al Merritt from the University of Florida says that 50-90% of horses suffer from gastric ulcers, and performance and racehorses are the most susceptible.  A horse has two stomach regions and therefore can have two different causes of ulcers in the non-glandular and the glandular portions.  The glandular portion is very acidic at a pH of 1-2 while the non-glandular portion has a neutral pH of 5-7.  Horses produce gastric acid whether they are eating or not and when eating, saliva is produced that increases the pH.  This increase is fine for horses grazing 24 hours a day but not for horses in stalls fed twice a day.  Common clinical signs are poor appetite, dullness, attitude changes, decreased performance, poor body condition, and colic pain. It has been shown that horses on a high concentrate ration and those kept in stalls are more susceptible to ulcers than those out grazing on pasture.  Those eating a diet with less hay and more grain are more likely to develop ulcers so feeding more hay and more turnout is a good idea.  Using slow feeders that require horses to eat smaller amounts frequently will decrease the chance of ulcers.  Although there are numerous supplements available over the counter to prevent and treat stomach ulcers, proof of effectiveness is not required to market them since the products are classified as a supplement rather than drugs.  The products Gastrogard and Ulcergard are the only products that are FDA approved and proven to treat and prevent gastric ulcers.  Before using a supplement to treat or prevent ulcers, Dr. Merritt recommends looking for scientific data and not testimonials from horse owners.

Category: Right Dorsal Colitis Caused by Phenylbutazone in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Phenylbutazone, or Bute, is the most common pain medication used in horses and is generally safe if used at the correct dosage. However, its most common side effect is a condition called right dorsal colitis, which is a potentially deadly inflammation of the right dorsal colon. Similar drugs such as Banamine can also cause right dorsal colitis, but Bute is more commonly reported, probably because it is used more commonly. The first signs noted with right dorsal colitis are colic and diarrhea although more severely affected horses will have depression, lethargy and a decreased appetite. Surprisingly, one study revealed horses less than 15 years old with an average of 6 years were the most affected, probably because younger horses are in competition and need Bute due to lameness. Ponies and foals are also more susceptible but overall, but it is unknown why some horses develop the disease and others do not at the same dosages. However, if the horse is off feed and dehydrated, is sick or has another type of gastrointestinal disease, Bute toxicity is more likely to occur. The toxicity causes damage to the colon wall that can lead to loss of blood and protein. Treatment includes fluid therapy and sometimes intravenous plasma to increase the protein level, plus giving medication to coat the intestine. Surgery can be performed by removing the affected area of the right dorsal colon but it is difficult. This is a serious disease as up to 40 percent of affected horses usually die, so if you are giving your horse Bute, watch for any abnormal symptoms and if noted, stop the bute and call your vet. Realize Bute and Banamine can cause serious and deadly side effects so check with your vet before using these drugs, especially in sick or dehydrated horses.

Category: Sand Elimination from the Horse's Gastrointestinal Tract
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are many causes of colic in horses, and sand colic is just one of them. Sand colic is one of the most common causes of horses who have recurrent colic, and it's common in many areas in which horses are kept on sandy soil. Many horses that are fed on the ground and are boarded on sandy soil or that graze on short grass on sandy pastures pick up small amounts of sand as they eat. Over time, this sand accumulates in the colon and causes inflammation, decreased function, and impaction. Several recommended products to remove the sand include psyllium and magnesium sulfate. Psyllium is the ingredient in the human product Metamucil, and magnesium sulfate is commonly known as Epsom salts; both of these products used to remove sand from horse's colon are commonly available over the counter. Of course, the dosage for a horse is much larger in than humans, as routinely a pound of each drug is administered to a horse by a nasogastric tube placed in the horse's stomach. There is some question as to which of these medications is most effective at removing sand and a study was performed in Helsinki, Finland, to determine the answer. A group of horses diagnosed with sand accumulation were divided into groups and one group was given psyllium, one group was given Epsom salts, and another group was given both. The group that received both psyllium and Epsom salts had the largest decrease in sand in the colon as found on x-rays. So it seems the use of psyllium and Epsom salts together is the most effective treatment for removing sand. However, the large amount of magnesium could cause a problem in horses who have renal disease.

Category: Stomach Ulcers in Donkeys
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many donkeys are used to protect sheep and goat herds from predators while others are kept as pets.  A donkey’s stomach is the same as a horse’s.  Stomach ulcers are a common problem in horses, especially performance horses. The stomach has two parts, the glandular and non-glandular portions.  In horses, the most common cause of ulcers on the non-glandular potion is exercise because as the horse moves the stomach acid splashes up on the unprotected portion.  However, since donkeys don’t usually do a lot of rigorous exercising, it is surprising that donkeys can also develop stomach ulcers in the non-glandular portion of their stomachs. An Italian study was conducted on 39 donkeys. All of these were non-athletes and non-working donkeys.  All underwent stomach exams with a gastroscope. None were on any medications. Results were that 51% of the donkeys had stomach ulcers and 95% of those were in the non-glandular portion.  It was really surprising that this many non-exercising, non-working donkeys had ulcers, and that the ulcers were in this area. For horses, other reasons for ulcers in this area include high-carbohydrate rations and being stalled and fed intermittently.  Most donkeys are not routinely stalled and are out on pasture grazing, which generally decreases the chance of ulcers.  Also, most donkeys are not fed - and should not be fed – high-carbohydrate rations so the reason for the stomach ulcers is unknown at this time.  However, it is important to know that over half of the donkeys in this study had stomach ulcers and this could be a reason for decreased appetite or colic in donkeys.

Category: Supplement Effectiveness on Equine Stomach Ulcers
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Stomach ulcers are common in performance horses; 90 percent of race horses and a large percentage of other performance horses have been shown to have ulcers. There are two types of stomach ulcers in horses because there are two distinct areas of the horse’s stomach. One area is the glandular stomach, which is protected by mucous and other barriers. The most likely cause of ulcers in this area is stress or medications like butazolidine for pain and these ulcers are rare. The most common type of ulcer is in the nonglandular part of the stomach and is generally not related to being given butazolidin but it is related to exercise, diet, and the stress of being kept in a stall and not being allowed to graze. This area of the stomach is not protected and since the horse’s stomach secretes acid continually, horses fed just twice a day in a stall have no protection so ulcers develop, especially when the horses are exercised. The only approved treatment of stomach ulcers is a drug called GastroGard that increases the pH of the stomach by decreasing gastric acid, and it is effective. However, it is expensive especially with long-term treatment and as soon as the drug is stopped, ulcers will recur. There are multiple products on the market that claim to decrease ulcers but there is no evidence to support their use in most cases. However, the vets at LSU performed a study using a commercially available supplement called Smart Gut Ultra Pellets and found that after stopping GastroGard, the Smart Gut product decreased ulcer formation compared to untreated horses.

Category: Treating Equine Stomach Ulcers with Omeprazole
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A large number of performance horses suffer from gastric or stomach ulcers. A recent study reveals a method to make treatment more successful and potentially less expensive. There are 2 different areas in the horse’s stomach. One is the squamous area, and the other is the glandular area This is important because the location of the ulcer helps the veterinarian determine a likely cause and chance of healing. Ulcers in the glandular portion of the stomach are much more difficult to heal than those in the squamous portion. The drugomeprazoleis commonly used to treatgastric ulcers. Although effective in most cases, thedrugis expensive and is used for 30 days. To determine the absorption characteristics of omeprazole, Dr. Ben Sykes from the University of Liverpool performed a study on feeding time and absorption of the drug. He found that compared to giving the drug to fasted horses, feeding hay with the drug decreased absorption up to 66%. This decreased absorption correlated with decreased acid suppression up to 40% of the 24 hour period. If omeprazole is given when the horse has hay available, the horse is not protected from acid for 40% of the day. Also, three out of the six horses tested had little acid suppression at all over a five day period. So, this expensive drug was wasted and could be the reason some horses seemingly do not respond to treatment. Although it is not good to fast horses with stomach ulcers, this report indicates that feeding at 6:00 pm would be okay as long as the horse has consumed all the feed by 10:00 pm and then give the omeprazole at 7:00 am, feeding the horse one hour later for optimal absorption. With higher absorption, it is possible that the dosage could be decreased making the drug less expensive to use for treatment.

Category: Ears
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Veterinarians don’t really feel horses have a lot of ear problems but because of the difficulty in examining the ears of some horses, ear problems may be more plentiful than we think.  I try to examine the ears on every horse I examine or vaccinate and some of them will just not allow the ear exam without sedation.  Many owners will say that the horse has always been that way and just does not like the ears touched, and that may be correct as it may be a behavioral issue.  However, it is also possible the horse does not want the ears examined because there is a problem in the ears and the only method to find out is to look.  I am not suggesting every horse be sedated for an ear exam but if the horse is head shy or does not like the ears touched, it should at least be considered. One problem even with a sedated horse is the ear speculums used for dogs generally are not long enough to visualize the entire ear canal of the horse as the canal is not straight in to the ear drum but makes an acute angle, so the ear drum is hard to see.  A recent paper out of Germany indicated that it is effective to use an endoscope, which most equine vets have in their practice, to look inside the ear canal.  The advantage is the endoscope is flexible and allows the vet to look further in the canal.  The most common cause of ear disease in Texan horses is ear ticks and these can lead to serious problems and infection.  However, the study using the endoscope found that lots of horses with head shaking and vestibular disease also had ear infections that had not been diagnosed.  Some horses had foreign bodies in their ears that lead to shaking and infection and sensitivity.  So, if your horse does not like the ears examined, it may just be your horse.  However, it could also be a problem in the ears that needs to be treated.

Category: Cushing's Diagnosis Using Hair Samples from Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cushing's disease is a fairly common disease in older horses. It is characterized by a long hair coat that does not shed in the summer, laminitis or founder of the feet, and (usually) a crusty neck and large fat deposits around the tail head, as well as other symptoms. This disease is related to a growth on or increased size of the pituitary gland, which causes an increased production of various hormones. The major concern with these horses is that founder can occur, as that can be deadly. However, a recent paper in the Journal of Equine Veterinary Science indicates this disease affects many other organs as well. One interesting finding is the increase in lipofuscin. Lipofuscin is an aging pigment that is an indicator of free radical injury; it accumulates in the nervous tissue of horses with Cushing's disease and even in some normal horses as they age. However, the amount is greater in horses with Cushing's disease, which can lead to degeneration of nervous tissue. The liver in these horses was also affected, so liver function could be decreased. An important finding was a lung inflammation called bronchiolitis in horses with Cushing's disease. This inflammation makes the horses more susceptible to lung infections, and I have seen this in several horses in our practice that have recurrent infections. The heart of these horses was also affected with lipofuscin, indicating free radical damage that can lead to fibrosis or scarring. Along with treating these horses with pergolide, it is possible we should be treating with some type of antioxidative drug to prevent damage to other organs.

Category: Insulin Response in Healthy Older Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many horses are insulin resistant and have a condition called equine metabolic syndrome in which they have an abnormal response to insulin. Increased insulin in the blood can lead to laminitis and subsequent founder.  Laminitis and founder are painful foot conditions that can be deadly in horses.  Some horses are genetically predisposed to have insulin resistance and have high insulin levels after ingesting high-carbohydrate diets, such as high grain diets or, more commonly, lush green pasture.  However, some new research has revealed that older horses are susceptible to insulin dysregulation even if they have not been diagnosed with insulin resistance and therefore need an appropriate diet to prevent laminitis.  Insulin is produced by the horse’s pancreas and when insulin is released, cells remove glucose from the blood and a high level of insulin in the blood can be accompanied by insulin resistance. The Horse Magazine reports researchers at the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition in England and at Michigan State studied insulin dysregulation in older horses, and the best diets to feed and aging.  They studied the insulin response to healthy adult horses and healthy older horses and found the insulin response increases with age even in healthy horses, regardless of the diet they were fed prior to evaluation.  Clare Barfoot from Spillers Nutrition indicated that energy sources used in the diet of senior horses and their effects on insulin need to be carefully considered.  Basically, this means restricting the amount of sugar and starch or nonstructural carbohydrates in the diet of all older horses.  So even if you have an older horse that does not appear to be insulin resistant or have Cushing’s disease, feeding a low carbohydrate food is a good idea.

Category: Monitoring Horses with Cushing’s Disease
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Monitoring Horses with Cushing’s Disease Cushing’s Disease, correctly called pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction or PPID, is common in older horses, but monitoring treatment of these cases is difficult. If you have a horse over 15 years of age, there is a chance your horse could have some degree of Cushing’s Disease. Horses over 25 years of age commonly have some degree of the syndrome although they may not develop clinical signs. The disease causes multiple symptoms, including laminitis, increased water consumption, decreased or increased sweating and long hair that is not shed in the spring. Diagnosis involves testing a hormone level called ACTH, either as a sole test or after injection of another hormone. The disease is treated with the drug pergolide (Prascend), and it can be difficult to determine in follow-up testing if the drug is helping or if the correct dose is being administered. In some horses, clinical signs such as hair shedding can be used to determine if the disease is controlled, but more difficult if laminitis is involved.  In 20-75% of horses treated, there will be a decrease in ACTH when treating with Prascend, but it may not be reduced to a normal level. This is confusing because normal ACTH levels vary during the fall of the year and with stress.  Dr. David Rendle, BVSc, MVM, CertEM, DipECEIM, MRCVS, says that an improvement in clinical signs is the most important parameter. If the blood test value is decreased from pretreatment but not normal and clinical signs are improving, this tells us the drug is working. Blood test monitoring twice a year is recommended, as Cushing’s Disease is progressive, and your horse will likely need a higher dosage as the horse ages. Ask your equine veterinarian about checking your older horse for Cushing’s Disease.

Category: Preventing Founder in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We see a large number of horses in our practice that are overweight and although some of these horses are overfed, most have a syndrome called equine metabolic syndrome. Horses with equine metabolic syndrome were in the past called easy keepers because they gained weight and stayed fat with very little feed. At that point no one knew why this occurred but now we know that these horses are resistant to the effects of insulin. Because of this resistance, horses increase the production of insulin, and increased insulin is why these horses develop laminitis and founder. Insulin levels can be measured and if they are increased, treatment is initiated by decreasing non-structural carbohydrates in the ration. Horses should be fed hay. A 1,000-pound horse should receive about 15 pounds per day. Ideally, the hay should be tested to make sure it is less than 10% nonstructural carbohydrates. Soaking hay in water can decrease the carbohydrates, and that, is a good idea but we recommend testing the hay after it is soaked to see if it is really below the 10% level. If not, it should not be fed to horses with equine metabolic syndrome. These horses should also be fed either a vitamin mineral supplement that contains vitamin E or a low-carbohydrate feed designed for horses with equine metabolic syndrome. Because a horse's major source of carbohydrates is pasture, most of these horses will need very restricted time in the pasture or have pasture eliminated altogether. And since it takes a while for horses to lose weight and we are concerned about horses foundering before they lose weight, giving horses a thyroid supplement can increase insulin sensitivity and aid in weight loss.

Category: Thyroid Supplementation for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although horses do not routinely develop hypothyroidism, many horses are given thyroid supplements. A recent report shows that this supplementation can affect the horse’s heart. A large number of horses are overweight, and in numerous cases, this is due to equine metabolic syndrome, which causes insulin resistance, weight gain, and laminitis and is hereditary in some breeds. Many older horses have Cushing’s Disease, which is related to dysfunction of the pituitary gland and can also cause insulin resistance. Thyroid supplementation is used most commonly in horses to help with weight loss as it increases the basal metabolic rate and decreases insulin resistance, which helps in cases of laminitis. In the past, it was believed that supplementation with thyroid medication was not harmful to horses, and that still may be correct in most cases. However, a recent study published in theJournal of Veterinary Cardiologystates that horses supplemented with thyroid medication are more likely to develop a heart problem called atrial fibrillation (an abnormal rhythm of the heart and a common cardiac problem in horses). The study involved 23 horses with naturally occurring atrial fibrillation, and the results of blood testing found that 60% of the horses had increased thyroid concentrations. These horses also had a higher heart rate, higher systolic blood pressure, and increased thickness of the left ventricular free wall of the heart. Hyperthyroidismis a predisposing factor for atrial fibrillation in humans and seems it can also contribute to this issue in horses. Because of this, supplementing performance horses with thyroid supplementation is not recommended. The decision to add a supplement for insulin resistance with thyroid medication to your horse’s diet should be made on a case-by-case basis and through consultation with your veterinarian.

Category: Corneal Ulcer Treatment in Horses with Cushing's Disease
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A recent study was performed that measured the levels of cortisol in the tear production of horses with cushing's disease and levels of cortisol in the tears of horses with cushing's was found to be higher than normal horses. To explain why this is important, i need to give you a little background about Cushing's disease and to start by saying it has been shown to be in up to 30 percent of the horses over the age of 20. Cushing's disease is correctly called pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction and the acronym is PPID. In Cushing's, the pituitary gland produces increased hormone, which causes the adrenal gland to produce more cortisol and cortisol has multiple effects on the horse's body with the most serious one being susceptibility to laminitis and founder. However, multiple other problems can occur including increased sweating, long hair that does not shed, increased thirst and susceptibility to infection. And the increased susceptibility of infection is where the increased cortisol in the tears can have a serious effect. Horse's eyes are very sensitive and develop infections easily after a simple scratch. Most horses eyes respond to treatment but if a horse develops an eye problem and the tears contain increased cortisol, healing may be delayed. Horses can develop severe infections that can cause them to lose sight in just a few hours and in Texas, horses can develop fungal ulcers that are extremely difficult to treat successfully. So the important thing to remember is that if you have any horse with an eye problem, your vet needs to see it immediately; if the horse is older and could have Cushing's,treatment must be very aggressive to prevent loss of the eye.

Translating Return to English   Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is the most common cause of blindness in horses.  As many as 28 percent of horses were blind in one or both eyes when first examined by an ophthalmologist.  ERU is often referred to as moon blindness.  It was originally thought that these episodes of inflammation, or uveitis, occurred with the phases of the moon.  It is true that ERU is characterized by recurring bouts of inflammation but they do not correlate to the phases of the moon. Equine recurrent uveitis is thought to be an autoimmune disease but the underlying cause and reasons for recurrence have not been completely elucidated.  Just because a horse has an episode of inflammation, or uveitis, does not mean they have ERU.  There are many causes of uveitis, which can in turn result in equine recurrent uveitis if not managed appropriately. Leptospirosis is the most common and well-known infectious organism associated with ERU but the clear association and development of it is still not well understood.  Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease and the organisms are found in rivers, lakes and pond waters as well as sewage. Deer, cattle, pigs and rats are the animals that carry the organism that infects horses.  Horses are infected with this bacterium after drinking water that has been contaminated by urine from one of the above listed animals.  Horses should not be allowed to drink water from ponds or run off areas; rather they should use a designated water trough.  Initial infection with the bacteria is often not noticed but the ocular signs can occur immediately or within 15 to 24 months. Appaloosa, Warmblood and Knabstrupper horses are thought to have a genetic predisposition to ERU.  The disease in these breeds is more of an insidious type of inflammation with chronic low-grade inflammation.  These horses are not obviously painful.  Appaloosas with the leopard complex are eight times more likely to develop equine recurrent uveitis and four times more likely to go blind than any other breed. Differentiating between ERU and non-ERU uveitis is important.  There are many ocular conditions with similar symptoms; squinting, tearing, corneal cloudiness and even blindness.   Treatment options vary widely between ERU and non-ERU uveitis. The initial goal with ERU is to get the inflammatory episode and pain under control.  This can be done with topical or oral steroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, intravitreal injections of low dose gentamicin and/or triamcinolone, suprachoroidal cyclosporine implants, and vitrectomy.  There are pluses and minuses to each treatment plan; discussion with your doctor and ophthalmologist will help you choose the best one for you and your horse.

Category: Excessive Tearing in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Tears running down the side of your horse's face is a common sign noted by many horse owners. There are multiple causes for excessive tearing. Some are important and require a veterinary exam while other causes may be temporary and can clear up without treatment. Remember, however, that the horse's eye is extremely sensitive and anytime a horse's eye is tearing, I believe you should have a vet examine him. If you take the wait and see approach and it is a serious problem, an eye infection can cause blindness in just a few hours so waiting is not a good idea. Excessive tearing can be due to over production of tears or to a lack of drainage. Lack of drainage is due to blockage of the nasolacrimal duct that leads from the eye to the nose. The duct may be infected, swollen, and blocked by mucous, or if the horse is young it may not even be formed correctly. Your veterinarian can flush the duct to see if it is open and functioning correctly. If it is and excessive tearing is still occurring, then too many tears are being produced, which is usually due to some irritation around or in the eye. Usually the inflammation causes pain and any time a horse is squinting, the eye needs to be examined. Pain causing excessive tearing can either be due to inflammation on the outside, such as an infection or tumor in the membranes around the eye, damage to the outer surface of the eye itself, or pain can be due to inflammation inside the eye. Scratches on the cornea can cause pain and excessive tearing; diseases such as uveitis and glaucoma affect the inside, and both cause excessive tearing. Although allergies can cause too much tearing, your vet should examine all eyes that are tearing excessively.

Category: Eye Issues in Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English All newborn foals should have an exam by a veterinarian at 12 hours after birth, and this should include an eye exam. Horse’s eyes are very sensitive and the foal’s eyes are even more sensitive, so it is critical to make sure the eyes are normal at birth. Any amount of swelling around the eyes should always be a concern and if the foal is squinting, then we know the eye is painful and needs to be examined. Any discharge from the foal’s eye is also potentially serious as a severe infection could cause the foal to lose the eye in a matter of hours. Dr. Dennis Brooks indicates in the Horse.com that you can watch the upper eyelid lashes and if the lashes droop or if you see increased blinking of one eye more than the other, the eye is painful. Foals can suffer eye damage at birth but this is mostly hemorrhage from trauma that usually does not cause a permanent problem. Once the foal is on the ground, exposure to all sorts of organisms and environmental irritants occurs and Dr. Steve Roberts indicates corneal ulcers can be a major problem in foals. Dr. Nancy Loving indicates that foals can have many eye conditions at birth, such as cataracts, smaller than normal eyes, and deviation of the eyeball. Also, foals that become sick from diseases unrelated to the eyes are susceptible to eye disease as their immunity is decreased and many sick foals are dehydrated; this causes the globe to sink back into the eye and allows eyelid hairs to rub on the outer surface of the eyeball. So the major point is that if you have a foal and you even think there may be an eye problem, there probably is so have your veterinarian check it out.

Category: Moon Blindness (Recurrent Uveitis) in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The most common cause of blindness in horses is equine recurrent uveitis, also called ERU. ERU is inflammation of structures inside the eye that seems to come and go, and in the past was called moon blindness because it seemed to occur and disappear with different phases of the moon. Of course, this was shown not to be the case and it's actually an immune mediated disease reacting to various antigens, one of the which may be the bacterial organism Leptospira. Appaloosas are the number one breed affected in the United States, although warmbloods are also commonly affected but the disease can occur in any breed. Most horses will show pain in the eye by squinting and having excessive tearing with a blue to white appearance to the cornea. Now it is important to stress there are many equine eye diseases that can cause these symptoms such as corneal ulceration, and these two diseases require totally different treatment. Glaucoma can also appear to be similar and again requires completely different treatment. For this reason, never place an eye ointment in your horse's eye without having your vet first examine the eye. Topical treatment for uveitis consists of cortisone. which cannot be used if there is a corneal ulcer as a fungal infection can develop that can lead to blindness. With uveitis, the eye should be dilated with atropine, which should not be done if glaucoma is involved. As far as products at the feed store that indicate they can be used in the horse's eye,please do not use themas many may cause damage to the eye, and time spent treating with these products allows the disease to progress; this is valuable time that should be used treating the horse as your vet suggests.

Category: Ocular Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses may have the most sensitive eyes of all domestic animals. Many animals may have a slight discharge from the eye or may squint, and although the eye should be examined by a veterinarian it is not as critical in as many cases as in a horse. However, if a horse is squinting or an eye exhibits excessive tearing, you don’t want to wait and see what happens because horses can get such severe infections that they can go blind in just a few hours. Some horses may just have conjunctivitis, which is inflammation of the tissues around the eyeball. This is generally an easily treatable condition as long as there is no foreign body in the eye causing the problem, such as a piece of grass. Because of this possibility, it is essential for your veterinarian to numb your horse’s eye and check for foreign material under the eyelids. The most common and potentially serious condition of the horse’s eye is a corneal ulcer due to a scratch from a piece of foreign material. Many ulcers are superficial and will heal with just antibiotic eyedrops used for about a week. However, some ulcers can be severe and deep and can cause the eye to rupture in just a few hours, usually leading to blindness. You should never place ointment in your horse’s eye without having your veterinarian examine it. Many ointments for human and animal eyes have cortisone, and using cortisone in a horse’s eye with an ulcer can lead to a severe fungal infection and rupture of the eyeball. There are many other diseases of the horse’s eye, including glaucoma and other types of inflammation. So if you feel your horse has an eye problem, never place any ointment in the eye until your veterinarian has examined the eye.

Category: Squamous Cell Carcinoma in a Horse's Eyelid
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The most common tumor on the horse’s eyelid is a squamous cell carcinoma; this is the same tumor than causes cancer eye in cattle.  Predisposing factors that increase the chance of this tumor occurring are similar to those in cattle, as horses lacking pigmentation around the eye or that have light-colored faces are more susceptible to these tumors due to UV light exposure.  The tumor can occur on the eyelids, cornea, or third eyelid and may initially appear as a small red inflamed area that will eventually enlarge and can cover the entire eye.  For this reason, it is important to monitor your horse’s eyes, especially those with white around their eyes, for small bumps on the eyelids, or tearing in one eye more than another. Many times, horses with small squamous cell carcinomas only have inflammation of the conjunctival tissue around the globe and the horse’s response may appear similar to dust allergies.  If your horse has an eye that seems to be affected, call your vet so they can take a biopsy to determine if an infection, dust or a tumor could be involved.  If a squamous cell carcinoma is diagnosed, multiple treatments are available including freezing the tumor, surgical removal, hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and injecting various chemotherapeutic agents.  One chemotherapeutic agent that is inexpensive and can be injected in the tumor is the chemical 5 fu.  A recent report out of Oklahoma State reveals this chemical can reduce the tumor size although it is unlikely to completely cure the tumor.  However, reducing the tumor may eliminate clinical signs and allow surgical removal or other treatment.  If your horse has inflamed areas in or around the eyes, a tumor could be involved so call your veterinarian.

Category: Summer Sores are around a Horse's Eye
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English You may have heard the term summer sores before but may not know much about these lesions. Summer sores, technically called habronemiasis, are lesions on the skin or around the eyes. They can be caused by any one of three parasite larvae transmitted by house and stable flies. Larvae are deposited by flies on the skin, and larvae causes ulcerated and bleeding non-healing lesions. These lesions contain small yellow granules that generally make the horse itchy. A biopsy is required for the diagnosis because sarcoids and squamous cell carcinoma lesions appear similar to summer sores. Treatment of habronemiasis involves surgical removal of the lesion, if possible, or at least decreasing the size of the lesion with surgery. Cortisone has been effective in many cases of habronemiasis as the condition is believed to be a hypersensitivity reaction to the parasite. The cortisone treatment can be given in the feed or orally, injected directly into the lesions, or used topically on the lesion’s surface. Many of the topical medications also contain antibiotics as well as medciation to kill the larvae. All horses should also be treated with ivermectin orally as it has been shown to kill the larvae as well as adult worms of the parasites in the horse’s stomach. Ivermectin is also one the products that is routinely used for deworming and this is one reason we see many less summer sore cases today than 40 years ago as when deworming for regular parasites, you are also killing some larvae that lead to summer sores before a problem develops. Another key to decreasing summer sores in horses is fly control, which is very important in treating summer sores.

Category: Vision in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on the program we are going to talk about vision in horses and what a horse sees and doesn't see compared to humans. First of all, vision is not just about the eye itself as it has to do transmission of the information to the brain, and the brain processing the information. Dr's. Paul Miller and Chris Murphy indicate that because horses have one of the largest eyes of all land-based animals, they allow more light to enter the eye, which greatly improves their vision in dim light situations. The pupil and cornea are also elongated horizontally, which again increases admission of light to the eye. The horse's pupil can dilate six times larger than the human's pupil.This is why the horse can see objects at night that humans can not see. However, the horse's depth perception is much worse than humans because much of the horse's visual field involves only one eye. Only about 70 percent of the horse's vision utilizes both eyes so this decreases depth perception. This is the reason many horses balk when seeing objects as they can not tell how far away they really are. The horse's visual acuity is not as good as humans because by having the increased ability to see at night decreases the accuracy of their vision. A person whose eye tests indicate 20/20 vision means that the test subject can see objects from 20 feet that a person with normal vision could see at 20 feet. And a person with 20/100 vision could see an object as close as 20 feet what a person with normal vision would see as far away as 100 feet. In comparison, the horse's vision is believed to be from 20/40 up to 20/60. So a horse would have to be 20 feet from an object to see it with the same clarity as a person at 60 feet.

Category: Blood Loss from Lacerations in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most common frantic calls we get at the clinic is horse owners saying their horse has been cut and is bleeding profusely, so today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about first aid in bleeding cases. First of all, it is important that you remain as calm as possible because the more excited you are, the more excited your horse will be and excitement increases blood pressure. Increased blood pressure leads to increased bleeding, so stay as calm as possible. Secondly, unless you talk to your veterinarian, do not give any medication, especially sedatives. These drugs can be dangerous in a normal horse and the use of these drugs in a bleeding horse can decrease the blood pressure too much. If the horse has lost a significant amount of blood, the sedative can cause the blood pressure to drop so low that the horse can fall and injure itself as well as nearby people. Although bleeding can be scary, it is extremely unusual that a horse would bleed to death unless a major vessel is damaged, such as the jugular vein or uterine artery. Most lacerations occur on the lower legs and even though horses look like they are bleeding a lot from cuts there, the vessels are fairly small and the likelihood of losing too much blood is slim if a bandage is used. If your horse is bleeding, wrap the leg tightly. It is important to have a non-stick pad to place over the wound, roll gauze to hold the bandage on the wound, and a full thickness of cotton to place around the wound with tight Vet Wrap on top. One trick is to place a rock or other hard small object directly over the bleeding artery, after applying the nonstick pad and gauze, to place pressure directly over the artery and help stop the bleeding.

Category: CPR in Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is commonly used in human medicine and is used in animals as well. In adult horses, it is technically impossible to give CPR due to the size of the animals. However, it can be helpful in foals and today we are going to talk about this procedure. CPR is indicated in any case in which the foal stops breathing or does not have a heartbeat. The most important thing is to have personnel ready if you have a mare that you think might be giving birth to a compromised foal. Newborn foals born from mares with high risk pregnancies should be assumed to be compromised and may require CPR. Foals born when mares have a problem delivering, born too early, delivered by Caesarean section, or born from mares with a uterine infection called placentitis all may need CPR to survive. A normal foal should be breathing about 1 breath per second 30 seconds at birth and the heart beat should also be regular at about 1 beat per second. Any foals that have a lower respiratory rate or heart rate than about 1 per second may require resuscitation. All foals should be dried immediately after birth and fluid should be cleared from their mouths and noses. The foal's head can be lowered to aid in clearing fluid but the foal should not be suspended by its hindlimbs. If the foal is not breathing, the best method to get air into the foal is to pass a tube through the nose into the trachea, but this procedure requires a veterinarian. Be sure and join me for the next program for more on CPR in foals.

Category: CPR in New-borne Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A large percentage of foals that die shortly after birth do so because of a lack of oxygen; more foals die from respiratory problems than heart problems. Newborn foals that do not begin breathing spontaneously, are gasping, have a respiratory rate of less than 10 per minute, a heart rate less than 60 per minute, and are not responsive to stimulation all require resuscitation. As soon as the foal is born, the foal should be aggressively dried by rubbing and the foal's airway should be manually cleared. The nose should be manually cleared of fetal membranes and mucous. You can use a large bulb syringe if necessary or a 60cc syringe with rubber tubing on the end. Although many have recommended holding foals upside down to help clear the airways, this is no longer recommended as holding the foal upside down has been shown to inhibit breathing. Also, slapping, shaking, and spanking the foal is not recommended. If bleeding from the umbilicus is substantial it is okay to clamp the cord but in general this is not recommended and tying off the cord is not a good idea. As far as breathing, if the foal is not breathing or the heart rate is below 60, artificial breathing is required. The best method for doing this is to pass a tube into the trachea through the nose or mouth and then resuscitate the foal with a breathing bag. This is not an easy procedure and in most cases, your vet will be required unless your vet has instructed you on this procedure and you have the equipment. It is a good idea to have an inexpensive stethoscope around because if the foal's heart rate is below 60 beats per minute or if the breathing rate is less than 10 breaths per minute, your vet should be called.

Category: Emergency Care for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have horses, at some point you will be faced with an emergency. The first thing to do, of course, is to call your vet. But until your vet arrives, there are some things you can do to help your horse. A common injury is a puncture in the foot by a nail or some other object. Most horses will immediately develop severe lameness and anytime this occurs you should check your horse’s foot for foreign objects. If you find a nail or other object, Dr. Mark Fitch from Colorado recommends removing the nail and I agree. Many vets recommend leaving the nail in the hoof until they arrive so they can see where the puncture occurred. However, the more the horse walks on the nail, the greater the possible damage. So remove the nail and clean the hoof but it is imperative that you draw a map or somehow mark the exact location of the puncture because your vet will need to know this when they arrive. These punctures will close quickly and will not be easy to find without marking after the nail is removed. Your vet will usually place a metal probe in the nail track and may even x-ray the hoof with the probe in place to determine the depth of the puncture. Although many nail punctures are not this serious and you may not consider them emergencies, some are life threatening. If the nail or other object entered a joint or tendon sheath, the resulting infection can be deadly so all of these punctures should be considered emergencies. Your vet will check the location to determine if the wound is serious. Another emergency occurs if your horse gets a cut on the lower leg and almost all of these cuts will require wrapping. Join us on our next program when I will discuss the best method for wrapping your horse's leg wounds.

Category: Exhausted Horse Syndrome
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English With the upcoming heat and humidity, horse owners with performance horses need to be familiar with exhausted horse syndrome. The University of Kentucky shows in the publication The Horse that exhausted horse syndrome refers to multiple conditions of horses becoming fatigued. Affected horses appear stiff or weak, and some show decreased energy or appetite. In serious cases, irregular heartbeat, shock, muscle damage, colic, and diarrhea can develop. Under-conditioned horses performing in heat and humidity are more likely to experience the condition. Exhaustion has multiple causes that include heat, electrolyte imbalance, and energy stores. Your horse removes body heat by sweating and with air movement. If these do not occur, core body temperature increases. The primary energy source for muscles is stored sugar, or glycogen, and when this is used up with exercise, your horse will slow down or stop exercising. If you are riding and think your horse may have exhausted horse syndrome, stop at once and do not move your horse. Call your veterinarian. Cool your horse by running large amounts of water over the entire body. Intravenous fluids may be needed to help cool your horse. If the digestive tract is functioning, giving fluids with a tube through the nose can also help, as long as your horse is not having colic symptoms. If colic symptoms are present with abnormal gut sounds, the stomach should remain empty. Exhaustion can be prevented with proper training, nutrition, electrolyte supplements, and allowing time for your horse to become acclimated to new environments.

Category: First Aid for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English During nice weather, most of you with horses will be out on trail rides and other equine activities, and you need to be prepared for emergencies. First of all, make sure you have a regular veterinarian that is available for emergencies, so call ahead of time to find out about your vets emergency coverage. If you do not have a regular vet, call one today. In the long run, having your vet examine your horse on a regular basis is important to your horse's health. However, some first aid will be required for certain conditions until your vet can arrive and I am going to start with cuts on your horse. It is extremely unlikely your horse will bleed to death from a cut unless the jugular vein is involved or other major vessels. Most bleeding will stop if constant pressure is applied to the bleeding area. If the laceration is on the leg, applying a tight wrap with thick cotton padding will stop most bleeding. Cutting off the circulation is not a concern if you use enough padding and the wrap is used for a short period. In a fresh wound, avoid using any chemical to stop bleeding because if these products are used, your vet will most likely not be able to suture the wound. Rinsing a wound with water is okay but applying any products to the wound is not a good idea until your vet examines the wound. Make sure you have an emergency first aid kit with telfa pads, brown roll gauze, a large amount of roll cotton, and vet wrap. You can purchase padded wraps but if you are trying to place pressure on a bleeding vessel, regular cotton works the best. Unfortunately, in a colic situation, there is not a lot of first aid you can other than call your vet. You can get your horse up and walking and sometimes this will help but all colic cases are potentially serious. For this reason, I do not recommend administering any medication for pain until a vet examines the horse. Many people have access to Banamine and tend to administer it to colic cases. However, there are some concerns and one is that Banamine, although labelled to give in the muscle, must never be given in the muscle as it can lead to a serious muscle infection so the injection must be given in the vein. Also, it is possible the horse could appear to respond to the pain mediation and yet intestinal damage could be increasing in the abdomen, which would cause a potential delay in further treatment and this delay could be deadly. Lastly, many people have oral Banamine paste and administer it for colic cases. This is also not a good idea as the medication may only reach the horse's stomach and not even be absorbed and yet will limit use of the drug by your vet when they arrive. Something you can do to help your vet determine the severity when you call is to check your horse's pulse and breathing rate as well as the rectal temperature. Another item to check is the capillary refill time on the gums as well as the moisture on the gums to look for dehydration. On your next vet visit, ask your vet to help you so you can assess these parameters in an emergency.

Translating Return to English One of the common injuries we see in horses is one to the hoof wall, in which the hoof wall is detached from the underneath tissue; this is correctly called an avulsion of the hoof wall.  Some of these injuries involve only the hoof wall but others also involve the coronary band.  If the hoof wall has become detached from the underneath tissue, it must be removed surgically.  If the coronary band is involved, sometimes it can be sutured.  It is important to have your veterinarian examine any wound to the foot as there are a lot of serious structures in the hoot that can be deadly if involved.  Your veterinarian will check to make sure that no joints or tendon sheaths are involved, and will also clean and flush the area well. The hoof will likely have to be numbed with local anesthetic to carefully examine the area; if no other structures are involved, skin and coronary band tissue can be sutured and the hoof wall that has become detached can be removed.  The hoof is then bandaged after applying antibiotic medication.  In some cases, the hoof wall can become completely unattached and has to be surgically removed.  Even in this case, the horse can survive if the wound is treated properly although a long period of treatment is involved.  Failure to treat these hoof wall injuries will certainly lead to a defect in the hoof wall, and those usually lead to lameness. If your horse has an injury to the hoof wall or any area on the lower leg, again these wounds in this area can be deadly.  It is important to have all of these wounds examined immediately by your veterinarian as delaying treatment of foot and lower leg wounds can be very serious.  If you have other questions about treating a hoof wall injury, contact me at texvet@txfb.org.

Category: Antibiotic Use in Horse Reproduction
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most common causes of infertility in mares is an infection in the uterus. However, many mares are treated for infections even though they might not actually be infected. Just because a culture of the uterus reveals an infectious organism does not mean this organism is a real pathogen causing a problem. Consequently, it is important to also look at the uterine cells under a microscope to make sure there is actual inflammation and the mare really is infected. For uterine infections, it is common to infuse antibiotics in the uterus; this is the method that has been used for many years for treatment. However, it is important to know that a lot of these mares have material in their uterus that will inactivate the antibiotics, so it is always a good idea to flush the uterus with large volumes of sterile solutions before infusing. Most mares need antibiotics infused in the uterus for 3 to 7 days, depending on the infection. Also, systemic use of antibiotics has been shown to reach high concentrations in the uterus and can be effective for treating uterine infections. Systemic antibiotic treatment means that you are giving antibiotics orally or by injection rather than placing them directly in the uterus. The advantage of treating with systemic antibiotics is you do not have to physically enter the uterus daily and potentially contaminant the uterus. A disadvantage is that a longer treatment period is required and only certain antibiotics are effective. If the uterine infection is due to an anatomic abnormality of the genital area, no infection will be cured long term until the abnormality is surgically repaired.

Category: Biosecurity for Show Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you are hauling your horses from your property, biosecurity is important to prevent infectious disease.  Exposing your horses to other horses increases the risk of certain diseases like equine herpes virus, equine influenza and strangles. Vaccinations do not always prevent disease but do decrease severity of clinical signs. The vaccine for equine herpes virus, while usually effective in preventing the respiratory form and abortion, does not prevent the more serious neurological form of the disease. Vaccines to prevent strangles in your horse are available and although routinely recommended, they are not 100% protective. Dr. Chris White, DVM, states in the publication “The Horse”, that traveling and showing horses contributes to stress, lowering horses’ immunity and making them more susceptible to disease. The larger the show, the greater chance for disease transmission, as horses may be attending from all over the country. It is important to make sure your horse is currently vaccinated by your veterinarian and it’s ideal if your horse attends shows that require vaccinations of all horses.  Prevent your horses from having direct contact with other horses as much as possible, and don’t share equipment like water buckets or brushes with other show attendees.  Giving probiotics can possibly boost your horse’s immunity.  When returning home, always isolate your show horses from the rest of your herd for 3 weeks and monitor their temperatures to make sure they remain normal before adding them back in your herd. Having a separate barn for your show horses would be a good idea during show season.

Category: Botulism is Being Seen more Frequently in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Amy Johnson from the University of Pennsylvania indicated at the Veterinary Internal Medicine Conference that cases of botulism are increasing in horses. Botulism is a bacterial disease that produces toxins in feed, and these toxins are ingested when the horses eats. Botulism usually occurs when feeding round bales of hay or improper cured silage as well as hay that contains decaying dead animals such as mice in the hay.The toxin of botulism causes progressive muscle weakness and many horses will get down and be unable to rise. The most typical sign of botulism is the horse’s inability to swallow and use the tongue. Some horses also have difficulty breathing and have colic but horses with colic are in pain when lying down and horses with botulism are calm once they are lying down. Testing for botulism is difficult because a mouse bioassay is the recommended test but it requires at least 5 days and can have false negatives. Many times the diagnosis is made on clinical signs and the fact that the disease may be commonly seen in the area. One of the exam tests used is the tongue test; for this test, the tongue is pulled from the mouth and if it hangs from the mouth for a longer than normal period, botulism is suspected. Treatment of botulism involves the use of antitoxin and supportive care. There a vaccine to prevent type B botulism but it does not protect against the other types. Unfortunately, adult horses only have about a 50% to 90% survival rate if infected with botulism.

Category: Brucellosis from Raw Milk Consumption
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Recently a case of brucellosis was diagnosed in a Texas man from drinking raw milk from a licensed raw milk dairy.  Brucellosis is a bacterial disease of cattle that was very common in Texas 50 years ago but is now rarely found due to vaccination and testing.  However, it is still in some areas and the bacteria is transmitted in the milk as well as fetal fluids at calving to other animals and people.  There are also other diseases that can be carried in raw milk, which is the reason for pasteurization as this process kills the organisms. Raw milk is not pasteurized.  Other animals commonly affected with brucellosis include sheep, goats, pigs and others.  The disease can also cause fistulous withers that is a draining tract at the withers in horses and is a cause of infection of the vertebrae indogs. In humans, symptoms include fever, sweats, decreased appetite, headache, pain in muscles and fatigue, or basically flu-like symptoms that do not respond to normal treatment.  The condition is called undulant fever in humans because it can recur for long periods of time and can cause heart valve infection, swelling of the liver and spleen and abortion in pregnant women. Brucellosis is a very serious disease in animals and people and drinking raw milk should be discouraged as the risks of developing disease are not worth taking the chance.   Death rarely occurs with the disease but many people have recurring symptoms that can last a lifetime, which was common before antibiotics were discovered.  Fortunately, today the disease responds to antibiotics in most humans.  However, drinking raw milk or feeding it to your pets, just like feeding raw meat to your pets, is dangerous for you and your family and is not worth the risk.

Category: Canker in a Horse's Hoof
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine canker is an uncommon but serious problem that can affect a horse’s foot.  Thrush is a bacterial infection that affects the horse’s frog and causes a black, foul-smelling discharge and results in deteriorated tissue.  Although canker is also an infectious process caused by bacteria, it causes abnormal growth of tissue in the frog that resembles off-white cauliflower in color and texture, so these conditions are very different even though canker can also have a foul odor.  Lots of folks assume their horses have thrush and treat for it when canker is the real problem. Thrush treatment will have no effect as canker needs to be treated with surgery. Although canker can be diagnosed on clinical appearance, sometimes a biopsy is needed.  The infective and proliferative tissue must be surgically removed with a scalpel blade. The procedure can be done while the horse is standing after numbing the foot with a local anesthetic and applying a tourniquet to control bleeding.  After removing the infected tissue, the surgical site should be frozen with cryotherapy to remove all adjacent surface bacteria. Then the veterinarian will apply an astringent dressing with antibiotics and bandage the foot until the tissue is cornified and healed.  It is critical to keep the foot absolutely dry, so the horse must be kept in a dry covered stall with shavings that will absorb moisture.  Although we do not know the cause of canker, Dr. Steve O’Grady indicates it does not appear to be caused by unsanitary conditions as most of the horses he sees with the condition are well managed.

Category: Contagious Disease Prevention in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Recently the equine industry in the United States has been focused on equine herpes virus and preventing spread of the disease. Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about some of the measures you can take to prevent not only herpes but other contagious diseases from infecting your horses both at your stable and when hauling your horse to other facilities. Direct physical contact is required for transmission of many organisms but many organisms can also be transmitted when a person touches multiple horses without washing their hands. Also, tack, buckets, and shoes can act as inanimate carriers and spread infection when used on multiple horses, so these items should be disinfected between horses. If you travel to an event and discover horses there have been sick, it is a good idea to take your horse's temperature twice a day and anything over 101.5 degrees should be a concern. Use your own trailer when possible and avoid hauling horses from other farms. Also, all trailers should be disinfected between horses if horses are hauled from different farms; this means removing the rubber mats and cleaning thoroughly. When you take your horse to an event, try to park as far as possible from other horses and keep your horses at your trailer except when participating in the event. Riding around on your horse visiting other folks may be fun but increases the chance of your horse getting sick. And if you are at a stable with other horses, hopefully the stable has a biosecurity policy that requires all horses returning from shows be isolated for at least 2 weeks. Although this may seem extreme and may be difficult, it should be required at all stables to prevent contamination of the entire facility.

Category: Corona is a Fairly New Viral Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A fairly new disease affecting horses in the United States is corona virus. Thirty years ago, this virus was founds in foals and other immunocompromised individuals, but over the last 10 years the virus has started causing disease in adult horses. In 2011, there were several outbreaks in the northeast. Now it appears the disease is occurring in Texas, as it was reported and successfully treated at the veterinary school at Louisiana State University. The disease causes moderate to mild colic, decreased appetite, fever, dehydration, and sometimes secondary infection. Fortunately, the disease is rarely fatal if treated correctly. However, many times treatment will require intravenous fluid therapy to prevent dehydration and this is not easy or inexpensive as hospitalization is usually required. Currently, no vaccine can prevent corona virus. It is contagious from horse to horse through fecal contamination. Therefore, isolation is also required for infected animals, and this can be difficult and expensive in most cases. An infected horse can shed the virus for 21 days, so it is critical to isolate all infected horses for three weeks as well as thoroughly cleaning the environment. Corona virus can also affect other animals and humans but the equine corona virus only affects horses, so there is no concern about transmission to other species. If a horse develops diarrhea, decreased appetite and fever, corona virus could be involved, and your veterinarian should be notified early on to treat this disease.

Category: Dewormer Resistance Increasing in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Intestinal parasites are a common problem in horses. Intestinal parasites can have a negative effect on horse's health, and deworming medications that have been used for many decades to kill intestinal parasites have done a really good job. In fact, the dewormers have really been too effective and have been used too often over the years, which has led to resistance. Many of the dewormers that were effective 30 years ago are basically ineffective at this time against small strongyles, which is the most important equine intestinal parasite in horses today. When these dewormers first came on the market, the recommendation was to deworm all horses every 8 weeks. Unfortunately, this recommendation allowed some parasites to become resistant and using dewormers every 8 weeks only killed the susceptible parasites and allowed the resistant ones to increase. For this reason, the only deworming products that are effective at this time against small strongyles are ivermectin and moxidectin, or Quest. When these products were first released in the 80s and 90s, parasite eggs did not reappear in the feces after deworming for up to 13 weeks for ivermectin and up to 22 weeks for Quest. Now, due to horse owners continuing to deworm their horses with ineffective products and deworming too often, the reappearance of eggs after ivermectin has dropped from 13 weeks to 6 weeks and for Quest from 22 weeks to 8 weeks. For this reason, horses should not be dewormed unless their fecal samples are checked by your vet once a year. Instead of going to the feed store and buying a dewormer, have your vet check your horses and recommend which products to buy. Your veterinarian will also discuss when to use them to decrease future resistance of worms on your farm because no new dewormers are being developed.

Category: Disease Protection at Horse Shows
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In the summer, it seems like everyone goes to horse shows. One concern about horse shows is exposing your horse to the diseases of other horses. This problem became big news in early 2012 when an outbreak of neurologic equine herpes virus developed at a national cutting horse show in Utah. Many horses were exposed, several were infected, and a few died or were euthanized. Anytime you go to a horse show, you risk your horse’s health but there are some things you can do to prevent disease transmission. First of all, make sure your horse is vaccinated by your veterinarian because your vet knows which brands of vaccine are the most effective for the diseases in your area. Vaccination would not have helped in the herpes outbreak because there is no vaccine approved to protect against the neurological strain of herpes. However, there are other vaccines that will prevent contagious diseases so vaccination is important. Always bring your own feed and water buckets and never share with other horses without disinfecting. Try to avoid nose to nose contact with other horses as much as possible as most of the contagious diseases are transmitted through respiratory secretions. Anytime you are involved with other people's horses, wash your hands or disinfect with a 62% alcohol gel product. Since early detection of infection is important, Dr. Roberta Dwyer from the University of Kentucky indicates in Equine Disease Quarterly to take all your horse’s temperatures twice a day. After returning home from a show, continuing to take your horse’s temperature for two weeks after returning, and if you have other horses, quarantine the show horses from the rest of your herd for two weeks.

Category: Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis (EPM) Diagnosis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Probably the most over-diagnosed equine disease is EPM, or equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. Dr. Amy Johnson indicates in the horse.com that the reason is that there are multiple diseases that can resemble EPM including Wobbler syndrome, equine herpes virus, West Nile virus, eastern and western encephalitis, trauma, and even rabies. Symptoms include nervous system disease and maybe an unusual lameness. EPM is difficult to diagnose because although there are multiple blood tests for the disease, none of them are 100 percent and there are a lot of false positives. There is also testing of cerebrospinal fluid, and the most accurate test compares blood results to spinal fluid results. However, there can also be false positives with spinal fluid testing, and which is more expensive and not without some risk. Because of this, many veterinarians perform a neurological exam and if they rule out all other neurological diseases, they assume it is EPM and treat. Then there are vets that do not do any testing and just start treating for EPM without attempting to rule out other diseases. I understand why this is done, but the problem is that EPM treatment is expensive at around $800 for the first month and some vets recommend treating for two months. This is really expensive if the horse does not even have EPM and has another disease as that money is wasted. Secondly, if you spend one to two months treating for EPM and another disease is involved, you have allowed the real disease to proceed for two months while treating incorrectly. As far as prevention, try to keep opossums out of your barn as they are the definitive host of the infectious organism. Keep your horse’s stress level as low as possible as stress can decrease immunity and allow EPM to develop.

Category: Foal Diarrhea Caused by Lawsonia
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about a fairly new intestinal disease of young horses caused by the bacteriumLawsonia. The disease affects weanling foals from 3 to 13 months of age and symptoms include fever, lethargy, a decreased appetite, diarrhea, colic and weight loss. Another symptom that appears to be common with this disease is edema or fluid that develops under the skin due to a decrease in protein absorption from the intestinal tract. Dr. Nicola Pusterla indicated at the AAEP convention that it is important to identify sick foals early and separate them from the rest of the herd to prevent transmission of the bacterium. Any foals that only have mild edema, a slight fever or mild decrease in appetite should be examined by your veterinarian. An ultrasound exam of the foal's intestine can reveal the increased thickness that is common withLawsonia, and fecal and blood tests can be used to make the diagnosis. Most foals will need to be treated with antibiotics, anti-ulcer medication, and intravenous fluids as well as intravenous plasma to replace lost protein. Other foals that have been exposed should be watched closely and have their protein levels checked as low protein levels in the blood are typical of this disease. This disease has become common and has become endemic on many farms, meaning the organism is present on the farm and disease is likely to recur. A vaccine approved for swine has been used experimentally on foals and it was effective in preventing the disease. Most foals affected withLawsoniado well with treatment as long as the diagnosis is made early and aggressive treatment is used.

Category: Guttural Pouch Infections in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A structure in the horse’s respiratory system called the guttural pouch is unique to equine animals and a few other species. It is a pouch or pocket off of the respiratory tract in the horse’s throat area, adjacent to the Eustachian tube. Some people believe the function of these guttural pouches is to allow the arteries that carry blood to the brain to be cooled during intensive exercise because the pouch is lined by a thin membrane that covers the internal carotid artery. These pouches contain major arteries and nerves. Multiple diseases can occur in the guttural pouch. The most common is a secondary infection after a strangles infection, which is bacterial. The pouch can fill with infectious material and the horse can continue to spread the infection to other horses even after the horse has no clinical signs. Treatment requires flushing the guttural pouch and packing it with antibiotics. Another concern with the guttural pouch is a fungal infection called guttural pouch mycosis. Dr. Nathan Slovis indicates this infection can be a life-threatening disease as the internal carotid artery that I mentioned is only covered by a thin membrane. If the fungus destroys the membrane and artery, severe and even deadly bleeding can occur. The fungus can also affect some of the cranial nerves in the area and can lead to difficulty eating and swallowing. Treatment for the fungal infection usually requires surgery as treating this particular infection with antifungal medications are usually not effective. The best treatment is surgery in which a balloon is inserted in the artery to block the blood supply to the fungus. Without a blood supply, the fungus will die. So if your horse has a nasal discharge, especially if it is bloody, call your vet for an exam of the guttural pouches The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Herpes Virus in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Recently the equine world has been dominated by information about equine herpes virus 1. Part of this information has been correct but unfortunately a lot of misinformation has also been available, especially on the Internet. Today I am briefly going to cover the facts about the disease, although there are still lots of things that we do not know about this virus. Equine herpes virus causes three different syndromes: respiratory disease, abortion, and neurological disease. Most horses are exposed to this herpes virus when they are very young and the virus is able to remain dormant in the horse's body and not produce any clinical signs until some trigger causes the virus to become active. There are two basic strains of the virus, the regular strain that causes respiratory disease and a more pathogenic strain that causes neurologic disease that can lead to death. However, even the regular strain can cause nervous system disease, so the problem is not that simple. There are vaccines to prevent herpes virus disease in horses but these vaccines are not 100% and there is no vaccine approved to prevent the nervous system disease. However, there are some vaccines that have a higher amount of antigen than others and it is recommended to use these vaccines to booster horses before exposure to other horses when an outbreak is occurring. The vaccines are not expected to prevent disease but to decrease viral shedding. If a horse has already been exposed to the virus, vaccination is not recommended. The most important factor in prevention of the disease is isolation and quarantine of the infected horses because the disease is very contagious.

Category: Herpes Virus Vaccination in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most serious infectious neurological diseases that affects horses is the neurological form of equine herpes virus. This virus caused all the problems at a big Quarter Horse event in Utah several years ago where several horses died. Equine herpes virus 1 causes this form of herpes, and there are vaccines available to protect against herpes virus. However, the vaccines are only labelled to protect horses against the respiratory form and the one that causes abortion; none are labelled for protection against the neurological form. In fact, the neurological form has occurred in horses that were well vaccinated. Some people that believe vaccination may actually increase the chance of horses developing the neurological form. So the ability of vaccines to protect against the neurological form is unknown. Because of this lack of understanding, a study was performed at Oklahoma State to attempt to determine the ability of vaccine to be protective. Six aged mares were vaccinated three times with Pneumabort-K, which is a high antigen vaccine, and another six mares were used as controls and not vaccinated. There are several different vaccines available for herpes virus and some have higher antigen loads than others. After three vaccinations at monthly intervals, all horses were exposed to a neurological strain of the virus. Results showed five of the six unvaccinated horses had more severe disease versus only one of the six vaccinated horses having severe disease. In this study, horses vaccinated with a high antigen vaccine had less severe clinical signs than unvaccinated horses. Ask your veterinarian about vaccination against equine herpes virus.

Category: Hoof Care in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The old saying "no hoof, no horse" is really true. If your horse's feet have problems, then the horse is basically unusable. Hoof care is critical to prevent lameness problems, and Dr. Robin Dabareiner from Texas A&M indicates in Remuda magazine that the environment has a major effect on the horse's hoof. Hoof quality can vary from farm to farm in the same area due to different drainage issues and different temperatures can also have an effect. June through August in Texas is usually hot and dry and the horse's feet get extremely dry and hard. Because of this, it is difficult to diagnose a problem such as an abscess, sole bruising, or even laminitis. Most horses will have much slower hoof growth during the hot time of the year and because the hoof dries out, the hoof wall and sole separates and when dirt or sand is pushed into the separation, the hoof wall breaks out leaving the horse walking on the sole and not the wall. This can lead to bruising, abscesses, and hoof wall cracks.During these dry times, it is important to use a product to increase moisture in the hoof, such as Hoof Maker or Valentines Dressing. It is important to use a lanolin-based product and not an oil-based product as oil can prevent the hoof from breathing. The moisture provided by these products causes the hoof to grow during the dry summer and you can apply these products to the wall and sole every other day during the hot dry summer. As the weather changes in the fall and winter and we start getting some rain, the hooves get softer and flatten out, which can lead to other problems. As the ground becomes wet, these dry feet pick up moisture, causing the hooves to get softer and the hoof flattens out, which can cause increased bruising. Also, too much moisture can cause the hoof wall to separate. Dr. Dabareiner uses a good analogy of this syndrome by comparing it to separating in same way that wet plywood separates. When the wall breaks off, nails for the shoe must be placed even higher, and that further weakens the wall. This can lead to white line disease, abscesses, thrush, or canker. Treatment required is drying out the hoof wall and sole so the first thing to do is get the horse out of the water and into a dry stall. Applying a product like Durasole to the hoof wall and sole can aid in drying the hoof. Even wet dew on the grass can cause enough moisture to create a problem. In the morning, the feet get wet and then dry out in the afternoon, and then they are wet again the next morning and the cycle continues. The hoof wall separates, nails loosen, and the horse loses a shoe and maybe the farrier is blamed but in most cases it is not the farrier's fault. The same problem can occur when horses at pasture in the summer walk into the farm pond to drink and get their feet wet and then the feet dry out. All of this leads to brittle, cracking hoof walls. When owners see the hooves cracking, they may let their water trough run over to try to water the feet. But watering only compounds the problem and the best treatment is to use a hoof sealant to seal the feet.

Category: Horses Are Susceptible to the COVID-19 Virus
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many animals, including horses, are susceptible to the COVID-19 virus but generally do not get sick. Dr. Pusterla, DVM, Ph.D., DACVIM, DAVDC-Equine, from UC Davis, said at the AAEP convention that a small percentage of healthy racehorses recently tested positive for COVID-19 following a human COVID-19 outbreak in California. This suggests that horses may silently carry the virus and potentially contribute to its spread. There is some concern that the virus could suddenly adapt to a different species and then bounce back to people. Horses do have a spike protein receptor that is like the one in humans, which suggests they might also be able to get and transmit the virus. Spike proteins allow viruses to enter host cells and cause infection. Dr. Pusterla ran measurable PCR tests (a test used to detect materials in a virus, in this case, COVID-19) on nasal secretions from 667 horses experiencing acute onset of fever and respiratory signs in January 2019 and December 2020. The samples were also tested for other infectious upper respiratory viruses and bacteria, including influenza, herpesvirus, rhinitis viruses, andStreptococcus equi(strangles). They also tested 587 horses at Del Mar racetrack in California in the summer of 2020 and found one common equine pathogen in about one-third of the sick horses tested. However, none of the sick horses tested positive for COVID-19, but 6% of the healthy thoroughbreds tested positive for the virus. Another 1100 horses were presented to the teaching hospital at UC Davis and were tested. It was found that 3.5% tested positive for COVID-19, and it is believed the exposure was from humans with or without active COVID-19 infections. Dr. Pusterla also says the virus will likely become more contagious and could cause disease in horses in the future, so the disease will continue to be monitored in horses. Be sure to bring any questions or concerns you have about COVID-19 possibly infecting your horses to your veterinarian.

Category: Infection Is a Possible Complication of Tooth Extraction in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English As horses get older, dental disease becomes a problem, so all horses should have a dental exam performed by your veterinarian twice a year when vaccinations are due.  Lots of older horses will develop cupped out and shortened teeth, tooth fractures, and periodontal disease because feed becomes packed between the teeth and can lead to infection.  All of these cases will cause horses’ teeth to become loose or mobile in the mouth, which is painful and requires extraction.  Most dental extractions can be performed by your veterinarian with the horse sedated and a local anesthetic to numb the nerves.  However, some extractions will require general anesthesia. An interesting study was performed by veterinarians in Germany concerning the use of antibiotics after extracting teeth in horses.  In small animal medicine, it’s controversial if antibiotics should be used after extractions as many small animal dentists do not recommend them in dogs and cats after teeth are extracted.  The study in Germany involved 20 horses with various teeth extracted and blood samples were taken during and after the procedure.  It was found that as soon as one minute after an incision was made in the gum, many horses had bacteria in their blood stream and that these bacteria could lead to infections of the heart valves or pneumonia.  The study revealed 90 percent of the horses had bacteria cultured from their blood at some point during the procedure, and all extracted teeth were cultured and found to have bacterial infections.  For this reason, it may be wise for your veterinarian to place your horse on antibiotics after extracting a tooth to prevent infection from the mouth spreading to other parts of the horse’s body.

Category: Intestinal Parasite Egg Shedding in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many equine intestinal parasites are becoming resistant to current dewormers. Because of this resistance, most equine veterinarians are recommending fecal egg counts to determine the level of parasitism in each horse. By doing so, you can determine which horses require deworming and which are not as susceptible to parasites, and this will allow less deworming products to be used. The less dewormers that are used, the less resistance will develop. Unfortunately, we do not have any new classes of dewormers that are being developed so we have to control intestinal parasites as best we can with the products that are now available. In many cases, horse owners are still deworming their horses every 8 weeks, which was recommended 40 years ago, and is the reason we now have resistance developing. We know in a herd of horses that only about 20 percent of horses shed 80 percent of the parasites; because of this, only the 20 percent shedding parasites need to be dewormed more than twice a year. So the key is finding the horses that represent that 20 percent on your farm by having your veterinarian perform a fecal egg count. A recent study out of England indicated that adult horses generally have a consistent egg per gram count over a grazing season whether they’re treated with deworming medications or not. In younger horses, fecal egg counts were likely to vary more but in adult horses, the ones that were shedding low numbers of parasites continued to shed low numbers, and those shedding high numbers continued to shed high numbers. This indicates that in most cases of adult horses, the results of a fecal egg per gram count are consistent over time and these tests need to only be repeated frequently in young horses less than 5 years of age.

Category: Mosquito-Transmitted Disease Vaccines for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The numbers of mosquitos are sure to increase during rainy seasons or flooding, which also increases the chance of mosquito transmitted disease to your animals. The Texas Animal Health Commission sent out a press release recommending all horse owners contact their veterinarian and make sure their horses are up to date on equine encephalitis (sleeping sickness), and West Nile vaccines. There are three strains of sleeping sickness and all are transmitted by mosquitos. Eastern and Western encephalitis are more commonly found in the United States. In Texas, the Venezuelan strain has not been seen in many years but many vets still vaccinate for it due to our close contact with Mexico and Mexico has had outbreaks. All of these strains cause nervous system signs including loss of coordination, lethargy, depression. Some horses will not survive. Almost all of the horses with the Eastern strain will not survive while less than 50% usually die with the Western strain. West Nile virus causes similar nervous system signs and can also be fatal in some cases. So you can see how serious these diseases can be for your horse and it is important to make sure that your horse is currently protected. All of these mosquito-transmitted diseases can infect humans, so mosquito control is critical for people as there is no vaccine.

Category: Once Weekly Treatment to Prevent EPM In Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, or EPM, is a common neurological disease in horses. New research may have found a cost-effective method of preventing the disease. What Causes EPM? EPM is caused by the protozoal organismSarcocystis neurona. Young horses or those that are stressed by hauling or high-intensity exercise are more susceptible to the disease than other horses due to decreased immunity. Research on preventing this disease is difficult because not all horses exposed to the disease get sick. EPM Research Researchers have purposely fed horses this protozoal organism to try to cause disease, and it generally does not work. To evaluate the efficacy of preventing a disease, the prevention is administered to the animal, and then the animal is exposed to the disease. The animal is then observed or tested to see if they become ill. With EPM, the horse does not always become ill, so it is difficult to determine if a preventative therapy is effective. One method is to find the medication levels in the blood and compare that to the known amount of drug needed to inhibit the infective organism. A Potential New Treatment A study was performed recently with a product containing diclazuril. The Food and Drug Administration approves diclazuril for the treatment of EPM. The study found that giving healthy horses diclazuril only once a week at the labeled dosage was 130 times higher than the level needed to inhibit the organism. Because of this finding, giving diclazuril once a week could prevent EPM infection. However, a more extensive study will be needed to determine if this once-weekly dosage prevents the disease. If you have concerns or questions, consult your veterinarian about other treatments for the neurological disease EPM.

Category: Parasite Resistance in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Intestinal parasites can be a major problem in horses and hopefully all of you with horses are working with your vet to set up an effective deworming program. However, there is a major problem at this point in that many parasites are becoming resistant to the dewormers that are available. In the past, parasites called large strongyles were the major problems in horses but these seem to be effectively controlled. The small strongyles are a different story as many of these parasites have become resistant to a major class of dewormers called benzimidazoles. An example of this class of dewormer is fenbendazole that is sold under the trade name Panacur or Safeguard. A recent study indicated that the use of only Safeguard on a herd of horses for just 18 months led to resistance of the small strongyles to the drug. And the parasites in young horses were more resistant than those in older horses. So rotation of dewormers may be most effective. This is nothing new as most people usually rotate between deworming products. However, the question is when to rotate and will this be effective in parasites that are resistant? To determine if rotation was effective, the same horses that were resistant to safeguard were dewormed every 90 days with a rotation of ivermectin, Strongid, a high dose of Safeguard, and Quest. Results indicated that by rotating the dewormers, all of the wormers were effective, even safeguard that was previously resistant in this group of horses. Instead of just buying dewormers at the feed store, consult with your vet for their recommendations on controlling parasites in your horses.

Category: Pastern Dermatitis in Horses Caused by Mites
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pastern dermatitis is a fairly common condition, especially in draft horses and other horses with feathers on their legs. This condition is caused by many factors, including allergies, but one cause is a skin mite that causes inflammation and leads to infection. The mite can be found on many farm animals so other animals can be a source. One treatment thought to be effective was using a dewormer like ivermectin or Quest. To test this theory, Quest was used in a group of horses known to be infected with mites; Quest was chosen because it is in the tissue longer than ivermectin. All horses were treated orally on day zero and again on day 21. The stalls were cleaned and disinfected on day zero and again on day 14. They also used a placebo group that was not treated with Quest but the stalls were cleaned. Results indicated that the group of horses treated with Quest still had just as many mites on the legs as those not treated at all. So if you have a horse with pastern dermatitis caused by mites on the legs, treating with Quest and ivermectin are unlikely to be helpful. Although owners do not like the horse's feathers clipped, this is critical in most cases to kill the mites by using lime sulfur dip or frontline spray topically on the legs. Most of these horses also need to be on systemic antibiotics as well as topical antibiotics, and topical steroids to reduce the inflammation. Pastern dermatitis is a serious condition that can cause scarring and chronic infection on the legs that can lead to chronic pain and lameness.

Category: Pigeon Fever in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pigeon fever is a disease of horses that was originally seen in California over 100 years ago, and then it began spreading to other western states.  A survey in 2012 indicated the disease has occurred in all areas of the U.S. and that the highest number of cases was in Texas with a couple of cases reported in Mexico.  The disease is caused by the bacteriumCorynebacterium pseudotuberculosisand it is not known why the number of cases is increasing, although I have seen the disease for 25 years in central Texas and the number of cases is definitely increasing. This bacterium also affects sheep and goats but it is a different strain than the one that causes disease in horses. It is generally believed that the environment is a factor in survival of the organism as dry soil with fecal contamination promotes survival of the bacteria in the soil.  Also, insect populations are believed to be a major transmitter of the organism, especially house flies, horn flies and stable flies.  The disease is characterized by external abscesses in the pectoral region that cause a large amount of swelling. The swelling resembles a pigeon’s breast.  Also, infection can develop on the horse’s ventral abdomen, and internal abscesses, can also be seen, which are much more difficult to treat.  The external abscesses should not be treated with antibiotics but allowed to mature, and then lanced and drained by your vet.  The internal abscesses can be diagnosed with blood testing and ultrasound and require long-term antibiotic therapy.  The same organism can also cause ulcerative lymphangitis on the horse’s lower legs and antibiotics are required to treat this condition.  If your horse develops a swelling in the pectoral region, call your vet as pigeon fever may be the problem.

Category: Pinworms in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pinworms occur in horses, sheep and goats and even humans but the equine pinworm fortunately does not transmit to other animals or humans as different species of worm are involved. And although many dog owners commonly believe pinworms may be causing their dogs to scoot on the ground, dogs do not get pinworms. Pinworms are an unusual parasite as they are one of the only parasites in which the eggs cause disease. The adult female equine pinworm crawls out of the horse's rectum and lays eggs on the skin around the horse's tail. The eggs and surrounding fluid are irritating to that skin and causes the horse to itch, which is why horses with pinworms have hair loss around their tails. The eggs dry and then fall off into the environment, develop into larvae and are able to reinfect horses by being ingested. Diagnosis of pinworms is difficult as a routine fecal exam by your vet may or not find the parasite eggs because the eggs are not in the feces but are attached to the horse's skin. It is usually more effective to find the eggs by placing a piece of cellophane tape on the horse's skin around the tail and examining it under the microscope. As far as treatment of pinworms, most of the routine deworming products are somewhat effective and I say somewhat as no dewormers are 100% effective against pinworms. Another helpful treatment is to bathe the horse's tail area every third day as this will remove any eggs before they become infectious and will decrease environmental contamination. So if you have a horse that is rubbing its tail area, pinworms could be involved. Check with your vet about treating these parasites and preventing infection.

Category: Piroplasmosis and How to Protect your Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Piroplasmosis is a blood-borne parasitic disease that affects all equines and usually causes fever, anemia, yellowing of the membranes of the eyes and mouth, and urine that is tinged dark brown to red.  The disease is unusual in that some horses can die while others never even get sick.  However, the ones that never get sick are still carriers and can be a source of infection to other horses.  Because of this, horses that test positive must be quarantined or euthanized to prevent spread to other horses. Piroplasmosis is spread by anything that transfers blood from one horse to another and ticks are the most common method of transmission.  However, the disease can also be transmitted by using the same needle on different horses when giving injectable medication.  Even dental equipment like teeth floats can transmit the disease if not cleaned and disinfected well between horses as could tattoo or surgical instruments.   To protect your horse, the USDA has developed some recommendations to help protect your horse from piroplasmosis.  Always use a new sterile needle and syringe for injections whether the injection is in the vein or muscle.  And never use anything but a sterile needle and syringe to draw medication out of a multidose vial.  Always disinfect all equipment used on a horse after a procedure, including teeth floats and other dental equipment, tattoo instruments, and surgical instruments.

Category: Piroplasmosis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today I am going to talk about a rare disease in horses called piroplasmosis; it is also called babesiosis. The reason I am even mentioning this disease is that several horses in Florida were recently diagnosed with the disease so it is possible we could see it in horses in Texas, especially since the horses in Florida were imported from Mexico. The disease is caused by the organism Babesia, which is a protozoan parasite that affects red blood cells. In DVM Magazine, Dr. Donald Knowles indicates symptoms of the disease include fever, malaise, and anemia. Malaise is really a human term that means a general feeling of body discomfort, so in equine terms it describes a horse that just looks like he doesn't feel very well. Anemia is a decrease in red blood cells, which is caused by the parasite destroying the cells. Once infected, some horses may remain carriers for life even if they do not show any symptoms. The protozoans are transmitted by ticks but also can be transmitted from horse to horse by using the same needle for giving injections. This was the mode of transmission in some of the recent Florida cases. The United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, England and Ireland will not allow horses that are positive for piroplasmosis on the blood test to enter, but not all the tests are 100%. Although there is a drug to treat these horses, it is rare to completely clear the infection. Even though recovered horses are clinically normal, they are able to transmit the disease to other horses either through ticks or needles. This is just one reason to control ticks on your horses and to always use a new, sterile needle when giving an injection.

Category: Potomac Horse Fever Sometimes Fatal
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Potomac horse fever is a disease of horses that was first diagnosed in horses along the Potomac River in Maryland about 20 years ago. Since that time, Dr. Jon Madigan from the University of California at Davis indicates the disease has been proven to cause disease in 14 states, including Texas, as well as other countries. Because the disease was initially believed to be transmitted by ticks it was classified as anEhrlichiaorganism. Now it is known that the intermediate hosts of the disease are various species of fresh water snails and other water insects, and the name of the infectious organism was changed toneorickettsia risticii. Since fresh water snails and water insects are common around rivers and creeks, most infected horses are exposed while grazing in these areas. Potomac horse fever causes acute onset of depression, decreased appetite, and fever in horses as well as diarrhea, decreased intestinal signs, and mild colic. As with other similar diseases in horses, dehydration can be a real problem and some of these horses can also founder. The disease is deadly in 5 to 30% of the cases and has also been shown to cause abortion. Diagnosis of the organism requires isolation of the organism from the blood or feces as serological tests for this disease are unreliable. Potomac horse fever is treated with intravenous tetracycline and this treatment has been shown to be somewhat effective. Although a vaccine is available for prevention of the disease, it has not been shown to be effective in many cases. Although this disease is not commonly seen in Texas, it has to be considered in any case of diarrhea and depression with fever.

Category: Preventing Contagious Diseases in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Last program I talked about preventing contagious equine diseases from spreading at boarding stables and horse farms by quarantining all new horses for 3 weeks.  Of course it is also important to make sure all horses have a current Coggins test before being allowed to enter the premises.  Another concern is strangles.  Strangles is a serious upper respiratory tract disease that is caused by the bacteria strep equi and is highly contagious.  The difficulty with strangles is that some horses can be chronic carriers and shed the organism while not showing any clinical signs; a horse could enter a stable and appear completely normal and yet be contagious.  Because of this, it is recommended to test all new arrivals for strangles.  Strangles testing is sort of involved as it requires flushing fluid up into the nasal cavity and collecting it for culture and another test called a PCR.  If a horse is determined to be a shedder, it must be isolated until they are no longer shedding.  Carrier horses can maintain the organism in two pouches in the back of their throats called guttural pouches.  Treating these pouches with penicillin can kill the organism and prevent the horse from being contagious.  Although this is a lot of trouble, it should be considered when a new horse is entering an established herd to prevent strangles infection. Influenza is another contagious disease but is a virus and because the incubation period is very short, the 3-week quarantine period for new horses recommended on our last program will catch any influenza-infected horses to prevent exposure to the entire herd.  Join us on our next program when we will continue to discuss methods of preventing contagious equine diseases.

Category: Protozoal Myeloencephalitis (EPM) in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) is the most common neurological infectious disease of horses in North America, but it's difficult to diagnose. The disease is caused by two different protozoal parasites called Sarcocystis and Neospora, which affect the nervous system. Symptoms include progressive and asymmetrical incoordination, muscle wasting, and gait abnormalities. The asymmetrical aspect is an important part as it is typical that one side of the horse or one leg is more affected than the other side. There are multiple tests available for EPM but all of them only indicate exposure to the parasites; they do not indicate the cause of the symptoms due to the disease. Different labs promote their blood tests as the best, and different vets have confidence in different blood tests. A recent study involving over 5,000 horses in 18 states revealed that 78 percent of the horses tested were positive for Sarcocystis and 34 percent were positive for Neospora while 31 percent were positive for both parasites. However, none of these horses had any symptoms of EPM and were normal. It is important to realize that only less than 1 percent of the horses that are found to be positive on blood tests are actually going to show symptoms of the disease. EPM may be the most overdiagnosed disease in America because it has so many varied symptoms and testing is so inaccurate. Testing spinal fluid does increase the accuracy but there can be problems with this test as well as difficulty in obtaining the sample. So if you think your horse might have EPM, just realize that 78 percent of horses that do not have EPM are positive on the blood test, and that even if your horse is positive, it does not indicate your horse has EPM.

Category: Pythiosis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on the program I am going to talk about an uncommon skin infection in horses called pythiosis, or phycomycosis, that does occur in Texas.  Dr. Susan White from the University of Georgia indicates these are not true fungi but are actually plant pathogens that cause disease in horses.  Most of the time, this occurs when horses have small cuts or scrapes on the skin and they become infected standing in stagnant water or wet grass.  The disease is most commonly found in the Gulf Coast states and most lesions are on the horse’s legs or under the belly. After infection, the lesions quickly enlarge and drain pus and bloody fluid. They are nasty lesions.  Because they can look like other infections, it is important for your vet to take a piece of the tissue to get an accurate diagnosis.  One unusual characteristic is these lesions contain little hard calcified masses called kunkers.  Unfortunately, these cases are difficult and some horses have to be euthanized if the lesions are too advanced to treat.  If the lesions are found early, they can be removed surgically but many times the lesion will recur.  Antifungal medications are not effective since these organisms are not true fungi.  There is a vaccine produced by Pan American Veterinary Labs in Hutto, Texas, that has shown good success in early cases of pythiosis and even some response in chronic cases. If your horse has a rapidly growing skin lesion that is not responding to normal wound treatment, contact your vet as soon as possible because early cases of pythiosis have a much better prognosis than ongoing cases.

Category: Rabies in Animals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   Click here for a summary. Descriptions of rabies go back thousands of years as rabies has classically been one of the most feared infections of all time. It is because of this fear that dog ownership requires a license and documentation of rabies vaccination. There is still no reliably effective treatment for rabies infection once symptoms have started. The virus does not survive outside of the infected host very long, so direct contact with fresh secretions is required for transmission.  In most cases, the disease is transmitted via a bite wound and it is mostly wildlife that gets infected. When wildlife starts coming into contact with the pet population, then pets become infected and when pets get infected, human infection is not far behind. Because this infection has nearly 100% mortality, preventing it in pets becomes crucial to preventing it in people. Of course, people can get infected by wildlife contact as well. Despite vaccination being readily available, every year the U.S. reports approximately 50 canine deaths, 250 feline deaths, and several human deaths from rabies. Worldwide, some 55,000 human deaths occur annually from rabies even now in the 21st century. The most common wildlife species to spread rabies to domestic animals and humans in the Northern Hemisphere are skunks, bats, raccoons, foxes, and coyotes. Wildlife (especially bats) can gain access to indoor areas where they can come in close contact with both pets and people. Indoor pets are not without risk. Many people do not realize how fast death occurs from rabies. While it may take a long time for the virus to incubate, once even mild symptoms begin, death occurs within 10 days. The injection treatment most people have heard of only works during the incubation period;once symptoms have started, survival chances are slim. The Course of the Disease The virus in the infected animal's saliva enters the victim's tissues during the bite. The virus attaches to the local muscle cells for a couple of days before penetrating local nerves and beginning its slow ascent to the brain. Once within nervous tissue, the virus is not accessible to the immune system and may safely proceed toward the brain. The journey is slow and can take up to a year but the average time is three to eight weeks depending on the species. Virus ultimately reaches the brain and in two to three days more is evident in all body secretions, including saliva. At this point, the disease becomes transmissible and symptoms begin. It can take up to a year from the time of the initial bite before symptoms begin to show.In dogs, typical incubation periods are 21-80 days.In cats, it's 28-42 days.Once symptoms show, treatment is nearly impossible. Prodromal Stage (The First 2-3 Days After Symptoms Have Started)A personality change is noted. Friendly animals become shy, etc. The larynx begins to spasm and a voice change may be noted (especially true in rabid cattle). Most infected animals will actively lick or scratch the site of the original bite. Excitative Stage (Next 1-7 Days) Classically, this would be the "mad dog" stage, though, in reality, most animals skip this phase altogether. The animal has no fear and suffers from hallucinations. If confined, the animal often attacks the bars of the cage. Paralytic or Dumb Stage (Next 2-4 Days) Weakness/paralysis sets in. The larynx is paralyzed, resulting in an inability to swallow, thus drooling and "foaming at the mouth" result. The animal dies when the intercostal muscles that control breathing are paralyzed. It is from animals in this stage where most human exposure occurs. There is no treatment for animals or humans once clinical signs appear. Once the virus has been released to body secretions, it is again accessible to the immune system; however, the patient dies before an adequate immune response is mounted. The classical symptoms of rabies described above may not be recognizable, making diagnosis difficult if not impossible in a living animal. Long quarantines are often needed to determine if the infection has occurred. When human exposure to the animal in question is involved, what happens depends on several criteria. If the animal in question is dead, its brain can be tested for rabies. There is no test for rabies in a living animal but since we know that death follows quickly after the virus becomes contagious, a living animal can be confined for 10 days. If the animal is still alive 10 days after biting a person, then the bite could not have transmitted rabies.  Prevention For Our Pets Happily, rabies prevention is accomplished with vaccination and limiting exposure to wildlife. The standard killed virus vaccines are available for both dogs and cats and, after the initial dose which is good for one year, subsequent doses are generally good for three years. Because tumors have developed in cats who received the killed virus vaccine, a recombinant product is now available that uses a portion of rabies viral DNA cloned into a harmless canarypox virus. This arrangement allows the pet to realize the benefits of live virus vaccination without any risk of exposure to the living rabies virus. Rabies vaccination protocols are typically controlled by municipal regulations. Most communities legally require the vaccination of all dogs. TheAmerican Association of Feline Practitionersrecommends rabies vaccination as a core vaccine for all pet cats. For pets not current on rabies vaccination that have been exposed to biting wildlife, the Texas Post-Exposure Rabies Prophylaxis Protocol has been particularly helpful. In this situation, the pet should be vaccinated for rabies as soon as possible after the wildlife bite with booster vaccines given three weeks post-bite and eight weeks post-bite. The pet should be strictly isolated for 90 days. This protocol has been extremely successful in preventing rabies symptoms and contagion when normal rabies vaccination had lapsed. Treatment for Humans (Post Exposure Prophylaxis or PEP) As mentioned, once symptoms have started, treatment can be attempted but truly there is little chance of survival. The only way to survive rabies is to exploit the long incubation period and basically get vaccinated quickly. Doing this involves a very big piece of information: knowing you were (or may have been) exposed. Every year a small number of people die of rabies in the U.S. Most of these people were bitten by a dog, bat, or some other animal and did nothing other than basic first aid. Recall that it takes many weeks for the rabies virus to reach the brain. This allows time for the vaccine to be given so that when the virus "comes out" of its neurologic hiding place and is ready to infect the brain, a substantial immunologic response is waiting. The virus is foiled and clinical rabies does not result. If you are bitten by an animal and its rabies vaccination history is unknown, there are definite steps to take. A fresh bite wound should be washed out with water quickly as this may wash out viral particles. The time it takes for the virus to reach the brain depends on the amount of virus and how close the wound is to the head. This simple step can be life-saving. If the biting animal is alive, its vaccination status should be confirmed as soon as possible and it will need to be confined according to local law. The bite wound should be reported to the health department as soon as possible. Only rodent and rabbit bites are not reportable. If the animal is dead then its brain can be tested for rabies. The head of the biting animal is submitted to the health department for fluorescent antibody testing for the rabies virus. This process takes a matter of hours so that any bite victims can know right away if they will require rabies treatment. If the animal is not available or its vaccination status is in question, further treatment may be needed. Hyperimmune (antibody-rich) serum is flushed into the wound in the hope of inactivating the virus before it penetrates the nerves. The patient receives a vaccination on a regular schedule for about a month, as described above. Veterinarians have a rabies exposure risk of more than 300 times that of the general population. Anyone pursuing a career with animals should consider vaccination against rabies. The Law Regarding Animal Bites (Against Humans) In the U.S., states and counties have different regulations regarding rabies vaccines for companion animals and bites to humans. Regulations for your area in the U.S. can be found through your county's health department. In almost all states in the U.S., the biting animal must be confinedfor observationfor 10 days at the owner's expense regardless of vaccination status. The purpose of the quarantine period is to determine if the rabies virus could have been in the animal's saliva at the time of the bite. An animal infected with rabies and shedding virus will certainly be dead within ten days. If the biting animal is known to have been exposed to wildlife, the situation is different. A vaccinated animal must be re-vaccinated within the time period required by local regulations and confined for observation for the specified duration. Unvaccinated animals may be confined for a specified time period according to local/regional law, or be euthanized and tested for rabies. In the U.S., all bites to humans that break the skin are reportable to local health departments. Rabies vaccination requirements vary from state to state, and country to country.  Contact your veterinarian if you think your pet has come into contact with or been bitten by a wild animal. Regardless of the vaccination status of your pet, wild animal bites may lead to painful wounds and infection. Again, laws regarding biting dogs and rabies vaccination are highly regional.Check with your local animal regulation department, your veterinarian, or visitrabiesaware.orgto find out what you need to know in the U.S.. Quarantines when Traveling Great Britain, Hawaii, Japan, New Zealand, and several other island areas have successfully eradicated rabies from their territory. These places are EXTREMELY cautious about allowing in potential carriers of rabies. Because of the long incubation period of rabies, a very long quarantine is needed; however, this must be balanced by the expense associated with quarantine and owners' reluctance to be separated from their pets. Most places that have eradicated rabies have protocols for avoiding or minimizing quarantine. Typically, a microchip is implanted in the pet for identification purposes, a rabies antibody titer (a measurement of vaccine-induced protection) must be performed at an approved laboratory, and rabies vaccine documentation is necessary. For listings of what each state requires for entry, go to theUSDA. Fortravel to another countrycheck with that country's consulate, but guidelines are also available at USDA. Other Links TheCDC's rabies home pagehas, in addition to basic information, a children's education area that is particularly helpful for families who go camping. The annualWorld Rabies Daycalls attention to this problem to raise awareness and provides information about rabies in both humans and animals.  In Summary: You can’t treat rabies once symptoms set in; all you can do is prevent it. Rabies is a virus transmitted through saliva or brain tissue. Without rapid preventive treatment, it is almostalwaysfatal. That’s why your pets are required to have rabies vaccines in many areas of the world. The most common wildlife species to spread rabies to animals and people in the Northern Hemisphere are bats, skunks, raccoons, foxes, and coyotes. It is generally caused by a bite wound, and mostly wildlife gets infected. Rabies affects a mammal’s central nervous system. It can take up to a year before symptoms begin to show, but the average time is 3-8 weeks depending on the species. In dogs, the typical incubation period is 21-80 days. In cats, it's 28-42 days.Once symptoms begin, treatment is nearly impossible. If you are bitten, you need a preventive injection immediately as it only works during the incubation period. Once even mild symptoms begin, death occurs within 10 days.  After symptoms have started:  Symptoms may not be obviously recognizable, making diagnosis difficult if not impossible. There is no diagnostic test for rabies in a living animal. What happens after people are exposed depends on the situation. If the animal is dead, its head is sent to a laboratory so the brain tissue can be tested. In some circumstances/locations, a living animal can be quarantined for 10 days at the owner’s expense; if the animal is still alive, then the bite could not have transmitted rabies. The vaccine protocols are typically controlled by municipal regulations. Most communities legally require all dogs to be vaccinated and recommend it for cats. Vaccination requirements vary from state to state, and country to country. Exposed pets not current on rabies vaccination should be given booster vaccines at 3 and 8 weeks post-bite. The pet should be strictly isolated for 90 days. Exposed humans should wash the bite with water as it may wash out some virus particles; the time it takes for the virus to reach the brain depends on the amount of virus in addition to how close the wound is to the head.  This step could save a life. Animal bites need to be reported to local health departments. Veterinarians have a rabies exposure risk of more than 300 times that of the general population. Anyone in an animal-oriented job should consider preventive vaccination.Back to top The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Rhodococcus equi in Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In spring, we have to start thinking about diseases that can affect foals. Today on the program I am going to talk about pneumonia in foals caused byRhodococcus equi.Rhodococcusis a bacterial organism that lives inside cells in secretions of the respiratory tract of foals and causes a severe pneumonia with abscesses in a foal's lungs. Most affected foals are between 1 and 6 months of age. The unusual fact aboutRhodococcusis that it is commonly found in the feces of grazing animals and at most horse farms. Some of theRhodococcusorganisms are capable of causing disease and some are not, and both are usually found at most farms. Most foals become infected withRhodococcusby inhaling the organisms; the more organisms that are in the air, the greater chance of infection. To decrease the number of inhaled organisms, one thing you can do is to avoid keeping foals in dry dusty areas. It is much better to keep foals in larger areas covered with grass than small paddocks. Also, it has been shown that watering down small paddocks before bringing in foals can decrease the number of airborne organisms. It is recommended to avoid keeping large groups of foals together as it has been shown thatRhodococcuscan be contagious between foals, so the larger number of foals that are together increases the dust and chance of exposure. Infected foals should be isolated because infected foals have high numbers of disease, causingRhodococcusin their respiratory tract. Any foals found breathing hard and lethargic should be examined by your vet immediately.

Category: Rhodococcus Pneumonia Uncommon in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pneumonia is not a common disease in horses but there are several predisposing factors that can cause pneumonia to develop. Dr. Harold McKenzie from Virginia indicates most pneumonias develop secondary to upper respiratory viral infections such as influenza and herpes virus, and this is one reason to vaccinate your horse for these diseases. Transporting horses long distances is also a risk factor for pneumonia if the horses are not allowed to lower their heads in the trailer. Tying their heads up for long periods decreases clearance of bacteria organisms so if horses are hauled long distances, they should be taken out of the trailer every 3 hours at least to allow them to lower their heads. If possible, not tying their heads at all is better. Horses that undergo anesthesia are also susceptible to pneumonia as are those that have recovered from an episode of choke. A more severe form of pneumonia can also develop if the infection escapes the lung and enters the space outside the lung; this is called pleuropneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia is based on finding coughing, labored breathing, fever, abnormal breath sounds and wheezing. Examining cells from the lungs and culturing lung fluid is helpful in making the diagnosis and determining correct treatment. Ultrasound of the chest is helpful to check for lung abscesses or fluid outside the lung in the case of pleuropneumonia. Certainly exercise restriction is required as are long-term antibiotics. Horses that are having a really difficult time breathing may respond to bronchodilators and some horses may need non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain and inflammation. These cases are difficult to treat so consult your vet before starting antibiotics if you feel your horse may have pneumonia.

Category: Ringworm in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Probably the most common skin disease seen in horses in Texas other than fly allergies is ringworm. Ringworm is not a worm at all but actually a fungus. We see ringworm year round in Texas and the most common symptom is raised patches of hair and then the hair falls out leaving scaly skin. In our practice, ringworm is more common on the horse's face and neck and can spread to other areas without treatment. The best method to diagnose ringworm is for your vet to culture some of the infected hairs because other conditions such as fly allergies and immune conditions can have the same appearance. It is important to know what you are treating because treatments for allergies and immune conditions will cause ringworm to worsen so an accurate diagnosis is needed. Ringworm is common in young and immunosuppressed horses due to their lack of immunity. Also, ringworm can be a secondary infection that can develop at the site of damaged skin related to minor injuries or fly bites. The disease can be contagious between horses by using the same saddle blankets and halters so these items must be sterilized and not used on any other horses until the infection is cleared. The most effective treatment of ringworm in horses in my experience is bathing followed by a rinse using chlorhexidine. Treatment is usually continued for 30 days or until cultures are negative. It is reported that ringworm is self-limiting in horses and will clear up after several months without treatment. However, a lot of skin damage due to scratching can occur during this period of time so treatment is recommended. Treatment also helps to prevent transmission to other animals.

Category: Severe Skin Infection of the Horse’s Legs Called Cellulitis
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It can be certainly be frightening if you come out one day and see one of your horse’s legs swollen to two to three times the normal size, and clearly having pain and lameness. Possibilities include a leg fracture or another musculoskeletal injury, so call your vet to examine the horse. However, another possibility is a skin infection called cellulitis and in some cases, it is unknown how the infection develops. Dr. Margaret Mudge with Ohio State indicates in Equus magazine that the bacteria may already be in the tissue or could be introduced through the skin by punctures that are unable to be found. Or the condition can occur when bacteria are introduced through a wound or surgical incision. Multiple types of bacteria can be involved, so usually your vet will take a sample to attempt to identify the bacterial organism causing the problem. Commonly these infections affect the back legs and if not treated aggressively, the infection can enter deeper structures like joint and tendon sheaths, and can be deadly. Also, if the horse cannot stand on the affected leg, laminitis or founder can occur in the other rear leg as it is supporting all of the horse’s weight. Treatment includes intravenous antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and cold hosing to help remove the swelling. Once the horse has less pain, exercise is the most helpful treatment to reduce swelling but wrapping can also be used to prevent further swelling. The major concern with this infection is if it damages the tissue and affects the lymph system’s ability to draw out fluid and return it to circulation. If this occurs, the leg will always be larger than normal and will be susceptible to infection with any minor break in the skin. If your horse’s leg is even moderately swollen, don’t wait but call your veterinarian right away.

Category: Strangles Infections in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most of you with horses have probably heard of strangles, a highly contagious upper respiratory tract infection. The disease is caused by a strep bacteria and is transmitted from horse to horse by nasal shedding or discharge from draining abscesses. Dr. John Timoney from the University of Kentucky indicates in Equine Disease Quarterly that nasal shedding of the bacteria begins 4 to 16 days after infection and continues for 2 to 3 weeks in most horses. However, some horses may remain carriers of the organism for months or even years, shedding the organism to other horses. To determine if the horse is a carrier, three nasal flushes should be performed and the fluid removed is cultured to determine if there are live organisms. There is a test called a PCR test that looks for DNA of the strep bacteria and is very sensitive. However, the PCR test will be positive even if the bacteria are dead so if the PCR test is negative, you can be fairly certain the horse is not a carrier. However, if it is positive, it does not indicate if there are any live bacteria and the horse is a carrier because you can have false positives. Another method determining if a horse has strangles, particularly if the infection is deep inside, is a blood test called a strep antibody titer. A few rare horses can develop abscesses inside the abdomen or chest, and this blood test is one method of diagnosis. Fortunately, these cases are generally not contagious to other horses as the bacteria is not being shed. Strangles is a highly contagious disease. Talk to your veterinarian about vaccinating for strangles. If one of your horses develops the disease, it is important to follow your veterinarian’s recommendation on preventing spread of the disease. Strangles is commonly found in horses less than 5 years old. The equine strep organism does not infect people and the human strep does not infect horses. The staff at Kansas State Diagnostic Laboratory  reported a case of strangles that came into the lab from a 4-month-old foal that was having difficulty breathing. The foal had severe swelling in lymph nodes around the throat. It was having such a difficult time breathing that a surgical opening was made in the skin of the neck and into the trachea to allow the foal to breathe. Because of the severity of the disease, the foal was euthanized. Afterwards, the foal was found to have severe swelling of all lymph nodes in the back of the throat and the guttural pouches were filled with infection. Because strangles is a highly contagious disease, the rest of the herd was quarantined so no horses entered or left, and the quarantine lasted for 30 days after the last horse had no symptoms of strangles. Multiple horses in the herd developed strangles and after the last case resolved on the farm, thorough disinfection was used. There are several things to be learned from this case. First, always quarantine any new horses you bring into your herd for three weeks. Second, if you are concerned with strangles, test any new horses before placing them in the herd and vaccinate all horses with intranasal vaccine. And because horses with previous exposure can react to vaccine, blood testing can be used to identify horses that may react to it.

Category: Strep Immune-Mediated Myopathies in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Strangles is a common upper respiratory tract infection in young horses. Most of the time strangles is a mild disease.  Strangles is caused by the bacteriumstrep equiand usually causes nasal discharge, fever, and swollen lymph nodes, especially under the throat.  However, complications can develop after strangles infection. An unusual complication of strangles is muscle damage that can occur at the same time as the upper respiratory infection or just afterwards.  These horses develop a stiff gait and muscles over the back and hips become painful.  This disease is extremely severe as most of these horses will be unable to rise after just a few days due to the severe muscle damage, and they may need to be euthanized.  It is believed this syndrome is related to toxic shock syndrome in people, which is also caused by a strep bacterium. These horses can be treated with penicillin, anti-inflammatories for pain, cortisone, and fluids, but most do not recover.  Another complication of strangles is an immune-related disease called purpura hemorrhagica.  After horses recovers from strangles, they may develop stiff and painful muscles in this syndrome but they also may colic.  Colic in horses has multiple causes but in this instance it is related to the horse’s reaction to the bacterium that decreases blood supply to the intestine.  Another muscle disease related to strangles can also cause muscle atrophy.  Muscle atrophy is a loss of muscle mass and when it’s related to strangles, the muscle loss develops over a very short period of time.  If your horse develops painful swollen muscles, colics, or loses a large amount of muscle quickly after an upper respiratory infection, contact your vet immediately The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Thrush in Horse’s Hooves
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Thrush in horses is a fairly common problem especially at the time of year when horses stand around in wet muddy areas.  Although standing in water or mud does not cause the disease, I think it decreases the integrity of the sole and frog to fight off infection and enable infection to enter the tissues easier than it would if the horse was on a hot dry summer pasture.  Dr. Steve O’Grady says thrush is a degenerative condition of the frog caused by a bacterial infection, which leads to deterioration of the frog and a black necrotic type of discharge with a foul odor.  If the infection is severe, it can infect the sensitive tissues of the foot causing pain and lameness. Almost all cases of thrush are caused by incorrect trimming of the frog and sole that allow deep sulci (the clefts on either side of and in the middle of the frog) to develop. Some will have one deep central sulcus of the frog extending to the hairline at the heel.  Although there are many products available to treat thrush, none of these products will be effective until the foot is trimmed correctly.  If the frog is recessed and the hoof wall is too long, allowing a deep sulcus to develop, no treatment is going to be effective without appropriate foot trimming.  The frog should be in contact with the ground when the horse bears weight on the foot.  Horses that are not trimmed often enough in whom the hoof wall has grown too long, or those with shoes that raise the frog above the ground, can develop contracted heels; this allows thrush to develop. So, if your horse develops thrush, make sure the horse is trimmed correctly and do not expect any treatment to be effective until the foot is correctly trimmed.  In general, the hoof wall at the heel should be on the same plane as the frog for the foot to function properly.

Category: Treating Equine Parasites with Fenbendazole
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Treating equine parasites is more difficult these days due to many parasites being resistant to various dewormers.  The most common parasite in adult horses at this point is the small strongyle.  The most common parasite in foals is the roundworm.  A study was recently performed by the staff at Kansas State to determine the amount of resistance of these parasites to the dewormer fenbendazole that is sold under the trade names of Panacur and Safeguard.  And yes, that is the same fenbendazole that some are using for cancer treatment in humans.  Fecal samples were taken to check the number of parasite eggs before deworming.  After deworming, a second fecal egg count showed an average strongyle egg reduction of 71.8%.  However, this average varied widely between farms, with some locations experiencing only 40% reduction while others had a total elimination of strongyle eggs following deworming. Fenbendazole was more effective in treating foals with roundworms as the reduction of eggs after deworming was over 98 percent.  So fenbendazole is effective at treating most roundworms in foals but its effectiveness at treating small strongyles in adult horses, even at a double dose for five days in a row, is questionable.  For this reason, it is important to have your veterinarian check your horse’s feces for parasite eggs before and after deworming.  You could be using a product that is ineffective, which costs you money and can affect the health of your horses.  Certainly giving a one-time dose of fenbendazole to an adult horse for small strongyles is likely to be ineffective as these horses were given a double dose for five days with only a moderate response.

Category: Viral Arteritis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine viral arteritis, or EVA, is a contagious disease of horses caused by a virus. Although not deadly, it can cause abortion in pregnant mares, death in young foals, and can become a persistent carrier in stallions. And although Standardbreds and warmbloods are the most common horses affected, we did have a quarter horse outbreak in six states in 2006 that concerned horse breeders. Transmission commonly occurs through direct contact with horses spreading the virus in their respiratory tract, but venereal transmission is a major concern on breeding farms as the virus can even be spread through chilled or frozen semen. Clinical signs of EVA infection include fever, depression, decreased appetite, swelling of the lower legs, scrotum and mammary area, hives, inflammation around the eyes, and sometimes nasal discharge. If a pregnant mare is exposed close to term, she may not abort but may have an infected foal who may develop a serious case of pneumonia. Foals also infected within a few months after being born can develop a severe pneumonia or intestinal infection. Colts and stallions can become life-long carriers of the virus. There is an EVA vaccine for horses that is safe and effective. However, since the vaccine can cause horses to test positive for the virus and it is impossible to determine if the horse is positive from vaccine or infection, all horses should be tested before being vaccinated. There is a lot of technical aspects as far as timing of vaccination depending on age and use of the horse, so careful consideration should be used before vaccinating your horses for EVA. Discuss the issues with your veterinarian.

Translating Return to English Summer and fall are the most important times to have your horse protected against West Nile virus. Dr. Tammy Beckham from the Texas A&M Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory indicates the death rate among horses from West Nile is from 30-40 percent, and of those that recover, 40 percent may still exhibit some symptoms six months or more after recovering from it. Although West Nile is not in the news as much as it was in the past, the diagnostic lab indicates the percentage of horses they tested for West Nile that were positive has increased significantly over the past few years. The virus uses birds as hosts and mosquitoes to transmit the virus. West Nile is now considered to be endemic in the U.S., and transmission to humans and horses is possible. Clinical signs of West Nile include neurological signs such as depression, wobbling, weakness of the legs, lameness, partial paralysis, muscle twitching, and the inability to stand. There are many nervous system diseases that can cause similar symptoms so blood testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. The appropriate test is required because some tests are affected by vaccination and will provide a false positive due to vaccination. Prevention of West Nile infection centers around vaccination as it is difficult to keep mosquitoes off of your horse. Two vaccines are required initially within a 30-day period and then the vaccine is usually administered once or twice yearly, depending on the recommendation of your veterinarian and the horse’s chance of exposure. Using normal methods of decreasing mosquito population, such as eliminating standing water, will help decrease numbers of West Nile cases in both humans and horses.

Category: White Line Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have horses, you may be familiar with the term white line disease but may not know a lot about the condition. White line disease is really not a disease and the white line is actually not a structure but a space involving the junction of the hoof wall and the sole. But even though the name is not correct, we continue to refer to it as the white line and white line disease. The condition is characterized by separation of the hoof wall from the solar area and the tissue under the hoof wall. The area of separation under the hoof wall is open and many organisms have been incriminated in causing the disease. There are many products on the market that claim to cure white line disease by killing the infection. Unfortunately, none of these products will work without treating the real problem, which is instability of the hoof wall and separation. X-rays are required to determine the extent of the separation and then your veterinarian can resect or remove the damaged hoof wall because without hoof wall removal, the hoof will not heal. The affected hoof wall can be removed with a Dremel or cast cutter but it all must be removed back to normal tissue. Once the hoof wall is removed, almost any medication can be applied to help the hoof wall heal. To help stabilize it, the horse is required to wear a special shoe until the hoof wall grows out. I have had clients that bring in horses they have been treating with months for white line disease by using some of these topical products and the horse is still lame. These horses cannot be treated correctly without having your vet x-ray the foot and remove the affected hoof wall, so if you or your farrier believe your horse has white line disease, call your vet for x-rays of the area and treatment.

Category: Blood Testing for EPM in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English EPM, short for equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, is the most common neurological infectious disease of horses in North America. It is difficult to diagnose. The disease is caused by two different protozoal parasites, Sarcocystis and Neospora, which affect the nervous system. Symptoms include progressive and asymmetrical incoordination, muscle atrophy and gait abnormalities. The asymmetrical aspect is important as it is typical that one side of the horse or one leg is more affected than the other side. There are multiple tests available for EPM but all of them only indicate exposure to the parasites and do not indicate if the cause of the symptoms is due to the disease. Different labs promote their blood tests as the best, and different vets have confidence in different blood tests. A recent study involving over 5,000 horses in 18 states revealed that 78 percent of the horses tested were positive for Sarcocystis and 34 percent were positive for Neospora while 31 percent were positive for both parasites. However, none of these horses had any symptoms of EPM and were normal. It is important to realize that only less than one percent of horses found to be positive on blood test are actually going to show symptoms of the disease. EPM may be the most over diagnosed disease in America because it has so many varied symptoms and testing is so inaccurate. Testing spinal fluid does increase the test's accuracy, but there can be problems with this test as well as difficulty in obtaining the sample. So if you think your horse might have EPM just realize that 78 percent of horses that do not have EPM are positive on the blood test and even if your horse is positive, it does not mean your horse has EPM.

Category: Dummy Foals Have Nervous System Signs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dummy foals are also called neonatal encephalopathy and perinatal asphyxia syndrome. Dr. Pam Wilkins indicates in the Practitioner that there is a wide spectrum of clinical signs associated with dummy foal syndrome, including mild depression with loss of the suckle reflex, ranging up to severe signs including grand mal seizures. Most of these foals are normal at birth but usually start showing signs of nervous system disease within the first 24 hours. These foals can have abnormalities of other systems including gastrointestinal, kidneys, cardiovascular, respiratory and even endocrine systems. The cause of the syndrome is believed to be related to difficult birth or premature separation of the placenta at foaling, but some foals may have an unexplained decrease in oxygen even before foaling. These foals are quite difficult to treat on the farm and most of them really need to be in a hospital intensive care stall. Controlling seizures is critical as is supporting circulation and correcting metabolic abnormalities, and most of these therapies involve close monitoring of blood work and continual intravenous treatment. Some of these foals can develop fluid buildup (edema) in the brain, and treatment for that consists of medication to decrease brain swelling to avoid further damage. Some foals will require blood transfusions and for them fluid support is critical but you must be careful as giving too many fluids can lead to other problems. Some foals will require tube feeding or even intravenous feeding as without nutrition, many of these foals will become weak. If you have a foal that has any nervous system signs, the foal may be a dummy foal and most of those require immediate intensive care to survive.

Category: Hoof Abscess Treatment in a Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you go to the barn and discover that your horse will not bear weight on one leg, a hoof abscess may be the problem.  Dr. Steve O’Grady says in the Remuda publication that an abscess is an accumulation of pus underneath the sole or inside the hoof wall, and just a few drops of pus can be extremely painful to the horse.  There are many causes for acute severe lameness, but a hoof abscess is the most common.  Many clients call us thinking their horse has a broken leg or other severe injury that turns out to be a hoof abscess. Your horse should always be examined by your vet if there is any lameness.  Hoof pain can be diagnosed with hoof testers by applying pressure on the sole. If it’s positive, this tells the vet there is a problem in the hoof but does not tell us the cause.  Your vet will examine the foot closely for signs of a puncture or opening at the white line that could allow an abscess to develop.  If an apparent abscess is not found, sometimes x-rays are required to rule out other causes of lameness, and sometimes an abscess can be seen on the x-ray. Although punctures are certainly possible, most hoof abscesses develop from dirt or other material contaminated with bacteria that enters the area under the sole at the white line. Horses with founder or those that do not have their feet trimmed regularly have a widened white line that makes them susceptible to an abscess.  Treating these abscesses involves opening the area at the white line to allow drainage. Making an opening in the sole requires much longer to heal.  If your horse becomes acutely lame, an abscess may be the cause. Whatever the cause is, calling your vet is the best option.

Category: Neurological Diseases with Long Term Consequences in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are several neurological diseases in horses that can cause long term symptoms even after they seem to have recovered from the disease. West Nile Virus is a viral infection that crosses into the brain and spinal cord causing inflammation that can lead to signs resembling colic, lameness, a decrease in appetite, and fever.  It can cause severe disease in some horses, leading to inability to stand, paralysis of the facial muscles and the tongue, behavioral changes, seizures, and even death.  Dr. Stacy Oke says that most horses with West Nile infection recover in a few weeks, but about 10% of the infected horses continue to have some neurological deficits that can affect their ability to walk and perform. Some can also have residual behavioral abnormalities. Eastern Equine Encephalitis is another disease that affects the neurological system and is even more serious than West Nile Virus.  Symptoms of Eastern Equine Encephalitis are similar to West Nile Virus including fever, depression and behavioral changes, circling and head pressing, muscle twitching and paralysis of the cranial nerves, and seizure. Death occurs in 50-90% of cases.  Dr. Maureen Long says most horses that do survive Eastern Equine Encephalitis have long term neurological dysfunction.  Vaccines are available for both West Nile Virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis and are very effective in most horses.  Both diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes, and both can be transmitted to humans as well as horses, although Eastern Equine Encephalitis is fairly rare in humans.  The diseases are not transmitted directly from horses to people.

Category: Neurological Problems in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. David Ramey is a veterinarian in Los Angeles, and in an article in Veterinary Practice News he talks about the three most common neurological diseases in horses. Most everyone with a horse has heard of a disease that affects the horse's nervous system that is transmitted by opossums; some people even call it 'that opossum disease.' Although the protozoal organism that causes the disease is transmitted in opossum feces, the opossum itself does not cause the disease. The correct name of the disease is equine protozoal myelitis, or EPM for short, and it is the most commonly diagnosed and misdiagnosed neurological disease in horses. Lots of horses are diagnosed with EPM that probably do not have the disease because of the difficulty in making a diagnosis. Symptoms of EPM include typical nervous system signs such as wobbling when walking and atrophy of muscles, but many other signs can also occur. Another neurological disease called wobbler is a syndrome in which the vertebrae in the neck narrow, thus pinching off the horse's spinal cord. It causes similar symptoms to EPM. The third nervous system disease that is a real concern is infection with herpes virus 1 because it is contagious to other horses. Usually these horses initially become weak and paralyzed in their back legs and then the disease progresses. This disease tends to affect horses at shows; I suspect that's due to stress, and because it's contagious, it can cause a lot of horses to be quarantined. Two nervous system diseases of concern in Texas that Dr. Ramey did not mention are rabies and West Nile virus infection. Any nervous system disease in a horse is serious and your veterinarian should be called as soon as symptoms are noted.

Category: Respiratory vs. Nervous System Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most serious infectious diseases we see in horses is the neurological form of the herpes virus. It can affect the respiratory tract and generally causes mild disease. But when it affects the neurological system it can be deadly. Researchers at Michigan State found that young horses generally develop respiratory disease, while older horses usually develop the neurological form of the disease because of different immune responses. At the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) convention, researchers said that 10% of horses develop the neurological form of the disease. It is unclear why some horses develop this form and not others. Some predisposing factors in horses that develop the neurological form include increasing age, female sex, pregnancy, or nursing. Certain breeds seem more susceptible including standardbreds, warmbloods, thoroughbreds, quarter horses, paints, appaloosas, Spanish horses, fjords, draft horses, and the Lipizzaner. According to the publication The Horse, the first infection begins in the respiratory tract, and the virus is picked up by the lymph nodes where it enters the bloodstream. This is when the neurological form occurs. The virus attacks the blood vessels resulting in vasculitis, in which white blood cells infiltrate the area, developing blood clots that cause tissue destruction. In the study, the young horses that developed only the respiratory disease had two different temperature spikes while the horses that developed neurological disease only showed the secondary fever spike. Horses that developed either the respiratory form of the disease or the neurological form had classic responses consistent with the form of disease they had developed. Scientists are looking to alter the immune response to decrease the neurological form of the disease.

Category: Sacroiliac Pain in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Back pain in horses has always been and still is a difficult diagnosis. Many horses are diagnosed incorrectly with it and treated by chiropractors and acupuncturists and even veterinarians even though the horse probably doesn't even have back pain. Lots of horses get injections in their backs because back pain is difficult to prove. Certainly horses can have back pain but determining for sure which ones do and which ones don't is difficult. And the very low back, or sacroiliac joint, is also difficult to diagnose as a cause of pain. To correctly diagnose the condition, your vet will have to numb or block the joints and then see if the horse is clinically improved. However Dr. Rob Nan Wessum indicated at a recent AAEP meeting that there are several gaits that suggest sacroiliac joint disease. Many horses with sacroiliac disease will track narrow when at a walk or a trot: To avoid rotating the sacrum, the horse places the hind feet closer together than normal when walking, and it appears the horse is walking on a line with each hind foot landing in front of the other. Also, some horses with sacral pain will walk with both limbs advancing at the same time while normally the walk is a four-beat gait and all limbs move at different times. This is especially evident when you walk the horse in a serpentine or zig zag pattern. Another key for sacral pain is when the horse is trotting in a circle, the hind limbs do not follow the front limb and are either in a wider or narrower path. Many of these horses will also hold their tail to the same side when walking and will also bunny hop or move both back legs together when cantering. If your horse has any of these characteristics, ask your vet about sacroiliac pain.

Category: Sleep Disorders in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Sleep is important to our health and it is just as important to our horses' health, so today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about normal sleep patterns and sleep disorders in horses. A paper presented at last year's AAEP convention indicated that horses require far less sleep than humans as horses average only about 3 to 5 hours of sleep per day, although foals sleep more than adults. Horses have intermittent periods of sleep during the day but most of their sleep happens at night, especially if they are in a stall. REM is a stage of sleep that allows horses to get the most benefit from sleeping because it is the deepest sleep, but horses only devote about 30 minutes per day to REM sleep and most of REM sleep occurs when horses are lying down. Sleep disorders can cause some serious problems for horses and the most common sleep disorder is sleep deprivation. There are many reasons for sleep deprivation, such as being in a new environment and being afraid to sleep or to lie down. Horses on the show circuit may not sleep well because of activity in the show barns all night, and hospitalized horses may not sleep because of all the activity. Also, horses may not sleep because they are in pain and may not want to lie down because they are concerned they can't get back up. Horses affected by sleep deprivation appear sleepy during the day and may even collapse. Some of these horses will have unexplained abrasions on their knees and fetlocks from collapsing when they fall asleep; while many folks believe these horses have narcolepsy, that condition is rare in horses but occurs more commonly in miniature horse foals.

Category: Nasal Discharge in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the more common phone calls we receive concerns a horse having a nasal discharge. These can be insignificant or very significant depending on the amount and type of discharge. Probably the most serious discharge is a hemorrhage out of the nose, although most of these are not an emergency as most are an exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage is usually noted after an event that requires all-out performance and the hemorrhage noted at the nose is usually very small drops of blood. However, one condition resulting in a severe nose bleed can be deadly, and this bleeding occurs due to a fungal infection in the back of the horse's nasal cavity. The fungal infection damages a major blood vessel in the area and causes it to rupture. If this vessel ruptures, the bleeding can be so severe it can lead to death. If a large amount of blood is noted from the nasal cavity, emergency surgery is usually required and the horse needs to go to a surgical facility immediately. Trauma, such as the horse running into a wall or falling and landing on the head, can also cause bleeding but usually these bleeds are limited and there is little chance of losing a significant amount of blood.Another cause of nasal bleeding is a mass called a progressive ethmoidal hematoma and these masses usually cause intermittent bleeding from one nostril only. The other cause of nasal bleeding is a hematoma in the sinus cavity and many of these require surgery. The other significant type of nasal discharge is a purulent discharge. A purulent discharge is yellow or green pus and usually indicates an infectious process. Some of these infections are just upper respiratory infections in the nasal cavity and will respond well to antibiotics. However, many of these infections are located in either the guttural pouches or the sinus cavities. If your horse has a discharge that does not respond to antibiotics, it is critical for your vet to place a scope in the nasal cavity and upper airway to determine the source of the discharge. The guttural pouch is a structure unique to horses and is a small pouch with an opening just in front of the horse's throat. This structure can become infected and is a common site of infection in horses with strangles. The difficulty with infections in this pouch is that oral or injectable antibiotics are rarely effective, and in many cases the infection must be flushed out with a catheter. The other source of a chronic nasal discharge is a sinus infection and like a guttural pouch infection, flushing out the sinus is usually required. The difficulty in this procedure is that to flush the sinus, a hole must be made in the bone of the face to insert a tube for flushing or a surgery must be performed to remove a flap of bone to examine the sinus. Sinus infections can be a primary infection or they can commonly occur as a result of dental disease. An infection in the mouth around the teeth can enter the sinus, so any horse with a sinus infection must have a thorough dental exam to determine if dental disease is the source of the infection. If you have a horse that has consistent bleeding out of the nose, even if it is a small amount, be sure and call your veterinarian as an endoscopic exam is required to determine its source.

Category: Sinus Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Nasal discharge is not an uncommon finding in horses, and most of the time it is due to an infection somewhere in the respiratory system.  However, if the nasal discharge does not respond to treatment with antibiotics and continues for a period of time, it is possible the infection could be in one of the sinus cavities, especially if the discharge is from only one nostril.  And even though the sinuses are also part of the respiratory system, sinus disease can be a difficult problem to diagnose and treat. Sinus infection can develop secondary to a bacterial infection of the respiratory tract and although antibiotics can decrease the drainage, it generally will not resolve the problem.  In most cases, the sinus must be opened surgically and flushed with sterile fluid to cure the infection. Sinus infections can also occur because of tooth root infections.  The roots of the cheek teeth in the back of the horse’s mouth are directly adjacent to the sinus cavities, and infection of these teeth can cause the sinus to become infected.  In most cases to treat the infection it is necessary to remove the infected tooth, which can require general anesthesia and opening the sinus.  There are also masses that can develop in the nasal cavity called ethmoidal hematomas that can affect the sinus, as can cancerous masses.  Another cause of nasal discharge from a sinus is a sinus cyst, a cystic structure that produces a large amount of fluid in the sinus but is not infected.  Treatment of a sinus cyst involves removing a piece of bone over the sinus and dissecting out the cyst.  If you have a horse who has a nasal discharge for a long period of time, a sinus problem is the most likely source.

Category: Blood Builders in Performance Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The equine industry is overrun with supplements. Some of the most common supplements are those that claim to increase the amount of red blood cells as this theoretically will increase oxygen to the cells and therefore increase the horse's speed. Dr. Ed Kane reports in DVM 360 that blood builders, or hematinics, usually include nutrients such as iron, copper, B12, thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, and recombinant human erythropoietin. These products are reported to increase red blood cell production and hemoglobin in an effort to boost aerobic capacity in exercising horses but there is little evidence of their efficacy and safety. The major component of many of these products is iron although iron is well regulated by the body and a deficiency would be rare in horses. If there is no deficiency, supplemental iron is unlikely to be effective at increasing the number of red blood cells, and products containing iron have shown no benefit. Giving a horse products such as human erythropoietin that actually do increase red blood cell production is unethical, potentially dangerous to the horse's health, and can cause serious side effects especially when used with other drugs. Although the erythropoietin increased red blood cell mass, there was also an increase in blood viscosity (thickening of the blood). The researchers studying the drug were concerned about getting the blood too thick, which is especially a concern on horses taking furosemide to prevent lung bleeding while running. Many people check a resting blood sample on a horse and want the red blood cell count to be higher. However, the horse maintains about 30% of its blood in the spleen, and it is released with exercise so a resting blood sample is not really indicative of the horse's actual number of red blood cells.

Category: Carbohydrate Concentrations Affected by Grass Height for Grazing Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the major problems we see in horses and other equines is laminitis, and this is mostly due to eating pasture grass with a high concentration of carbohydrates. The intake of non-structural carbohydrates increases the glucose level in the blood, and this causes an increase in insulin. That increase causes laminitis, so many of these horses have to be taken off pasture. However, it is also not a good idea to stall these horses and so you have to turn them out in a dry lot, and many people do not have the facilities to do that. The researchers at North Carolina State studied the effects of mowing the grass and the effect that would have on insulin and glucose levels. The pasture used for the study consisted of tall fescue, and the tall height of the plants were 12 inches and about 6 inches tall after mowing. All horses used in the study were healthy with no evidence of equine metabolic syndrome, and horses were interchanged weekly on different pastures. Results indicated that horses did eat less when the grass was shorter, but they still ate enough to get the amount of forage needed for their requirements. Some horses did lose weight on the mowed pasture. However, we have to be careful looking at this study because although the carbohydrate intake was less in the mowed pasture, that doesn't mean it would be low enough to prevent laminitis in an insulin-resistant horse. Also, remember that this study was done using only fescue. If you have an insulin-resistant horse, this study doesn't mean you can just mow the pasture and turn your horse out because the horse could still develop laminitis from the shorter grass.

Category: Cobalt Use Has No Known Benefit for Performance Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It appears the newest fad to give to racehorses to supposedly increase their performance is cobalt. Dr. Teresa Burns from Colorado State indicates in the Horse magazine that cobalt is a trace mineral found in B vitamins that horses require in their body but only in tiny amounts. Although trainers are supplementing horses with cobalt, no one really knows how much cobalt is needed to affect the horse’s body. One study examined five mares supplemented with various doses of cobalt. After being given the compound by IV, some of the horses became anxious, had a rapid heartbeat, had increased blood pressure, and had heart arrythmias. The authors concluded that administering cobalt intravenously to horses has a significant effect on the cardiovascular system that could result in large vessel ruptures, bleeding, severe injury, or death. There is no known benefit to giving intravenous cobalt to horses in this manner and the increased blood pressure could lead to organ damage in the horse and even human injury. The heart arrhythmia that was noted has been associated with a high risk of acute death. Dr. Burns indicates we really have no idea what ongoing cobalt administration does in horses as no studies have been performed. We don’t know if there really is a performance benefit, although we haven’t seen one yet, and what long term problems it could cause. However, cobalt has been shown to be fairly toxic in humans and rodents, causing various nerve and hormonal disorders. She indicates that research is being performed on cobalt in horses but she feels it has the potential to be quite harmful and should not be used in horses until research is completed.

Category: Dehydration and Electrolyte Loss in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English After a ride you may notice your horse sweating, because that is the number one method horses use to keep cool. The longer the ride and the hotter the weather, the more sweat is lost. Sweat is made up of water and electrolytes, and some German researchers described various patterns and estimated sweat loss with each one. Sweat loss is reported in liters, and a liter is about the same as a quart. The researchers report that if the area under the saddle and throat are wet and there are small white areas at the corners of the saddle, four to seven liters of sweat has been lost. If there is foam on the bridle and noseband, the flanks are wet, and the area under the saddle and girth are wet, then the horse has lost seven to nine liters. If the throat and flanks are wet, the area above the eyes is moist and has dark wrinkles and foaming between the limbs, nine to 12 liters has been lost. If the horse is actually dripping fluid above the eyes and under the belly, it is estimated 12-18 liters water has been lost, which is three to four gallons of water loss. So you can see water loss, particularly in hot weather is a major concern, and electrolytes are lost at the same time. Dehydration is a major issue and you need to know how to determine if your horse is dehydrated. With dehydration, the skin becomes less elastic, so the best way to start is with a skin elasticity test. If the horse is mildly dehydrated, when you grasp the skin on the horse's shoulder and pull it up in a tent shape, the skin will remain tented for two seconds. With severe dehydration, the skin will tent for four to five seconds. Another method to check for dehydration is to check capillary refill time. Simply lift your horse's lip and the gum tissue should be pink and moist. If it is tacky and your finger temporarily sticks to the gum, the horse is dehydrated. Press on the gum with your finger and the pink color should return in at least two seconds, as longer indicates dehydration or decreased circulation. If your horse is dehydrated, not only is water needed but electrolytes are too; the most important electrolytes are sodium, chloride, and potassium. If your horse is already dehydrated, your vet can give your horse oral fluids with a nasogastric tube and can add electrolytes to the mixture. If the dehydration is more severe, intravenous fluids with electrolytes may also be required. It is better to prevent dehydration and electrolyte deficits than to treat it. This involves making sure your horse is given electrolytes in the feed, especially before exercise in hot weather. Make sure the electrolyte you choose contains a large amount of sodium chloride. In hot weather, I recommend to many of my clients that they add an ounce of table salt and an ounce of lite salt to their horse's feed twice a day.

Category: Diet’s Effect on Horse Behavior
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A recent study indicated that diet can have an effect on your horse’s behavior. A graduate student at Virginia Tech performed a study on the horses in the university’s riding program.  The study involved using different levels of fat and starch and determining behavior.  The Horse publication indicates that in the study 20 riding horses were split into five groups of four horses. Each group received a different starch-to-fat ratio in their diet ranging from 7.1% to 14.3% starch.  All horses were fed twice daily for the 21-day duration of the study, housed in individual stalls and ridden in the university’s riding program, which consisted of beginner to advanced equitation (riding) and hunter/jumper.  All riders and instructors were blinded to the diet so they did not know which horses were being fed which diets.  The horse’s behavior was evaluated while being caught, led and groomed as well as while being ridden.  Reaction to leg aids, relaxation and submission were also noted. Blood samples were taken before and after the 21-day trial. Results indicated that the different diets had no significant effect on the horse’s body weight or condition score, and this was expected as all diets were balanced for body weight and body condition score.  However, horses on high-starch low-fat diets had higher behavior reactivity scores from both instructors and riders.  Horses on low-starch diets became better behaved over time and those on high-starch diets were less well behaved.  You may have always heard that high-grain diets make horses hotter and more difficult to handle, and although most nutritionists say this is not the case, this study seems to indicate that horses on high-starch diets are more difficult to handle as these diets have a negative effect on behavior.

Category: Feeding to Prevent Colic in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Colic is one of the most dreaded conditions we see in horses and one of the most common.  Dr. Anthony Blikslager from North Carolina indicates in The Horse magazine that horses are more prone to digestive upset than other domestic animals because of how their digestive tract functions and how we feed them.  The manner in which we feed them is the critical part as horses evolved as grazing animals free to roam on large pastures and eat a small amount of grass off and on during the day.  Now we take horses and confine them and feed them twice a day and give large quantities of concentrates, both of which are contrary to their evolution.  Most horses colic because of the feeding and stabling practices that we subject them to. To decrease the chance of colic, consider feeding your horse in a manner more natural to their evolution.  When at all possible, turn your horse out in pasture as it has been shown horses at pasture colic less than those kept in stalls.  I know some of you do not have turnout areas and the most important thing you can do in this case is to feed a small amount of hay throughout the day, or have hay available throughout the day.  Horses colic more when eating concentrates or grain because many times the grain is not absorbed in the small intestine and moves into the large intestine.  Grain in the large intestine causes the bacterial population in the gut to change to digest the starch and this creates gas.  In some cases, the bacteria can produce toxins and lead to enterotoxaemia.  Since horses cannot get rid of the gas by burping as cattle do, the gas builds up and causes pain.  If you have to feed a large quantity of grain per day, feed small amounts frequently to avoid gastrointestinal upset.

Category: High Potassium Levels in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Potassium is an electrolyte that is necessary for multiple body functions as well as other actions. If the potassium level in the blood gets too high major complications can occur, and if high enough it can be deadly. The kidney filters excessive potassium that is excreted in the urine, but if the kidneys are failing less potassium is excreted. Also, most of the potassium in the body is inside the cells but certain conditions can cause potassium to leave the cell and be in the circulation, which can increase the potassium in the blood stream and cause problems. High potassium can lead to increased muscular contraction resulting in cramping, and also can have severe effects on the heart. The staff at Kentucky Equine Research indicates that clinical signs noted with a high potassium level include muscle weakness, trembling, depression, lethargy and a change in the heart rhythm, specifically a very slow heart rate. Some horses are more susceptible to increased potassium levels and these are horses with HYPP or hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. HYPP is a genetic muscle disease that was first recognized in quarter horse studs and it is believed 4 percent of the quarter horses are currently affected. Most of these horses show symptoms before 3 years of age. While some horses just have muscle twitching, others may have severe muscle cramping, staggering; some horses will go down and be unable to rise. Some horses can have paralyzed respiratory muscles as well as the muscles in the throat, and those will not survive. Treating increased potassium levels, regardless of the reason, is by using intravenous calcium to protect the heart and intravenous glucose to lower the potassium level.

Category: Is Your Horse Predisposed to Insulin-Related Laminitis?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have horses, you have heard about laminitis but may not know if your horse is susceptible. Insulin-related laminitis is the most common cause of laminitis and is due to increased levels of insulin, usually due to your horse’s diet and body condition. Laminitis is a painful foot condition, and a large portion of treatment and prevention is related to the horse’s diet. Horses with hyperinsulinemia-related laminitis have high levels of insulin in the blood and carry excessive fat tissue. Prof. Simon Bailey, BVMS, DipECVPT Ph.D., FRCVS, says in the publicationThe Horsethat these abnormalities are known as equine metabolic syndrome, and hyperinsulinemia-related laminitis is part of this syndrome. Hyperinsulinemia means there is a higher level of insulin in your horse’s blood than is healthy. There are several factors that make your horse susceptible to this type of laminitis, including genetics. Some horses are more susceptible depending on their breeding. Ponies and overweight horses are more likely to develop laminitis than other horses. Obesity may be due to feeding too much feed, but in many cases, obesity is due to insulin resistance, and once a horse is overweight, obesity further increases insulin resistance. If your horse is overweight or only has fat pockets in certain areas, they are susceptible to developing laminitis. One study showed that 50% of the light-breed horses in the United States were obese. There is a clear association between insulin dysregulation (this means an abnormal regulation of a metabolic process) and pony breeds, Spanish and gaited horse breeds, miniature horses, and warmbloods. Some of the horse breeds studied are more metabolically efficient than others. Evolution could play a role as the ancestors of these breeds adapted to a harsh environment coming out of Western Europe after the last ice age. This is why these breeds cannot adapt to the lush pastures and the high carbohydrate feeds of today.

Category: Nutritional Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Horses, aka Big Head Disease
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A fairly rare nutritional disease in horses is nicknamed big head disease. The actual name is nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, so the reason it is referred to as big head disease is because one of the major clinical signs is that the head bones grow toobig. This enlargement occurs because the horse's feed has an improper calcium to phosphorus ratio causing high phosphorus levels in the horse's blood. This enlargement occurs due to a diet low in calcium and either high in phosphorus or low in vitamin D. Also, some grasses like Dallis grass, buffel grass, panic grass and Setaria contain high levels of oxalates, and these grasses decrease absorption of calcium. High phosphorus in the blood triggers a release of hormones that causes calcium and phosphorus to be resorbed from the bone. As calcium is absorbed from the bone, it is replaced by fibrous tissue that exceeds the amount of bone resorbed. Since the bones of the skull are affected, the head enlarges and causes the big head appearance. In some cases, the head enlarges so much that horses cannot eat and their teeth loosen and fall out. Early signs also involve a shifting leg lameness due to weakened bones that can lead to fracture. Treatment involves changing the feed to one with a correct calcium to phosphorus ratio. Alfalfa is a good choice as it has a high calcium level. You can also add limestone to the alfalfa to increase the amount of calcium. It will usually take up to a year for these horses to improve, if they survive. So it is important to realize nutrition is important and feeding a balanced diet is critical for all animals. For this reason, the calcium to phosphorus ratio of all supplements you are giving your horse should be reviewed as some supplements could lead to problems.

Category: Acupuncture for Axial Stiffness in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Acupuncture has been promoted in horses for years, and a new study indicates it may be effective. The Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association published a study in September 2023 concerning the short-term effects of acupuncture on steeplechase horses exhibiting axial stiffness. The axial skeleton contains the skull, vertebral column, sternum, and ribs. Axial stiffness is basically a decrease in the ability to rotate around the spine, and this study used 12 horses with axial stiffness during training. Six horses were randomly assigned to an acupuncture group, and the other six horses were not treated and were used as negative controls. Through the use of a questionnaire, each horse’s locomotion was evaluated by their rider and trainer before treatment and again at seven and 14 days after. Additionally, the improvement of the horse’s dorsal flexibility two days after treatment was evaluated individually at the trot. Expert clinicians assessed free jumping at the canter, and free jumping at the trot was objectively evaluated via internal measurement units. Results showed more horses in the acupuncture group improved on days seven and 14 compared to the non-treated control group. Subjective evaluation of the dorsal (back) flexibility also showed a significant improvement for horses receiving acupuncture treatment compared with the control horses that did not receive treatment. The authors of the study determined acupuncture may be an interesting non-drug therapy to improve clinical signs of axial stiffness and performance in steeplechase racehorses. More studies involving acupuncture and other nonstandard treatments in horses are needed, and one concern with this study is the low number of horses involved. When a smaller sample size than the ideal is used, the chance of assuming that a false conclusion is true increases.

Category: Aquatic Therapy for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Osteoarthritis is the most common musculoskeletal problem in horses and is a common cause of decreased performance. There are many treatments of arthritis for horses but physical rehabilitation is a fairly new therapy for them. One of the commonly used physical rehabilitation treatments in humans is aquatic therapy; it has been shown that it not only helps healing of the affected limb but also the entire body. Aquatic treadmills have been effective in people to treat injuries as well as aiding in cardiovascular health. Several aquatic therapy studies in dogs have shown significant improvements in range of motion in the painful leg as well as the opposite legs. Also, dogs that had surgery for a cruciate ligament rupture in the stifle recovered more quickly with aquatic therapy compared to dogs rehabilitated without water therapy. As far as horses, there have been some studies that have shown the cardiovascular benefits of aquatic therapy in them with an increase in muscle intensity compared to rehab that doesn’t involve water. There are lots of rehab centers that are using water therapy for horses but the science involving the use is mostly coming from studies in humans and dogs. For this reason, although it is assumed aquatic therapy will be helpful in healing of equine injuries like it does in dogs and humans, there is little scientific data to support this. The problem is that without scientific studies, it is not known how deep the water should be, how long therapy should be continued for different conditions, and how frequently it should be used to maximize effectiveness. Hopefully in the next few years, scientific studies will be performed concerning aquatic therapy in horses because until then, there are a lot of unknowns about the various aquatic treatments being used in horses.

Category: Are your Horse’s Feet Being Trimmed Correctly?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English I know that most of you do not trim your horse’s feet and that most farriers do a good job of trimming.  However, I still see very long toes in some horses that have recently been trimmed, and that can lead to all kinds of problems.  After your farrier trims your horse’s feet next time, pick up the front feet and look at the bottom.  If there is a large space greater than 1/8 of an inch between the hoof wall and the sole at the toe, it is likely the hoof wall at the toe was not trimmed short enough.  Also, on the front feet, the foot should be about as wide as it is long and this should be measured.  Use a tape measure and measure from the widest part of the foot across the sole and then measure from the heel to the toe.  On a front foot, these measurements should be pretty close to the same.  The toe should at least be no longer than ¼ inch when compared to the width.  And if you look at the dorsal hoof wall after the trim and the hoof wall is dished and curved toward the toe, the toe is too long. Long toes predispose horses to toe cracks. I see horses come in commonly with toe cracks and the cause in many cases is just that the toes are simply too long.  Also, the wide white line at the toe is the major cause of hoof abscesses because this gives dirt and bacteria a place to enter the hoof.  A long toe delays breakover and places more stress on the navicular bone, which can predispose some horses to navicular syndrome.  And finally, a long toe can be detrimental in foundered horses as it increases pull by the deep digital flexor tendon on the coffin bone.  Horses that have foundered commonly have long toes.  So after your horses are trimmed next time, pick up their front feet and make sure the toes are trimmed correctly.

Category: Arthritis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Arthritis is a common problem in performance and older horses.  Dr. Stacey Oke says in The Horse magazine that arthritis simply means joint inflammation. It is also called osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease.  Classic signs include heat, swelling, lameness, stiffness, and in severe cases enlargement and grinding of the affected joints.  Although any joint can be affected in horses, the most commonly involved are knees, fetlocks, hocks and stifles as these are the highest motion joints.  If your horse is lame you may feel arthritis is the cause, but this cannot be determined without x-rays as there are other conditions that can have similar signs, and in the early stages signs of arthritis may not be found on x-rays. There are three types of arthritic pain. One is nociceptive pain, which is caused by activating pain receptors in the joint.  Inflammatory pain can also occur due to inflammatory mediators being released in and around the joint, which also prime the nociceptive pain receptors to be more sensitive.  Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to areas of the nervous system that perceive pain. These differences are important. As Dr. Sheila Laverty from Quebec indicates, we have to control all three types of pain to treat arthritis.  One treatment is weight loss. If your horse is overweight, weight loss may decrease the amount of pain medication needed.  Joint injections can be used if a few joints are involved, but those are not without risk.  Thousands of joint supplements are available and most have no proof of effectiveness, so check with your veterinarian about the most effective supplements in their experience.  Anti-inflammatories are also useful but unfortunately, there is no current cure for arthritis in animals or people.

Category: Arthritis in the Neck Can Cause Equine Lameness
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Lameness in horses can be difficult to diagnose.  Sometimes, the lameness is so subtle that it is only felt by the rider and when lameness is that subtle, nerve blocks to numb the potential affected area are not helpful.  Also, it is possible the lameness in a leg is not because of a leg problem at all, but the problem is in the neck.  Arthritis in the neck and associated nerve impairment can cause lameness in horses that usually appears in the forelegs but can be severe enough to affect the gait of the rear legs as well if the intervertebral joint is involved and the spinal cord is compressed.  Dr. Gwenola Touzot-Jourde is an anesthesiologist in France and she mentions that sometimes you cannot find a problem in the limbs because the problem is not in there but in the neck. She says that arthritis commonly occurs at the junction of the C6 and C7 vertebrae at the lower neck, and nerve compression is also common in this area.  This vertebrae in this area have two articular process joints on either side of the vertebrae as well as the intervertebral joint.  This area receives a lot of rotational movement and stress in ridden horses, and can compress the seventh cervical nerve that is associated with shoulder and foreleg sensation.  This specific syndrome is different from spinal cord compression, which can lead to hind limb weakness that can also occur in the neck.  The researchers examined the compression of the seventh cervical nerve by anesthetizing the nerve in normal horses and found these horses had shortened gaits and general lack of shoulder tone.  However, there was no stumbling or falling, which was expected.  So if your horse is off on the forelimbs and your veterinarian cannot find a problem in the leg, the neck could be the source of the problem.

Category: Back or Neck Pain in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses can develop back or neck pain and these conditions are difficult to diagnose and treat. Neck and back pain are not uncommon in performance horses. Dr. Robin Dabareiner, DVM, said at the Western Veterinary Conference that the horse’s neck has more than 100 muscles and seven very large vertebrae. Neck pain is common in horses that turn quickly, such as cutting horses, barrel horses, and eventers. Horses can develop back pain from hock arthritis, as they move in a way that causes strain on the back. Some affected horses are unwilling to flex their neck and they may have a crabby attitude. Others may work well in one direction but not the other. There is debate on the conditions causing equine back pain and how to treat it. Horses can have arthritis in the back, strained muscles, and inflammation of the ligaments between vertebrae. Overriding dorsal spinous, a condition known as “kissing spines” (when the dorsal spines of the vertebrae rub together and cause pain), can be another cause of pain. Symptoms of horses with back pain include kicking or bucking under saddle, resisting bending side to side, poor quality cantering, poor jumping technique, cross cantering, and objecting to being saddled. Treatment of neck and back pain includes anti-inflammatory medications given orally or injected into the affected joints, injecting ligaments between the vertebrae, or mesotherapy (injecting small amounts of steroids, and local anesthetics under the skin at affected areas). Shock wave therapy in addition to acupuncture is used in some instances. Some horses with kissing spines respond to surgical removal of the portion of the spinous process involved.

Category: Back Pain in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Back pain in horses has always been a difficult diagnosis because it is hard to get any objective data on the horse’s back. However, Dr. Cooper Williams said at the AAEP Convention that equine practitioners should be using ultrasound to further examine the muscles in the horse's back. Almost all equine practitioners have access to an ultrasound with sufficient power to image the equine back muscles and can diagnose specific conditions in this area. The multifidus muscle is the major muscle in the horse’s back. It is not a single muscle, but a group of overlapping muscles grouped into five distinct bands. Each muscle originates at the end of a spinal vertebrae and spans two to four vertebrae and it is likely that injuries to these muscles are underdiagnosed. Because these muscles are deep and adjacent to the vertebrae, examining them by palpation, X-rays and even bone scanning is not very effective. Many of these horses have atrophy of the back muscles and spasms and these muscles can be examined thoroughly with ultrasound. All of the muscles in the back should be examined with ultrasound. It requires measuring the size of the muscles and comparing results to the same muscles on the other side to know if there is a problem, so this procedure does require some time and experience. Changes noted on ultrasound may be the size and shape of the muscles, a decrease in shade of the image, which can indicate a tear in the muscle or injury, and an increase in muscle shade that can indicate inflammation where the muscles are attached to the bone. So, if you have a horse with a suspected back problem causing decreased performance, ask your veterinarian about an ultrasound exam.

Category: Bandaging Horse's Legs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses commonly develop lower leg wounds and some of these wounds are difficult to heal as proud flesh is a major inhibitor of healing in equine wounds.  Proud flesh is actually correctly called exuberant or excessive granulation tissue.  Granulation tissue is needed to fill in the defect of the wound if it is not sutured.  However, in horses, the granulation tissue does not stop growing once the wound defect is filled but keeps growing out of the wound and prevents healing. The question today is about understanding when to bandage lower leg wounds in horses or leave them open to air out.  And the answer is it depends on a lot of factors, one of which is your geographic location.  Although not reported in the literature, it seems we have a lot more problems with proud flesh in Texas and other warm climates than in colder climates.  I don’t know if this is due to temperature, flying insect irritation or humidity but many wounds are left open in colder climates while most of ours in Texas require a bandage, at least initially, with medication to retard growth of proud flesh.  Some scientific studies indicate that bandaging decreases oxygen supply to the wound and increases proud flesh, and this may be correct unless you use medication to control it.  However, in my experience, it is difficult to control proud flesh in Texas if you leave the wound open.  If proud flesh does develop, the best treatment is to have your vet remove it surgically as medications to remove proud flesh damage surrounding tissue and further delay healing.  I think wrapping all lower leg wounds in horses is initially a good idea and then allow your vet to examine the wound, and further bandaging recommendations depends on the area of the wound and its healing status.

Category: Barefoot Versus Shod Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Shoeing your horse versus allowing the horse to go barefoot is a controversial topic, and I will say up front that there are many different and very strong opinions on this subject. Some folks firmly believe that no horse should ever have shoes, while others believe shoes are ok. Dr. Steve O'Grady from Virginia indicates that the equine foot with healthy structures is superior in its natural or barefoot state as opposed to the shod state with regards to the weight of the horse, shock absorption, and dissipating the energy of impact. Shoes are applied for a number of reasons including protection: when wear on the ground surface exceeds growth at the coronet, increasing traction or as a therapeutic aid in the treatment of lameness. There are some aspects of leaving a horse barefoot that should be considered for a horse competing in less rigorous events, and pleasure horses may do fine without shoes assuming the horses is given time to adjust to being barefoot. D. O'Grady indicates he has had success in improving the hoof capsule in the heel of the hoof in some horses by leaving them barefoot for a period of time. It is important to realize that a horse shoe is not an extension of the horse's foot as it changes the properties of the hoof-ground interaction. Without a shoe, there is one interface between the ground and the hoof, and with a shoe there are two interfaces: one between the hoof and the shoe, and then between the shoe and the ground. Also, a shoe elevates the hoof off of the ground, resulting in less heel expansion. There are some horses that need to be shod and some that can go barefoot and you cannot make a blanket statement that all horses need shoes or all horses do not need shoes. All horses are different.

Category: Capped Elbow Treatment Difficult in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have ever seen a horse with a large, movable swelling at the point of the elbow, it is likely a capped elbow. It's also called a shoe boil, although it does occur in barefoot horses. These swellings are filled with fluid and occur due to trauma from the heel of the foot hitting the back of the elbow when the horse lies down. The trauma of the heel causes a bursa or fluid-filled sac to develop at the back of the elbow, and a similar condition can occur at the point of the hock called a capped hock or the front of the knee. In fact, the same condition can occur in dogs at the elbow but is called ahygromaand is due to lying on hard ground. Treatment of this condition is very difficult as draining the swelling with a needle will remove the fluid, but because a membrane is producing the fluid, it will generally recur. Also, sticking a needle in the swelling must be done with a sterile technique or the bursa will get infected and then the problem will be worse. Some veterinarians have opened the bursas and used drains to allow drainage while others have opened them and cauterized the tissue with strong iodine to prevent recurrence. The bursas can be removed surgically but it is difficult to keep the sutures in because if the horse lies down, the pressure on the suture line causes the sutures to come out. So after surgery, horses have to be tied up for at least three weeks to prevent the sutures from pulling out. One method to prevent the bursa from enlarging is to place a doughnut-shaped object called a shoe boil roll on the horse's pastern to prevent the heel from touching the elbow as the horse lies down. If your horse develops a small swelling at the point of the elbow, call your vet so treatment can be considered while the swelling is still small.

Category: Coffin Bone Tumor in a Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An unusual tumor occurs in the bone inside the horse’s hoof, called a coffin bone. It’s called a keratoma. It is a benign tumor that develops from the inner hoof wall and is located between the hoof wall and the bone, and obviously there is not much space in that area.  Consequently, the tumor causes pain, lameness and damage to the bone.  Although these tumors are commonly seen in the toe region, keratomas can occur in the quarter, heel or sole and can even be above the coronary band.  As these keratomas grow, they can distort the hoof wall and cause a bulge on it.  However, just because you do not see a bulge does not mean a keratoma cannot be involved.  Usually there is a slowly progressive lameness, and separation of the white line by the keratoma can allow infection to enter the hoof; the problem can be misdiagnosed as a simple hoof abscess.  The sole will usually be positive to hoof testers similar to an abscess. However, if you treat the abscess and it recurs, a keratoma must be considered as the underlying cause.  X-rays of the hoof are required to make the diagnosis but a keratoma can appear to be other diseases on the x-ray, and all keratomas do not show up on an x-ray.  A keratoma is soft tissue so you will not see it unless it causes a defect in the bone, which is common but not always there. In this case, an MRI may be required to make the diagnosis.  Treatment requires surgical removal of the mass. Usually the hoof wall has to be removed in order to get rid of the tumor unless it is located at the sole, and then a hole in the sole is made to remove the tumor.  Generally, these horses heal well but 6-12 months is usually required for complete healing.

Category: Coronary Band Dystrophy in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A condition newly recognized in horses is called coronary band dystrophy. The coronary band is the area at the top of the horse’s hoof that separates the hoof wall from the skin. Dystrophy in this case refers to a disorder that causes the tissue at the top of the hoof wall to weaken or waste away. Several diseases can affect this area but with coronary band dystrophy the horse’s hair above the coronary band sticks out straight instead of laying down against the skin. There is crusting, scaling, redness, and ulceration of the tissue. A hard band of tissue will develop at the coronary band and the hoof wall will stop growing, which causes the growth rings on the dorsal hoof wall to be tightly packed. The crusting and scaling will extend down the hoof wall and can even involve the frog. An ulcerous condition called canker can develop. Some horses will be lame. The disease usually occurs in heavier breeds of horses, like warmbloods. A biopsy is the best method of diagnosing the condition, but biopsy sites are difficult to heal so the diagnosis is usually made with an exam given by your veterinarian. If coronary band dystrophy is diagnosed, prednisolone, a strong anti-inflammatory steroid given orally, is often part of the treatment, as the disease is believed to be immune-mediated. Antibiotics are usually used to treat potential low-grade infections, and an NSAID may be prescribed for pain. Do not add any additional medications to your horse's treatment plan unless your veterinarian has instructed you to do so, no matter what condition your horse is being treated for. Treatment also involves removing shoes from your horse and clipping the hair at the coronary band. Your horse’s heels should be trimmed on the same plane as the frog and all loose and unhealthy tissue should be removed with a rasp. Cleaning the area daily and applying a cortisone ointment usually is an effective treatment. If canker is involved, treatment of the diseased tissue with cryotherapy is usually needed. Although the condition usually heals with treatment, the treatment is time-consuming and requires your commitment.

Category: Corticosteroids Clearance Times Following Joint Injections in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Corticosteroids are the mainstay of joint treatment in performance horses and are used routinely. However, there are regulations governing the use of these drugs in performance horses in various events, and it is important to make sure your horses does not have excessive cortisone in the blood when tested. Due to their potent antiinflammatory effects, using corticosteroids close to the time of competition is illegal due to its ability to mask injuries. After being injected in a joint, several of the common corticosteroids have been tested at a certain level, and we have found an appropriate timeframe during which the horse must not be used in an event after being injected. That period of time is seven days for triamcinolone, 21 days for Depo-Medrol, and seven days for betamethasone; those are the three most commonly used drugs with which to inject horse joints. Since there is no actual recommended dosage of these drugs and there is no actual limit for the number of joints injected, the horses could be injected with these drugs and show positive on drug tests, which could cause disqualification. A study was published in Equine Veterinary Education that studied the use of several different corticosteroids injected in multiple joints either alone or separately and found that triamcinolone and Depo-Medrol were cleared at seven and 21 days respectively as expected. However, betamethasone was detected above normal limits up to 10 days after joint injection, not seven. So all of this means that if you are showing performance horses and are injecting their joints, it is important to know the product used and the withdrawal period of the drug.

Category: Cortisone and Laminitis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most commonly used medications in horses is cortisone and yet there is some concern about cortisone causing founder in horses.  Most of the cortisone used in horses is used in the joints to treat performance horses for arthritis although it is often used for skin allergies as well.  When you hear someone saying they had their horse’s joints injected, 90% of the time a form of cortisone was used as part of the medication.  First of all, I want to say that there is no scientific evidence that giving cortisone to horses causes laminitis and founder, and the condition is extremely rare.  However, several studies have shown that a small percentage of horses with laminitis have been administered cortisone.  Normal doses of cortisone have been used routinely with no side effects and most horses that have developed laminitis and foundered have been given large doses. The drug triamcinolone is considered one of the types of cortisone most likely to cause a problem.  Triamcinolone, or Vetalog, is commonly used in high motion joints in horses.  There is no normal total approved dosage for triamcinolone in horses but many veterinarians believe about 20 mg is the most that should be used.  However, many horses with multiple joint problems require more than this and dosages up to 30 and 40 mg are commonly used with no side effects.  Dosages above 80 mg are believed to increase the risk of laminitis and because these drugs can affect a horse for a period of time after injection, it is a concern to inject joints on horses too often.  Also, horses that may be susceptible to laminitis or founder, such as overweight horses, may be more likely to founder after cortisone injections.   So be aware that if your veterinarian is using cortisone on your horse, foundering is a small possibility.

Category: Crooked Tail Carriage in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Your horse’s tail is controlled by several different muscles. When moving at a walk and trot, the tail swings equally from side to side. Research from the University of Cambridge shows the normal movement of the lower back is symmetrical at a trot in non-lame horses. Hind limb lameness may cause unevenness of movement and can affect the movement of the tail. It is believed some horses show hind limb lameness by holding their tail to one side or the other, which can be associated with performance-related problems. To figure out the importance of crooked tail findings, a study was performed in the United Kingdom on 500 lame horses and 200 non-lame horses. Results showed that crooked tail carriage occurred more often in lame horses compared to non-lame horses. However, the direction of the tail was not correlated with the side of the lameness. More horses with crooked tails deviated to the left side versus the right side which could be due to rider unevenness. Crooked tail carriage was associated with sacroiliac joint region pain and increased tension of the muscles in the upper back without pain in the upper back. When horses with crooked tails were placed in a circle, the crooked tail carriage increased in the direction of the crooked tail. Using a local anesthetic to numb the pain from the lameness did not resolve the crooked tail. There are variables other than lameness affecting tail carriage. If your horse has a crooked tail and carries it to one side or the other, you may want to have your veterinarian check for lameness or other cause.

Category: Diagnosing Lameness in a Horse’s Rear Legs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the hardest types of lameness to diagnose is a slight lameness in a horse’s rear leg.  The signs are not as easy to see in a back leg as in a front leg. Many times you cannot see a lameness at all, but an experienced rider can feel that the horse is off and not moving correctly.  The rear legs are also more difficult to diagnose because it is more dangerous to examine the rear legs of some horses than the forelegs.  Many horses resent it when someone picks up and flexes their back legs and checks for pain, and this places the veterinarian in a potentially dangerous situation.  Also, one of the main techniques we use to diagnose lameness in a horse is nerve blocks, which involves sticking a needle under the skin and numbing a nerve to see if it improves the lameness.  This is routinely performed on the forelimbs but it can be much more dangerous on the back limbs, and some horses will simply not allow you to do nerve blocks without sedation.  However, if you sedate the horse, then it is difficult to determine the effect the sedative has on the lameness. For this reason, a group of veterinarians in Brazil used a device to cause a temporary lameness on the rear leg of a group of horses and then administered various sedatives and pain medications to see the effect on the lameness.  They determined that it was possible to use a low dose of xylazine and tobuterol intravenously prior to a nerve block, and this did not have an effect on visualizing the lameness in a rear leg for up to 40 minutes after the sedation.  However, the same could not be said of the forelegs as the sedation significantly affected a lameness there and prevented an accurate diagnosis.  This information will allow veterinarians to examine rear leg lameness in difficult horses and do so with less danger.

Category: Equine Reflex Hypertonia (Stringhalt)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine Reflex Hypertonia is an abnormal gait caused by a neuromuscular condition. It is more commonly called “stringhalt” because the jerky, hesitant hyperflexion of the horse’s affected hind limb (or limbs) resembles a puppet being pulled by a string. Your horse may walk with an exaggerated movement, holding the affected hind limb up unnaturally high before setting it down again. This odd gait is more obvious at the walk and less at the trot or canter. It may seem worse when your horse backs up, turns, or starts to walk after standing still. What Causes Stringhalt? Stringhalt is usually divided into two types: idiopathic (meaning the cause is not known) or acquired, also called Australian or plant/pasture associated. Pasture-associated stringhalt:(PSH) Usually occurs when a horse has been kept on pasture during the late summer or early autumn when forage is not at its best quality or if toxic plants have been allowed to grow. Horses grazing in different pastures but in the same general area may develop it as the same toxic plants can grow across a wide area. Certain types of toxic weeds found in Australia, New Zealand and the US have been associated with the condition. If overgrazing, drought, or other issues have left a pasture in poor nutritional condition, horses may eat plants that they otherwise wouldn’t touch. But horses are foragers, so it’s natural for them to sample things even if they are on a well-maintained pasture. Plant-associated stringhalt is not very common in the United States. Toxic Weeds Known to Cause Stringhalt The weedHypochaeris radicata,commonly called false dandelion, is native to Europe but also grows in several other countries (giving this type of stringhalt the name Australian or pasture-associated), including North and South America. This weed is hard to tell from genuine dandelions, which are not toxic. The sweet pea plant,Lathyrus spp.,also found in the US, is another suspected contributor to plant-associated stringhalt. Plant-associated stringhalt usually clears up when the horse is removed from the source. Australian (idiopathic) stringhalt:The cause is unknown, and with this type, the condition may be progressive and can be quite severe. Treatment If your horse’s condition is due to plant toxicity, it should clear up after the toxins are removed, and no further treatment is needed. In the case of idiopathic stringhalt, your horse may recover on their own. In chronic cases, surgical intervention can be a possibility. The surgery involves the tendons and muscles of the affected limbs, and recovery and outcome depend on the severity of the condition and the horse’s overall health. Not all cases respond to surgery. Other treatments may include thiamine, a vitamin B1 supplement, and phenytoin, an anticonvulsant. Stringhalt is considered an unsoundness but it doesn’t necessarily mean your horse cannot have a fulfilling life. Signs may be sporadic and may even disappear during warm weather. However, the condition may make your horse unsuitable for some equestrian activities. If you suspect your horse is showing signs of stringhalt, your veterinarian is your best resource for advice and treatment information.

Category: Examining your Horse's Foot
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English All horses are individuals and as such have differences in their feet. However, there are some keys that you can look for when checking a horse feet that may give you an idea that there is a problem with a hoof. First of all, the dorsal hoof wall at the front of the foot should be straight from the coronary band to the toe. Dr. Andy Parks from the University of Georgia indicates in the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) proceedings that any deviation of the dorsal hoof wall usually indicates the horse has had laminitis, especially if the surface of the wall is concave and the sole is flat. If the hoof is distorted at the front of the hoof wall at the coronary band, it is likely that the horse has excessive bone growth on the coffin bone, which is called buttress foot.  If you see a small area of swelling at the coronary band that may be painful, it is likely a hoof abscess that is going to rupture at the coronary band. If the swelling begins at the coronary band and extends up to the pastern, it is more likely an infection in the tissue, whereas if the infection is completely around the coronary band only, the problem is most likely in the coffin joint. You can also closely examine the rings in the hoof wall by looking from the side. The rings should be parallel from the coronary band to the toe and if these are not parallel, it usually indicates the heel and the toe are not growing evenly for some reason. Lastly, a lot can be learned by picking up the foot and looking at the sole and frog. The front foot should basically be as long as it is wide, and the widest part of the foot should be at a point that is at half the length. If this is not the case, the horse is trimmed incorrectly or the foot is deformed. Check your horse’s feet against these parameters and if you observe a problem ask your veterinarian.

Category: Feeding Horses with Pasture-Associated Laminitis
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Laminitis is a painful and serious condition of horse's feet and it can lead to founder. Although most folks think of founder developing in horses who are eating large quantities of grain, more horses develop laminitis and founder on pasture grass due to the high concentration of carbohydrates in the grass than those eating grain. Pasture-associated laminitis usually occurs in horses that are susceptible to laminitis and those are horses that are usually overweight, are easy keepers, and have equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing's disease. In these susceptible horses, it has been recommended to decrease the amount of pasture and so lots of folks try to decrease the amount of time horses are grazing. However, a study has shown that when horses are restricted from pasture for a part of the day, they increase the amount of grass they eat when they are on pasture and so restricting the time on pasture is not effective unless it is severely restricted to just a few minutes a day. Also, there are differences in carbohydrate concentration in the grass depending on the time of day. Because of photosynthesis that occurs with sunlight during the day, grass in the early morning has less carbohydrate than grass in the afternoon. So if you are going to allow a horse to graze for a few minutes per day, it would be safer to allow this grazing in the early morning versus the late afternoon. Another management practice that should be considered in these susceptible horses is the amount of food the horse receives at a meal. A study out of Ohio State has shown that horses that are fed smaller meals more frequently have lower insulin levels and lower insulin decreases the chance of laminitis developing.

Category: Foot Injuries in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Foot injuries are quite common in horses. Many result from barbed wire and other sharp objects. Some of these wounds may be minor, but because of the important and susceptible structures of the foot, any foot injury can be potentially deadly. There is very little soft tissue covering the internal structures, and cuts only one-quarter inch deep in the correct area can enter a synovial structure, such as a tendon sheath or joint. Many cuts occur on the back of the pastern just above the hoof, and the digital flexor tendon sheath is just under the skin. Any laceration in this area can affect this tendon sheath. Once infection develops in this sheath, it is difficult and expensive to cure the infection. If a nail enters the frog at the right angle, it can penetrate the fluid-filled sac surrounding the navicular bone, or even the coffin joint The most important thing to do if you have a horse with a foot injury is wrap the leg with nonstick pad, gauze and vet wrap, and call your vet. This can be an emergency situation and if you wait a few days to see how the horse does, it may be too late. Your vet will numb the area and examine the laceration closely to determine which structures are involved. If a synovial structure, such as a joint, is involved, it will be flushed. A technique called regional limb perfusion can be used to increase antibiotics in the joint. If a joint or tendon sheath is involved, most of these horses need to be at a referral center as they are critical care cases. General anesthesia may be required several days in a row to treat the wound correctly. The main point is that if your horse gets a cut around the foot, do not hesitate but call your vet.

Category: Fractures in a Horse’s Back More Common than Suspected
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Fractures in the back of racehorses are more common than previously thought, according to a new study. Dr. Liz Collar said at the AAEP convention that lumbar vertebral fractures can be catastrophic for racehorses and the jockey.  The lumbar area is about 3-4 hand widths behind the rear of the saddle and these fractures occurred more commonly in quarter horses than thoroughbreds.  At the University of Tennessee, a study looked at anatomical findings in the lumbosacral spine of 16 quarter horses that were euthanized for reasons other than lumbosacral disease. The horses were newborn to 22 years of age, including only one racehorse. Interesting findings were that out of the 16 horses, all had six lumbar vertebrae except one only had five vertebrae.  Almost 70 % of the horses had disease in the facet joints where the vertebral processes attach to the spinal processes and 62% had disease of the intervertebral discs.  So over 60% of the horses has disease in their spinal area and since the study included very young horses, it is likely that most mature quarter horses have some degree of spinal disease that increases as they age.  Nine of these horses had lesions in the bones indicating regions of stress and could lead to a stress fracture.  Also, 92% of the horses had some cartilage retention in the growth plate that should have become bone, which indicates stress in the growth plates not found in other areas of the horse’s body.  Conclusions of her study were that lumbosacral growth plates are inactive in quarter horses by 2 years of age and disease in the horse’s lower back seems to be much more common than was previously thought.

Category: Frequency of Joint Injections in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most joint injections are used to treat arthritis and are commonly given to performance horses. It seems the frequency of these injections is open to debate. Erin Contino, DVM, Dipl. ACVSMR, says in the publicationThe Horsethat many veterinarians are hesitant to inject joints too frequently, but frequency depends on the practitioner. Arthritis Treatment Arthritis damages cartilage and bone, which leads to inflammation. The purpose of injecting the joint is to relieve pain and lameness. There are multiple options for treating arthritis, including oral and systemic injections for pain and inflammation. Research has shown that triamcinolone, one of the medications commonly injected into joints, can protect the cartilage to some degree. Other Treatment Options Although cortisone is the most common medication used in arthritic joints, there are many others, including regenerative therapy like platelet-rich plasma and stem cells. Hyaluronic acid can be injected into joints and is commonly injected along with cortisone. Shock wave therapy has also been used in treating arthritic joints. There is no standard on how often to inject a horse’s joints, but some veterinarians try to limit joint injections to twice a year. However, you can have too much of a good thing. If the injections are effective for a shorter and shorter period, your horse's arthritis is likely worsening, and the injections are no longer effective. Again, there is no scientifically proven time interval, but if you have to have your horse’s joints injected more than twice a year, it is likely other treatments should be considered. Many trainers and owners want their horse’s joints injected on a routine basis for maintenance. Because there is always the chance of joint infection with an injection, horses should only be injected when they have a diagnosed problem in a joint.

Category: Hindlimb Suspensory Ligament Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The suspensory ligament is a structure that begins just below the knee and hock on the back of the horse's legs and extends downward to the fetlock. The particular injury I am going to talk about today is inflammation of the suspensory ligament just below the hock in the rear legs. This ligament is positioned between the bones and soft tissues and there is really no ability for the ligament to expand so inflammation causes pain because it cannot expand and can compress the surrounding nerves causing pain. Dr. Sue Dyson indicates in the Equine Veterinarian that horses with a damaged ligament in this area may be very lame or may just perform poorly. Diagnosis of the condition is aided by ultrasound and looking at the fibers of the ligament compared to the normal ligament on the other leg. Also, a nerve block of the area is usually required to prove the lameness is due to pain in this area and in some cases even an MRI is required for diagnosis. As far as treatment, rest alone is not a successful therapy as only 14% of these horses were able to return to work for at least one year. Shock wave therapy was effective in about 40% of the cases. One of the newest therapies is surgery to cut the nerve to the area of the injury (called neurectomy) and then opening the tissue to decrease pressure on the ligament, which is called a fasciotomy. Results of a study that consisted of 92 horses with only suspensory ligament disease that were treated with neurectomy and fasciotomy indicated 78% of them returned to the same level of work they were at before the injury for at least one year. Suspensory ligament disease is difficult to successfully treat and surgery seems to be the best option.

Category: Hip and Pelvic Issues in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most lameness in horses is due to issues with the feet, but some lameness can originate from the hip and pelvic area. Dr. Thomas Daniel Jr., DVM, writes inThe Horsethat many hip and pelvic issues are underdiagnosed in performance horses. Dr. Daniel says inflammation is seen at and around the sacroiliac joint. It has been shown that the pelvis is overlooked partly because problems in this area are difficult to diagnose, as we can better image the other joints. In the past, we had only X-rays, and taking X-rays of a horse’s pelvis is difficult because of their size, and the process requires general anesthesia. We now have better diagnostic tools. Ultrasound is readily available to most equine practitioners and can be helpful in determining the size of ligaments in the horse’s hip and pelvis, but nuclear scintigraphy (bone scan) is much more effective. This test involves injecting the horse with a radioactive material. The sedated horse is scanned with a gamma camera. Areas of increased radioactive uptake show up as hot spots and show areas of bone remodeling. The four main conditions affecting the horse’s pelvis include fracture or dislocation of the pelvis, sacroiliac strain, or osteoarthritis. Dr. Robin Dabareiner,DVM, DACVS, PLLC , from Caldwell, Texas, says many of these conditions require extended rest for several months. Anti-inflammatories can also be used, and corticosteroid injections can be performed in the sacroiliac joint. Previously, these joints were difficult to inject, but the injections are now more accurate due to the ability to see the needle entering the joint using ultrasound. Horses with pelvic injuries often require months of physical therapy to return to their former level of performance, but recovery times vary based on the individual horse and the injury they suffered.

Category: Hock Arthrodesis with Ethyl Alcohol in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most common causes of lameness in horses is arthritis of the lower hock joints. Almost all hard-working horses over the age of 5 will have some pathology in these joints. If you have heard horse owners say they have had their horse's hocks injected, these are the joints I am talking about. There are many different treatments for hock arthritis including injecting the joints with cortisone and hyaluronic acid. Also, sometimes people ride horses while the horse is on anti-inflammatories like bute, and many of them are on oral joints supplements with glucosamine. However, some of these horses are so severely affected that many of these treatments are ineffective or at least do not last very long. The next step in treatment is to arthrodese the joints, or destroy the joints so that the bones grow together. This decreases the pain in the area because if there is no longer a joint then there is no arthritis pain. In the past, destroying the joint was a surgical procedure accomplished with a laser or by drilling out the cartilage in the joint. These are expensive procedures and the veterinarians at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine performed a study on another method of destroying the joints by injecting ethyl alcohol into the joints. Ethyl alcohol is injected after making sure only the lower hock joints would be affected. Of the 16 horses in the study, all 16 were pain free after 6 months. So if you have a performance horse that routinely has the hocks injected but are still having problems, ask your vet about ethyl alcohol injection.

Category: Hoof Pain Treatment in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses commonly develop foot pain from abscesses to bruises but one of the most common reasons for foot pain is laminitis and founder. Horses that develop this condition, regardless of the cause, are in significant pain and some cannot walk or even stand. There are many different treatments for laminitis but one important treatment is to support the sole with something soft to decrease pain but hopefully prevent displacement of the coffin bone. The coffin bone is the bone in the hoof and with severe laminitis, this bone rotates away from the hoof wall, similar to pulling off a person's fingernail. There are many methods to accomplish this support and many veterinarians use a soft Styrofoam pad that supports the hoof but will compress and help with pain. I have used these Styrofoam pads for years and like them but since they compress, they have to be changed every 24 hours to continue to be effective. Another possibility is to place the horse in a stall with 6 to 8 inches of deep soft sand that will not compact. The concern with this method is that soft sand that will not compact is difficult to find and it takes a truck load of sand to fill most stalls, so sometimes availability is difficult. Dr. Mike Steward from Oklahoma indicates in the International Equine Veterinarian that he uses a pad made of ethylene vinyl acetate or EVA. This material is light weight but durable and deformable, and keeps its shape for weeks. This pad can be taped on the foot and trimmed as needed, depending on the needs of a horse as determined by X-rays. If you have a horse that has foundered, ask your vet about an EVA shoe.

Category: Hoof Wall Cracks in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hoof cracks are common in horses. While some are minor and can be treated with just trimming, others can cause severe lameness and treatment is more involved.In most cases, the cause of a hoof crack is due to abnormal stress on the hoof wall.Dr. Scott Pleasant indicates in the Practitioner that the hoof capsule adapts and changes shape according to how it is loaded, and the hoof wall grows slower in areas where the majority of the weight is borne. When stress and strain become excessive, hoof cracks occur so if you have a horse who has them, it is likely there is an imbalance on the load applied on the hoof and the hoof capsule is unstable.For example, toe cracks are commonly noted in horses with long toes and low heels so if you see toe cracks, it is very likely the toes are too long.The long toe causes excessive leverage on the hoof wall in the toe and this leads to small incomplete cracks.If the problem is neglected, the cracks become larger and deeper, and eventually lead to lameness.Quarter cracks commonly develop because the foot is not balanced from outside to inside, which is called a mediolateral balance.To trim either the long toe or sides of the foot correctly, x-rays are required to see where the bone is inside the hoof so you can determine how short to trim the toe and how to level the hoof from side to side.There are many techniques to treat these cracks, from just trimming correctly to applying plates on the hoof wall with screws to decreasing movement of the crack.Regardless, the important thing to remember is that hoof cracks happen because of hoof instability and this must be treated to prevent further cracks from occurring.

Category: How Hind Hooves Are Trimmed Can Affect Your Horse’s Posture
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Yogi Sharp, DipWCF, BSc Hons., based in Brighton, England,and founder ofThe EquineDocumentalist,indicates in the publicationThe Horsethat when a horse’s hind hooves are out of balance, this could mean poor posture, leading to other difficulties for the horse. Abnormal trimming of a horse’s hind feet could contribute to a cycle of issues that could cause problems all the way up the rear legs to the back, neck, and even the head. Specifically, a long toe and low heel conformation cause horses to have a so-called “canted-in” or “standing under” posture and can even be linked to jaw pain. As a farrier, Dr. Sharp says that he regularly manages horses with a canted-in posture in which their hind feet are pulled up under the trunk. This is common when a horse has low heels and long toes and is called abnormal compensated posture, requiring increased effort of the horse's muscles to maintain and can lead to muscular pain. He said all the horses he works with that have poor hind-foot balance also have terrible posture, and he believes some of this is due to domestication. In one study, 12 horses with negative plantar angles were examined. This abnormal condition is when the back of the coffin bone is lower than the front of the coffin bone. The 12 subject horses were all standing with their back feet further forward than normal, and Dr. Sharp trimmed and shod the horses to create a straight hoof pastern axis by using wedge pads. The researchers found significant improvement in angles and posture after treatment, concluding that the position and orientation of the rear hooves can affect the positioning of other joints. The hind feet are commonly overlooked in horses as most of the focus is on the front feet. From this research, it is concluded that a horse’s hind feet need to be examined more closely, and if long toes and low heels are noted, a change in conformation could positively affect the entire horse.

Category: Infrared Thermography for Diagnosing Lameness in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Infrared thermography is a diagnostic modality used in horses. This technology is not new as it was introduced about 50 years ago but seems to be increasing in popularity for lameness diagnosis in horses. The technology works on the premise that the horse's body surface emits infrared radiation that can be detected by an infrared camera. The camera provides a colored image that shows the variation of different areas of body temperature, and the theory is that inflamed areas will show up on the image to help localize the area of lameness. The technology has been shown to be useful when guidelines established by theAmerican Academy of Thermology (AAT)for veterinary thermal imaging are followed, and the exam is performed and interpreted by a veterinarian experienced with the technology. However, there are many non-veterinarians that have purchased this equipment and are performing thermal scans, but they are not using correct guidelines and are not interpreting the images correctly. These non-veterinarians are also making diagnoses, which is actually illegal for anyone but a veterinarian. However, the most important thing is that in most cases, these non-veterinarians are charging horse owners for scans that are basically useless. I recently was forwarded a scan by a client and the person performing the scan suspected the horse had equine protozoal myeloencephalitis; EPM is a protozoal disease that affects the nervous system, and there is no scientific evidence that the disease can be diagnosed by a thermal scan. If someone recommends a thermal scan for your horse, research the person scanning, ask your veterinarian for an opinion, and contact AAT about veterinary thermal imaging before spending money on this modality.

Category: Initial Treatment of Tendon Injuries in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Tendon injuries are fairly common in horses. Tendons attach muscle to bone and are prone to injury butthere are some initial treatments to use for these injuries In the publicationThe Horse,Sherry Johnson, DVM, MS, DACVSMR, saysthat injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon is the primary reason for the retirement of thoroughbred racehorses. The initial injury is bad enough, but reinjury rates of this tendon are as high as 82%. The superficial digital flexor tendon is on the back of your horse’s leg, starting at the knee or hock and extending down to the pastern. It is crucial to treat these possible tendon injuries correctly when they first occur. The first signs of injury are heat, swelling, and pain. Other diseases can lead to these symptoms, so you should contact your veterinarian immediately if you think your horse has an injury. However, there are some areas where you cannot see the swelling, such as a deep digital flexor tendon injury inside the hoof capsule. If you suspect a tendon injury or see any signs, get off your horse, walk the horse to a stall, and call your veterinarian. The first treatment is to ice the leg for 48 hours. This will reduce inflammation and pain regardless of the diagnosis. Anti-inflammatories are probably going to be needed, but it is best to wait until your veterinarian examines your horse to start these medications. You can apply a wrap if the lower leg is involved, but be sure you know the correct way to do this. You must use full-thickness cotton under the wrap to avoid too much pressure. Tissue repair, remodeling, and scar tissue formation will occur over the next 60 days, and it is crucial that your veterinarian does an initial ultrasound exam to determine the treatment plan and then monitor healing with ultrasound. Depending on the location and degree of injury, multiple treatments, and rehabilitation options exist for tendon injuries.

Category: Is Hot or Cold Treatment Best for Horse’s Tendon Injury?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses commonly develop soft tissue injuries and some folks use heat on these injuries and some use cold therapy.  Dr. Kevin Haussler with the Colorado State Veterinary Orthopedic Laboratory indicates in The Horse magazine that humans with soft tissue injuries are now commonly treated with cold and warm temperatures in quick succession with heat greater than 104°F and cold less than 59°F.  At these temperatures, they are using only mild heating and cooling of the tissues.  This technique in humans has been shown to help post-exercise recovery, help treat acute soft tissue injuries, and improve neurological recovery.  This is in contrast to previous recommendations for soft tissue injuries of cold for the first 48 hours and then heat application. Dr. Haussler indicated some horses don’t tolerate cold well and heat incorrectly applied can cause inflammation instead of decreasing inflammation.  Because of this, he developed a pneumatic sleeve for applying this cold and heat therapy to the lower limbs of horses that alternates between cold and heat every 15 minutes for 2 hours.  The pneumatic sleeve was effective at skin, subcutaneous tissues, and the superficial digital flexor tendon as these tissues reached the desired temperature, but the deeper tendons like the deep digital flexor did not reach the desired temperature.  He indicated there is a lack of research in many areas of equine rehab and more research is needed to determine if this is effective in horses, the time intervals that are most effective and the temperatures that are the most effective.  Dr. Haussler agreed that typically we use cold for acute injuries and heat for chronic injuries but by alternating heat and cold, we can potentially tap into additional mechanisms to manage injuries in horses.

Category: Kissing Spines in Horses is Hereditary
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Kissing spines (overriding dorsal spinous processes), where the vertebrae are too close together to the point of touching or overlapping, is a cause of back pain in horses. New research shows the condition may be hereditary.  A research team found chromosomes 16 and 25 appear to have regions that affect the severity of kissing spines in warmbloods, thoroughbreds, and stock horses.  At the AAEP convention, Dr. Samantha Brooks from Florida and Dr. Beau Whitaker from Salado, Texas presented that a third chromosome, number 14, appears to be associated with the presence of kissing spines in affected horses and determines if the disease is present in a specific horse.  Because of this, it is not recommended to breed horses with kissing spines. The researchers have been performing genetic testing on horses without kissing spines to locate genes responsible for the disease and found that changes on chromosome 16 increased the chance of kissing spines by one grade while changes on chromosome 25 increased the chances of kissing spines by two grades.  So, a horse affected with both genes has a three grade increase in chances of having a kissing spine, and this is not a small amount.  The horse’s height also increases the chance of kissing spines, but age and sex of the horse have less impact. This new information is worth checking out before training a horse since affected horses should have a less strenuous career such as leisure riding versus upper-level dressage or reining.  Also, if you know your horse is at risk and the horse seems painful or has decreased performance, the horse’s back is one area to examine first.  Treatment for kissing spines can be injections in the back or surgery. Surgery seems to be the most effective.  Hopefully, further research will aid in decreasing this equine problem.

Category: Lacerations to the Horse’s Hoof Wall
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the common injuries veterinarians see in horses is one in which the hoof wall is detached from the underneath tissue that is correctly called an avulsion of the hoof wall. Some of these injuries involve only the hoof wall while others also involve the coronary band. If the hoof wall has become detached from the underneath tissue, it must be removed surgically. If the coronary band is involved, sometimes it can be sutured. It is important to have your vet examine any wound to the foot as there are a lot of serious structures in the hoof that can be deadly if involved. Your vet will check to make sure that no joints or tendon sheaths are involved and also to clean and flush the area well. The hoof will likely have to be numbed with local anesthetic to carefully examine the area and if no other structures are involved, skin and coronary band tissue can be sutured and the hoof wall that has become detached can be removed. The hoof is then bandaged with antibiotic medication. In some cases, the hoof wall can become completely unattached and has to be surgically removed. Even in this case, the horse can survive if the wound is treated properly, although that involves a long period of treatment. Failure to treat these hoof wall injuries will certainly lead to a defect in the hoof wall that usually lead to lameness. If your horse has an injury to the hoof wall or to any area on the lower leg, remember that wounds in this area can be deadly. It is important to call your vet and have all of these wounds examined immediately as delaying treatment of those wounds can be very serious.

Category: Lameness Evaluation in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Lameness is common in horses.A lameness examination is one of the most common exams performed by equine veterinarians. In some cases, determining the leg that is lame is really easy if the lameness is moderate to severe. However, if the lameness is mild, especially in a hind leg, it can be difficult and sometimes dangerous to determine which leg is lame. If the horse is lame in more than one leg, it can be very difficult to make a diagnosis, especially if the lameness is in one hind and one foreleg. Some horses will appear to be lame on one leg when the horse is actually compensating for lameness in another leg. A group in Scotland found that lameness diagnosis of the foreleg is much easier than the hind leg and they did a three-year study of 37 horses with lameness in rear legs. About half of the 37 had lameness in the hind legs only, one-third had lameness in both limbs on the same side, and a few had lameness in a hind leg and foreleg of opposite sides. They found that some horses with a hind limb lameness can appear to also be lame on the forelimb of the same side. It is not a true lameness, however, as the horse is trying to get off the rear leg and off load the lame hind leg. And when the lame rear limb was blocked or numbed with a local anesthetic, the altered gait of the foreleg was gone. However, if the lameness was in the opposite hind limb and forelimb, blocking or numbing the lame rear leg did not stop the appearance of lameness in the foreleg. To make matters even more complicated, if the front leg is lame, the opposite hind limb will show a false lameness but a lame rear leg does not show false lameness in the opposite foreleg. I know this is confusing and this is the reason some lameness cases are not easy and why it can take your veterinarian some time to correctly diagnose these lameness cases.

Category: Laminitis in Donkeys
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Laminitis is a severe foot disease in horses and can also affect donkeys, although the causes of the syndrome may be different between the species. Veterinary opinions vary on whether donkeys can develop the syndrome. Horses develop laminitis because they are overweight and eat a diet high in carbohydrates. In the publication,The HorseDr. Nicola Menzies-Gow, Diplomate of the European College of Equine Internal Medicine in England, states that donkeys affected by laminitis are younger than horses affected, and are not always overweight, don't eat too many carbohydrates, or have other health problems. Researchers found that nearly 50% of the donkeys studied developed at least one episode of laminitis compared to 34% of horses and ponies. Forty percent of the donkeys had at least one recurring episode, and most of the donkeys had chronic, rather than acute, laminitis. Laminitis involves inflammation of the structures in the hoof wall that hold the bone in place. Inflammation of the laminae is extremely painful. Cushing’s disease in donkeys can contribute to the development of laminitis as it can in horses. While most horses develop the disease in the spring due to ingesting spring grass, most cases in donkeys in England occurred in the winter from October to February when the animals were coming off pasture and into stalls. It is believed laminitis may be related to the environment of walking on concrete in a barn, and the lameness was simply more noticeable on concrete versus out on the pasture. Regardless, laminitis may develop in donkeys with or without the usual influencing factors noted in horses.

Category: Longeing’s Potential Effect on Your Horse’s Joints
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Longeing is the exercise of working a horse in a circle on a long lead while the trainer stands in the middle of the circle as the horse moves around the trainer. It’s a common method of exercising horses, but there is some concern that this procedure could damage equine joints. Dr. Brian Nielsen, PhD, MS, PAS, Dipl. ACAN, writes in the publicationThe Horsethat there is some anecdotal evidence supporting the relationship between circular exercise and joint disease. As anecdotal evidence is not proven by scientific studies, Michigan State University is starting a project to determine how much damage may occur depending on the size of the circle and the speed at which the horse is exercising. The concern with the circular exercise is that while turning, the load-bearing surface of the joint is greatly reduced, so the load is increased on the load-bearing part of the joint. Another way of saying this is that the force that normally gets distributed equally over the entire joint surface in straight-line exercise is concentrated on a much smaller area when exercising in a circle. This is unlikely to be a problem if done infrequently or at slow speeds, but longeing your horse at higher speeds as part of a training program day after day could cause joint damage. Dr. Nielsen says it would be the same for us if we were to run in a small circle. It’s likely we would develop knee and ankle pain over time. Horses are also much heavier than humans, and yet their leg joints are not that much larger compared to their weight. Joint injuries and arthritis are extremely common in horses, and we don’t want to do anything during training to injure their joints. Discuss with your veterinarian any concerns you may have about lungeing your horse.

Category: Lower Leg Problems in Newborn Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English All newborn foals should have their legs examine closely. Foals can have a number of leg issues that should be addressed early in their lives. Look at the foal’s legs while the foal is standing and walking to check for any lameness or unusual gait. Watch for outward rotation of the leg causing the feet to point outward more than normal. Also, make sure the limbs are relatively straight when looking at the foal from the front and the back. When looking from the side, the leg should be mostly straight with a normal hoof pastern axis. Some abnormalities require immediate treatment while other problems may correct with limited exercise. Foals should have their first hoof trimming at one month. The sole should be cleaned with a wire brush and only a rasp should be used at the heels so the heel is on the same plane as the frog. You can round the toe but do not remove any sole at this point because the sole is very thin and sole removal can lead to lameness and other problems. You may have heard to lower the hoof wall on the outside of the hoof if the foal is toed out and remove the inner hoof wall if the foal is toed in. Dr. Tracy Turner DVM, MS, Diplomate, Am Col Vet Surgery, Diplomate, Am Col Vet Sports Med and Rehab, Fellow, Am Academy Thermology, said in The Practitioner that this is incorrect. The foot should always be trimmed level as trimming unevenly may cause skeletal problems later in life. There are multiple potential problems with a foal’s legs including rotating outward, deviated inward or outward, laxity of tendons, or too much contraction of the muscles and tendons. Each of these requires specific treatments so if you have a foal with an unusual leg issue, call your veterinarian to determine the best course of action. Do not wait as some treatments are age and time sensitive.

Category: Muscular Disorders in Athletic Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The condition of tying up (muscle breakdown) is the painful muscle disorder most horse people have probably heard about. It is muscle breakdown that results in cramping.  However, tying up is more complicated than you might think. Dr. Erica McKenzie indicates in Equine Disease Quarterly that tying up is actually divided into three distinct disorders that are heritable and therefore affect certain breeds. Currently, the most clearly defined muscular disorders of athletic breeds are polysaccharide storage myopathy, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, and glycogen branching enzyme deficiency because the genetic mutations causing these diseases have been found.  Polysaccharide storage myopathy is common in quarter horses and related breeds and typically causes signs of tying up.  Standardbreds and thoroughbreds also have a disorder causing tying up with clinical signs that usually occurs during training rather than racing.  The disorder is called recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis and it appears to be more common in faster horses and the genetics of the disease in thoroughbreds and standardbreds is still unknown despite many years of work.  Warmblood and Arabian horses might also share a disorder called myofibrillar myopathy, which causes tying up in Arabians as well as poorly defined movement abnormalities in warmbloods.  The genetic cause of the syndromes in Arabians, warmbloods and thoroughbreds is unknown and no genetic tests are available for the condition.  However, there is a genetic test that looks for polysaccharide storage myopathy in at least one type of tying up in quarter horses and related breeds.  So, if you have a horse that ties up frequently, depending on the breed, there may be some genetic testing available to help diagnose the condition.

Category: Navicular Bursal Injection in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about navicular syndrome in horses as this is one of the most common causes of lameness in their front feet. The navicular bone is boat-shaped, which is why it's called the navicular bone. It is located at the back of the horse's foot and when arthritis develops in the joint or damage to the soft tissue around the bone develops, lameness occurs. One key is that horses with navicular syndrome usually respond to pain with hoof testers over the frog. Hoof testers are a sort of pliers that allows you to place pressure over certain areas of the foot, and the examiner watches for the horse's response to determine areas of pain. To determine if the lameness is originating in the foot, nerve blocks are required to see if numbing the foot decreases the lameness and if so, you be certain at least part of the problem is in the foot. Lots of people look at a horse and say he is lame in the foot, knee or shoulder but without nerve blocks you really do not know. X-rays are important in diagnosing lameness problems but should only be used after you know the general location of the lameness. Also, especially in the case of navicular disease, x-rays can be normal and the horse can still have navicular syndrome. And just as important, horses with radiographic abnormalities may not have any lameness at all even though their navicular bones may look diseased on x-ray. The newest method of diagnosing navicular syndrome is by MRI. The advantage of an MRI is that it images soft tissue while x-rays only reveal bone disease. If you have a horse who is not performing well due to pain from the front feet, an MRI may help diagnose the problem.

Category: Navicular Lameness (Heel Pain) in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Navicular disease affects many horses and is especially common in quarter horses, thoroughbreds and warmbloods.  Multiple treatments have been used for navicular disease with varied success. With the advent of MRI and ultrasound, it has been shown that some pain from the syndrome does not even involve the navicular bone but rather soft tissue structures around the bone.  For this reason, the term navicular disease is no longer recommended and heel pain is the preferred term because the navicular bone may not be the only source of pain. However, in cases in which the bone is believed to be involved, a bisphosphonate drug has been used. The two that are approved for horses are Tilden and Osphos.  Dr. Niklas Drumm from England reported that bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by killing cells called osteoclasts that absorb bone tissue.  The drugs have been shown to help some horses with disease of the navicular bone but will not be effective if other structures than the bone are involved; however, some believe the drug also provides anti-inflammatory and pain relief as well. The drugs do not provide a long-term effect but usually are effective for a few months in the horses that do respond.  The bisphosphonates are commonly used along with routine therapy for heel pain including therapeutic shoeing and joint injections. Both of these drugs can cause potential side effects of kidney damage and colic, so their use is not without some risk.  Also, the balance of bone production and bone removal is a normal process and by preventing normal bone resorption from occurring, other problems could develop with long-term use as one of these drugs is injected into the vein and the other in the muscle, so they affect the entire horse, not just the navicular bones. Dr. Steven Colburn from California said in the Texas Equine Vet Association publication the Remuda that he previously treated all navicular cases with therapeutic shoeing, isoprene and aspirin, and then if they did not respond, he would inject the coffin joint with medication. However, he now uses Osphos and indicates up to 70% of his patients have improved. It is important for your vet to perform a complete exam with x-rays and blocking the feet to make sure of the diagnosis. In some cases, an MRI is required because heel pain can affect structures other than the navicular bone, such as ligaments around the bone. However, if x-rays indicate the bone is involved, Dr. Colburn treats the horse with Osphos (clodronate). Those inhibit bone resorption, which decreases loss of bone as bone loss is one thing that occurs in horses with navicular disease. Dr. Colburn recommends light work after the injection and you will need to stop using NSAIDs such as bute at the same time as both drugs can affect the kidneys. Some horses can develop colic after the injection, but it is usually mild and walking the horse after the injection can usually decrease symptoms. Rare signs after Osphos injection include a decreased appetite, lethargy, and injection site reactions. The safe use of Osphos has not been studied in horses younger than 4 years old and should not be used in pregnant horses, lactating mares, or those used for breeding.

Category: Neck Pain in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Neck pain in horses is not commonly diagnosed, but it may be more common than we realize in older performance horses.  Pain and stiffness in the neck can certainly be a cause of poor performance, and a change in gait may be difficult to recognize in subtle cases.  Many horses may simply be a little off and it is difficult to pinpoint the neck as the cause of the problem.  Sometimes horses will have a forelimb lameness that is due to nerve root pain starting in the neck while some horses will be resistant to turn or will even wobble in the rear legs. Dr. Carla Pasteur indicated in the Clinician that neck pain may be due to joint pathology, tendon or ligament strain, myofascial injury, or nerve inflammation.  Eliminating pain does not always solve the problem as there is usually a lack of muscle development, muscle atrophy, and abnormal muscle tension involved.  Resistance to lateral bending of the neck is considered a training issue by many folks, but if the horse is in pain or lacks neuromuscular control, training is not going to be effective.  A normal horse should be able to bring the head around to the level of the elbow at a neutral height without rotating the head and neck.  Horses that prematurely rotate the neck generally are found to have neck pain.  Arthritis in the cervical factet joints is common and can lead to nerve dysfunction, such as front leg lameness as well as neck pain and instability. Treatment involves pain medication and sometimes injecting the joints with anti-inflammatories.  Some rehabilitation techniques have been successful in strengthening the neck muscles, which aids in stabilizing the vertebral bodies, decreasing pain, and increasing lateral bend.

Category: Nutritional Tips to Prevent Tying Up Syndrome in Your Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Exertional rhabdomyolysis syndrome is the breakdown of muscle in the horse as a result of a sudden increase in intense exercise. Referred to as “tying up’, it causes muscle stiffness, can cause severe muscle damage, and can even lead to kidney damage. Feeding the correct diet can help prevent the syndrome. It can be a single occurrence or can occur as a chronic syndrome. Dr. Jennifer Madera, DVM, writes inThe Horsethat sporadic episodes occur with overwork, especially in hot and humid weather. Horses with the chronic form of the syndrome have hereditary conditions that lead to tying up. A muscle biopsy or a blood test is required to make this diagnosis. Nutrition can help prevent the sporadic form of tying up. The basis of the diet should be good quality hay and pasture. Your horse should be fed 1.5 to 2% of their body weight in hay or grass daily, which is 15-20 pounds for a 1000-pound horse, depending on your horse’s condition. Forage holds water in the gastrointestinal tract, which can help with dehydration during exercise. Feeding straight alfalfa is discouraged because it supplies high calcium levels, which can lead to metabolic imbalances and excess protein that requires the kidneys to work harder. Dr. Meg Sleeper, VMD, Dipl., ACVIM, believes in the importance of testing the nutrient content of the pasture and hay you provide to your horse. However, forage alone generally does not provide enough energy for horses participating in athletic events, and added concentrates like grain or pellets are required. It is important to feed only moderate levels of non-structural carbohydrates and a fat supplement for energy. Too much grain can lead to an increased risk of tying up due to the high levels of carbohydrates. Supplementing your athletic horse with vitamin E as an antioxidant is also a good idea.

Category: Palmar Foot Pain in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most horse people are familiar with the term navicular disease and that it indicates pain in the horse's foot. Specifically, it indicates pain in the back or palmar part of the horse's foot. Because we know it is just not related to the navicular bone, a more correct term is palmar foot pain. Many times the bone is not the major source of pain but the ligaments and tendons in the back of the horse's foot are painful and navicular disease does not describe the problem. Dr. Britt Conklin is a veterinarian and certified farrier and he indicates in Remuda magazine that although therapeutic shoeing is commonly used in many cases of foot pain, it is important to realize that when you change the angle of the foot, you may help some problems but you can create other problems. This is a common finding in one of the most common syndromes we see in horses. Many horses, especially those with thoroughbred breeding, have crushed heels. A common therapy is to raise the heels with a wedge to get the hoof in a more normal conformation and this decreases pressure on the navicular bone, decreases tension of the deep digital flexure tendon, reduces stress on the hoof capsule, and decreases deformation of the hoof capsule. By elevating the heels, many of these horses will respond and initially allow the horse to perform better. However, elevating the heels on horses that have compromised heels will further weaken and damage the heel base. So in the long run, the pain will increase by elevating the heels and will make recovery even more difficult. Realize that shoeing changes can help with certain conditions but any change must be considered carefully so as to not damage other structures.

Category: Palmar Foot Pain Treatment
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Tildren is a medical option for treating horses as the drug is approved for equine use. Tildren can treat their navicular disease. In navicular disease, the navicular bone is only one of the structures that can lead to lameness in the back of the horse's foot. Consequently, it is important to get an accurate diagnosis before using Tildren because it only is effective in treating bone disease when it inhibits bone resorption. If structures other than the navicular bone are involved and causing pain, Tildren will have no effect and should not be used. To determine which structures are actually causing pain, x-rays, ultrasound, and possibly even an MRI may be required. Once a diagnosis is made and the navicular bone is thought to be involved, Tildren can be used as it inhibits bone resorption, which is considered to occur in some cases of navicular disease. This drug is also used in humans with osteoporosis and is currently being investigated for use in navicular disease. Dr. Britt Conklin indicates in Remuda magazine that Tildren is believed to help with pain by reducing absorption of bone, and some believe it may also have some anti-inflammatory action. The drug's duration of action is weeks to months as it is slowly eliminated from bone. The drug is usually administered intravenously over a period of 30 minutes and a short-term low-calcium concentration can occur in the blood but has not been noted to be a serious problem. Dr. Conklin also indicates that when giving the drug, horses should be held off feed and given an injection of flunixin to help prevent colic.

Category: Physitis in Young Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Physitis is a condition that develops in foals who are between 3 and 6 months of age.  It is an inflammation of the growth plate at the ends of the long bones, and it usually occurs just above the knee, fetlock, or hock.  These areas become swollen and are painful, causing lameness of varying degrees.  The problem is a nutritional one in which growing foals are overfed and are getting too much energy in their diet.  It is common in foals grazing lush pasture or those being fed large amounts of grain to encourage rapid growth.  Diagnosis of the condition is suspected due to clinical signs of swelling above the joints but must be confirmed by X-rays to make sure the foal doesn’t have a fracture. If physitis is diagnosed, a diet analysis is required to make sure the foal is getting the correct amount of energy – enough, but not too much energy.  To reduce energy, some of these foals will need to be weaned if they are nursing mares that produce a lot of milk.  The hay may need to be changed from alfalfa to a good quality grass hay, and it may be necessary to replace high energy concentrates with a ration balancer.  Some breeders may be reluctant to decrease nutrition as they desire a certain size foal for a show or sale.  However, if a foal is lame, shows are not an option anyway. Regardless, we have to do what is best for the horse but we do not want to starve the foals so it is best to place them on a balanced diet with supplemental vitamins and minerals if necessary.  Also, confining these foals is critical as they are in pain and without confinement, these young foals will follow the mare all over the pasture, causing more pain and increasing the inflammation.

Category: Problems in a Recumbent Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English You may see your horse lying down routinely and think lying down is normal for horses, and you would be right assuming the horse only does so for a short period of time. One study found that normal horses lie down during deep sleep for an average of 23 minutes in one study, with the longest period being only one hour. However, horses that are trapped in an emergency such as a barn collapse, or have an illness preventing them from rising, can suffer decreased circulation and muscle inflammation from recumbency within 2 hours. Dr. Tom Gimenez from Clemson indicates in the Equine Veterinarian that after the horse rises and muscle compression is released, a reperfusion injury (damage to tissue when blood supply is restored after some time without sufficient circulation) occurs, and that can cause injured tissue to die. Recumbency also effects the lungs, so the volume of air that is taken in is reduced, which can lead to collapsed lungs and lung congestion. Reperfusion injury can also lead to damage of the lung. The circulation is also decreased with prolonged recumbency, which will lead to increased potassium concentrations that can adversely affect the heart. The damage to muscle cells from prolonged recumbency will cause a release of toxins that can cause severe kidney damage. So whether the horse is trapped by a collapsed barn or down on the ground due to an injury or disease, they must be picked up as soon as possible, preferably within 4 hours, to prevent further injury to organs. Handling a recumbent horse is a major problem. Most referral centers have slings and equipment to get these horses up and help prevent further damage. If you have a horse that is down and will not rise, allowing the horse to remain recumbent for over 7 hours is really not an option if the horse is to survive.

Category: Proximal Suspensory Ligament Injury in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today I am going to talk about inflammation of the proximal suspensory ligament in a horse's hindlimb. This ligament is located at the back of the horse's cannon bone, and it starts at the lower part of the hock and inserts on the sesamoid bones near the fetlock. The ligament starts out as a solid sheet of ligament and then divides into two branches; one branch inserts on the inside sesamoid bones and another on the outside. You cannot really feel the suspensory ligament on the back of the leg because it is close to the bone and under the flexor tendons. All areas of this ligament can be damaged in both the front and hind limbs, but the top portion of the ligament just below the hock in the hind leg is particularly problematic. Until the use of ultrasound, we really had no way of knowing this area was a problem but now with MRIs, damage to this ligament is commonly found. This is a difficult area to ultrasound because it is so deep and it does not always show the damage. It is believed that horses with a straight hock conformation are more susceptible to proximal suspensory ligament injury, and that injury usually occurs with hyperextension of the fetlock joint. Dr. Sue Dyson indicates that a medium to extended trot increases hind limb extension and increases chance of an injury. These horses are usually mildly to moderately lame and a nerve block to numb the area is required to diagnose the condition. Treatment by surgery is the best option, in which the nerve going to the affected area is cut to decrease pain. Some horses with this condition also have lower back pain and pain in the hock joints, and both of these conditions must be treated to make the horse sound.

Category: Rehabilitation of Tendon Injuries in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Tendon injuries are fairly common in performance horses. Rehabilitation of these injuries requires a lot of time and effort for healing to occur.  If your horse has injured a tendon located on the lower legs, it is important for your veterinarian to perform an ultrasound on the tendon as soon as possible.  This initial ultrasound gives your vet an idea of how severe the lesion is, as well as an idea of how long the horse will be unable to perform.  Also, tendon lesions that are bleeding will sometimes heal quicker if the tendon is split with a scalpel to let the blood escape.  An ultrasound exam is required to determine if the tendon will benefit from surgery.  For this reason, it is important to have a baseline ultrasound exam within a day or two of the injury. A lot of these horses with swollen areas around tendons in the lower legs will be lame initially but they may seem fine after resting for 30 days.  However, putting these horses back to work is a big mistake.  Dr. Carol Gillis indicates that any tendon or ligament injury will require at least 6 months of restricted activity to heal.  The tendon must be monitored with an ultrasound every 30 to 60 days to determine if healing is occurring.  All horses with tendon or ligament injuries must be confined for healing to occur.  There is no treatment that will allow a tendon to heal without adequate rest.  These horses need to be confined to a stall but can be hand walked one to three times daily.  If the horse is totally inactive, the injured tendon can shorten and that can predispose the horse to re-injury later on.  So if you have a horse that has injured a tendon, be sure to contact your vet for advice.

Category: Rein Lameness in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Some lameness in horses is not due to pain as some are related to mechanical problems and others are related to nervous system disorders, such as nerve root pain affecting the use of a limb.  Dr. Richard Mansmann indicates in Sporthorsemedicine.com that there is also a condition called rein lameness that is a gait irregularity in which the cause is usually from resistance, not pain.  This condition is best seen and usually only seen when ridden.  The lameness appears as a straight-forward front leg lameness or possibly a mixed front and rear leg lameness; sometime it is called a cat trot.  The gait irregularity is as if the horse is trying to break into a canter from a trot but falls back into a trot while it resists going forward.  When the rider continues, the horse will raise its head as it raises the lead front leg up, making it appear lame.  The horse will then come back to a trot before actually breaking into a canter. Early in the syndrome, other people may ride the horse and the horse will be normal and may be sound on the lone line with no rein pressure.  However, Dr. Mansmann says that as the rider continues to ride the horse, the gait becomes imprinted in the horse’s mind and can be difficult to retrain, especially with that specific rider.  Sometimes there may be a history of pain in the past and now the pain is gone yet the irregular gait continues.  Rein lameness is a difficult diagnosis because the veterinarian has to determine if the horse is in physical pain, if it is a mental issue for the horse, or if is it due to the rider.  A regular lameness exam with nerve blocks, a trial of a pain reliever like bute, and trying other riders are all options to diagnose the condition.  If your horse has an abnormal gait that does not respond to rest, call your veterinarian.

Category: Sacroiliac Pain in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Back pain in horses has always been and still is a difficult diagnosis. Many horses are diagnosed incorrectly with it and treated by chiropractors and acupuncturists and even veterinarians even though the horse probably doesn't even have back pain. Lots of horses get injections in their backs because back pain is difficult to prove. Certainly horses can have back pain but determining for sure which ones do and which ones don't is difficult. And the very low back, or sacroiliac joint, is also difficult to diagnose as a cause of pain. To correctly diagnose the condition, your vet will have to numb or block the joints and then see if the horse is clinically improved. However Dr. Rob Nan Wessum indicated at a recent AAEP meeting that there are several gaits that suggest sacroiliac joint disease. Many horses with sacroiliac disease will track narrow when at a walk or a trot: To avoid rotating the sacrum, the horse places the hind feet closer together than normal when walking, and it appears the horse is walking on a line with each hind foot landing in front of the other. Also, some horses with sacral pain will walk with both limbs advancing at the same time while normally the walk is a four-beat gait and all limbs move at different times. This is especially evident when you walk the horse in a serpentine or zig zag pattern. Another key for sacral pain is when the horse is trotting in a circle, the hind limbs do not follow the front limb and are either in a wider or narrower path. Many of these horses will also hold their tail to the same side when walking and will also bunny hop or move both back legs together when cantering. If your horse has any of these characteristics, ask your vet about sacroiliac pain.

Category: Seasonal Pasture Myopathy in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An unusual but very severe syndrome of muscle damage in horses is called seasonal pasture myopathy.  Myopathy means muscle disease, and seasonal is part of the name because the disease commonly occurs in the fall and is mostly found in the Midwest but does occur in East Texas so i felt you should be aware of the syndrome.  The disease causes severe muscle damage and is fatal is almost 90% of the cases.  Horses appear to be stiff, have difficulty walking and standing, void dark urine, and eventually have difficulty breathing and most do not survive.  And until recently, the cause of the disease was unknown but Dr. Stephanie Valberg at the University of Minnesota found a toxin in the seeds of the box elder tree.  This is the reason for the location of the disease, as box elder is usually a Midwestern tree but it does grow in East Texas. Ingesting box elder seeds results in a breakdown of respiratory, cardiac, and skeletal muscles. Although all horses in the pasture are susceptible, they all do not develop the disease and it is not known why some are susceptible and some are not.  Young horses are more susceptible than older ones, and we don’t know why unless they are more adventurous and eat more of the seeds. Horses turned out in pasture for more than 12 hours a day are more susceptible, especially if they are in a pasture with little grass.  And of course the larger number of box elder trees in the pasture, the greater the likelihood of toxicity.  Regardless, this is a serious disease and if you have box elder trees near your horse pasture, you should consider removing the horses or the trees.

Category: Shivers in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When we think of shivering, we think of a body movement that is performed when we are cold. Certainly many things can cause horses to shiver, including pain or cold. However, the condition of shivers in horses is actually a nerve-related condition that makes it difficult for horses to walk backwards. Dr. Stephanie Valberg is one of the experts in muscle disease in horses and she indicates in the Practitioner that forward walking and trotting are normal in the early stages. Another common finding is it is difficult for the farrier to hold the rear limbs flexed when standing. And many times the horses will hyper-flex the hindlimb when walking backwards and start trembling and then rapidly place the foot on the ground; the term shivers originated with the trembling of the hind limbs. In more severe cases, the horse over-flexes the hind limb and moves the limb out and away from the body in a movement called abduction. Lots of these more severe horses cannot even hold the limb flexed for trimming as they will slam it to the ground. It was thought originally this syndrome was related to polysaccharide storage myopathy and was a muscle disorder but has now been found to be a disorder of the nerves in the area. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for shivers. The symptoms may decrease when the horse is rested but recur when work is started back. Supplementing with vitamin E is recommended, and if the horse has polysaccharide storage myopathy and shivers, feeding a diet low in non-structural carbohydrates and high in fat may be helpful. If you have a horse that gives the farrier a difficult time trimming only the hind legs, shivers could be involved.

Category: Splint Bone Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most of you with horses have heard of the splint bones and may have had horses with inflammation of these bones, which are commonly called splints. The splint bones are two small bones, one on each side of the cannon bone below the knee and hock. The most common reason for inflammation in this area is when young horses are used for athletic activities at too early of an age. The bone can also become inflamed by trauma that commonly occurs from kicking or from interference from another leg when running. Symptoms of splint inflammation, commonly called popping a splint, are pain and swelling around the bones. It is possible that the damage is mild and only involves the ligament that holds the splint bone to the cannon bone. However, in many cases the bone is also involved and can even be fractured if trauma is the cause. For this reason, it is important that all cases of splints be radiographed by your vet to determine the degree of damage. Dr. Nancy Loving from Colorado indicates the most effective initial treatment for splints is to ice the leg with an ice boot for 1 hour 3 to 4 times daily to decrease the inflammatory response. The other initial treatment is anti-inflammatories such as phenylbutazone, keeping a pressure wrap on the leg, and maybe the most important treatment of all is rest. After a couple of weeks, a sweat wrap can be applied to heat the leg and improve circulation. After 3 to 4 weeks you can begin hand walking and after 6 to 8 weeks the horse can begin gradual work in mild cases. More severe cases and fractures require longer rest and some fractures can require surgery. Some horses will require 3 to 6 months before getting back to full work.

Category: Splint Bone Fractures in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have horses, you have probably heard of the splint bone or splints but may not know where the bones are located or what problems can develop with them.  The splint bones are on the inside and outside of the horse’s front and rear legs.  These small, long and thin bones begin at the bottom of the knees and hocks and extend almost to the fetlocks.  One problem that can happen with these bones usually occurs in young horses when they begin training.  Sometimes hard training can cause the bones to develop inflammation at the sites of attachment to the large bones between the knee and fetlock. This is the condition called splints.  Inflammation at these attachment areas can cause swelling, lameness, and pain and most of the time rest is a successful treatment. The other common problem with these bones is fractures that are usually caused by traumatic injuries such as kicks from other horses.  Some of these fractures can be mild and heal without any treatment while others require major surgery.  A recent paper out of Switzerland in Equine Veterinary Education indicated that for the top portion of the splint bone, the bone on the outside of the leg was mostly involved and generally these fractures were open and contaminated.  Surprisingly, most of the horses in this study were treated without surgery.  However, if the bone is unstable, a steel plate may be required on the bone to allow healing.  Fractures of the middle and lower portion of the bone that are displaced must be treated surgically or removed.  A common problem with these injuries is the suspensory ligament is adjacent to these bones and injury to this structure can also occur.

Category: Stem Cell Treatments in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Over the last several years, stem cells have been advocated in horses for use in arthritic joints as well as injection in damaged tendons and ligaments to aid in healing. There are several companies that have developed methods of harvesting stem cells from all different sources and all of these companies report that their method is the best. The reality is there is little scientific proof concerning the success of stem cells or which of the many different methods is the most effective. Because of this reality, I am going to share some information about stem cells in general from the International Society for Stem Cell Research. First of all, all the different stem cells are tissue specific, meaning a stem cell from brain tissue can make brain cells but not bone or tendon cells. The society recommends being wary of clinics treating tissues with stem cells that come from another part of the body that is different from the area you are treating. Also, it is unlikely that a stem cell from a specific type tissue would be able to treat multiple different diseases. The best defined stem cell treatments are blood stem cells that have been used to treat diseases of the blood system as well as well as bone, skin, and eye diseases that have been treated with stem cells from these specific organs. You may talk with people who say their horse was treated with stem cells and responded well and this may be the case. However, without controlled scientific studies, it is impossible to know how the tissue might have healed without the stem cell treatment. So although stem cell therapy may be effective in certain conditions, be sure and do your research before spending the money for stem cell treatment in your horse.

Category: Subsolar Bruising in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A problem we see in our practice quite frequently is a horse with a bruised sole.  There are many causes of bruising including using a horse on hard or rocky ground that has soft soles.  Also, some horses can be shod incorrectly and a shoe can pinch the sole and cause pressure or the horse can be trimmed too short and cause bruising.  The sole is not designed to support weight and flat-footed horses are prone to chronic bruising.  Some horses also have thin soles, and these horses are susceptible to bruising when used on hard ground. For many years treatment of subsolar bruising has involved soaking the foot to supposedly draw out or relieve inflammation.  However, Dr Steve O’Grady, an equine podiatrist, indicates that soaking the foot for more than 2 to 3 days can actually worsen the problem by softening the sole and decreasing the its protection.  Foot bruising is commonly seen in show horses that are bathed continually as the excessive moisture weakens the hoof wall.  As the wall weakens, cracks develop and the sole gets closer to the ground and increases the chance of bruising. Dr. O’Grady mentions that the treatment for bruising should be just the opposite.  Instead of softening the sole with soaking, we should instead try to toughen the sole for protection.  The horse should be placed in a dry stall to promote drying of the sole and a product designed to toughen the sole such as formalin and iodine mixtures can be used topically.  Some of these deep bruises take a long time to heal but these bruised areas should not be opened with a hoof knife like an abscess, as this will only cause further pain and delay healing.

Category: Suspensory Ligament Injuries in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Suspensory ligament injuries can cause severe problems in performance horses and today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about some new techniques being used to treat this disease. The suspensory ligament stretches from the top of the back of the cannon bone all the way to the bottom of the bone and inserts on the sesamoid bones at the fetlock. The suspensory is a ligament, and ligaments heal slower than other tissues and they heal with scar tissue that is weaker than the normal tissue. Many times rest and rehabilitation do not help these injuries to heal. It is reported that only 20-40% of horses with suspensory ligament injuries of the hind legs will be able to return to work at the preinjury level. The vets at Washington State have been doing research to develop a treatment to help these ligaments heal better and quicker. The group of vets is using a technique called a fasciotomy that was developed in England. It includes removing an area of the nerve that innervates a portion of the ligament and also cutting the tissue that surrounds the ligament to reduce pressure. The group in England has achieved a high success rate with this procedure. Also the vets at WSU are injecting stem cells into the ligament. Bone marrow stem cells are believed to stimulate natural ligament regeneration so after repair the tissue will closely resemble normal tissue. Stem cells are removed from the horse's bone marrow, cultured for 2 to 3 weeks, and then injected into the affected area of the ligament. Horses either injure the ligament slowly with the development of small tears or develop an acute tear all at once when performing a maneuver.

Category: Tendon Injury Treatments for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Tendon injuries are common in horses.  Tendons attach muscle to bone and are susceptible to injury. Dr. Sherry Johnson reports in The Horse that injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon is the primary reason for retiring thoroughbred racehorses.  The initial tendon injury leads to pain, lameness and a long rehab period but reinjury rates can be as high as 82%, which eventually leads to retirement.  Because of this, tendon healing strategies and equine rehab are important in getting these horses healed and back to doing their job. Tendon injuries commonly cause heat, pain and swelling depending on the tendon. This is usually obvious depending on the tendon’s location.  Dr. Johnson says the tendon repair process has three phases and the initial inflammatory phase occurs during the first three days.  During this phase, icing of the tendon, rest and anti-inflammatories are recommended.  After three days, the repair process occurs and lasts about 28 days, and then remodeling and scar tissue formation begins and lasts up to 60 days post injury. There are multiple options in treating tendon injuries and using stem cells in the tendon is one option that helps to decrease the reinjury rate.  However, controlled exercise and physical therapy still seem to be the most important treatments.  Eccentric loading exercises have been shown to be effective and involve lengthening the muscle or tendon fibers during load bearing.  An example of an eccentric loading exercise is the withers pull, which involves applying gentle pressure to the side of the withers until the horse shifts their weight and you hold that for five seconds.  Your veterinarian can prescribe other types of physical therapy for tendon injuries.

Category: Tendonitis Treatment in Horses with Urinary Bladder Matrix
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Tendonitis is a common problem in performance horses and there are multiple recommended treatments for the condition including ice and rest, injections into the tendons, and even surgery. Tendonitis is due to strain on the tendon, and after the strength of the tendon is overcome, physical disruption occurs. One of the most common areas of tendonitis in horses is the superficial digital flexor tendon that is located at the back of the horse's lower leg, just above the fetlock. When tendons heal, the tendon with scar tissue is just like all other tissues, and scar tissue is not as strong or as effective in doing the tendon's job as normal tendon tissue. Because of this, if a treatment could cause more normal tissue to develop rather than a scar, it would be beneficial. One product developed to attempt to treat tendonitis is a powder that is derived from the urinary bladder of pigs called urinary bladder matrix or UBM. This product is thought to recruit regenerative cells into injured tissue to help tissue regenerate into normal tissue. To determine if this product did help tendons heal, a study was performed at Colorado State University in which horses with experimentally-induced tendonitis were injected in the tendons with UBM and a control of saline. In this study, UBM did not seem to be any more effective at tendon healing than saline. However, experimentally-induced tendonitis may not heal the same as naturally-occurring tendonitis and the dosage of UBM used was less than recommended by the manufacturer. It is difficult to test a product on natural tendon injuries because none are the same and it is difficult to judge the response, so further studies are needed.

Category: Treating Clubfoot in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Club foot occurs in horses when the coffin joint at the hoof is in a partially flexed position and cannot be extended correctly. When you look at the front of a horse’s hoof with a club foot, the hoof wall will be straighter and more vertical than normal. The condition can occur immediately after birth or can develop at any age. Horses with a club foot have a hoof angle that is greater than 60 degrees while normal horses have a hoof angle of around 50 degrees. There are different grades of club foot, and some horses have a hoof angle greater than 90 degrees. The cause is shortening of the deep digital flexor muscle and tendon on the back side of the horse’s leg, which prevents the coffin joint from being extended. In severe cases, damage to the coffin bone in the hoof can occur and horses commonly develop bruising at the toe and as well as recurrent abscesses in the sole. Foals born with a club foot will generally resolve as they begin to exercise, although some will require bandaging or splinting of the leg. Treatment of older horses requires trimming the toe as short as possible to aid in breakover and gradually lowering the heel every two to four weeks to stretch the deep digital flexor muscle. In some cases with younger horses, you can expect the muscle to stretch and the heel can be trimmed to a normal position. However, in an older horse or one for which trimming cannot be performed enough to correct the hoof angle, surgery will be required. Surgery involves cutting the accessory ligament of the deep flexor tendon, which allows the tendon to stretch. If you have a horse with a club foot, call your vet for an exam as early treatment can sometimes avoid surgery.

Category: Tying up in Quarter Horses and Other Breeds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have horses, you have probably heard of tying up. There are really three types of tying up. The first can be due to overexertion in horses that are not in good enough physical shape to undergo the exercise they are asked to perform. It can also be due to heat exhaustion or electrolyte imbalances. These horses have an increased respiratory rate, elevated temperature, sweating, muscle stiffness, and shifting lameness in the hind legs. After treatment the syndrome does not recur if the horse is not over exercised again unless the horse has one of the two other types of tying up. The second type, recurrent tying up in thoroughbreds and in some Standardbreds, is due to a genetic muscle defect that leads to abnormal calcium regulation. The third type is also recurrent but is common in quarter horses, draft horses, and other breeds that is due to a defect in storing the compound glycogen in the muscle; it’s called polysaccharide storage myopathy or PSSM. This is also a genetic defect, and symptoms may be very mild with only intermittent lameness or poor performance. Because it is a genetic problem, there is a blood test or hair test that can be performed on many of the affected horses to diagnose PSSM. If the blood or hair test is negative but it is still believed to be PSSM, a muscle biopsy is required to make the diagnosis. In general, preventing this disease is effective with a diet change to a low-starch high-fat feed. So if you have a horse that ties up, just realize that it can be a complicated issue depending on the breed and circumstances, and that treatment requires an accurate diagnosis to determine the type of tying up.

Category: Upward Fixation of the Patella is Common in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An upward fixation of the patella is a condition in which the horse’s patella, or kneecap, is caught or trapped on the bottom portion of the horse’s femur just above the stifle joint; this prevents the horse from flexing the leg.  You may have heard some people say the affected horse is stifled, but the correct term is upward fixation of the patella.  The condition can be found in any breed of horse but commonly occurs in ponies and miniature horses and is due to the horse’s anatomy.  It commonly occurs in horses with straight hind limbs and those with poor muscling that allows the patella to be more mobile; the patella gets trapped on the femur and will not release.  It is also commonly seen in horses that are not exercised because muscle tone decreases. Many years ago, the condition was treated surgically.  One of the patellar ligaments was cut and although this was effective, complications did develop.  It was found that after this surgery, damage to the kneecap itself could occur so the surgery was not as popular. However, we now believe the kneecap damage can be prevented by resting the horse for 8 weeks after surgery.  Other treatments include injecting the ligaments with various substances to inflame them and make them thicker, which prevents the kneecap from getting caught on the femur.  Another surgery reported on several years ago was splitting the patellar ligament with a blade rather than completely cutting it.  In this procedure, stab incisions are made in the ligament to cause it to thicken versus cutting it entirely. A recent study conducted by surgeons in Copenhagen found that over 97% of the horses in their study responded to this surgery with no post-operative complications.

Category: Using Bisphosphonates to Treat Navicular Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Navicular disease is a common problem in performance horses.  Dr. Steven Colburn from Escondido, California, indicated in the Texas Equine Vet Association Publication the Remuda that he previously treated all navicular cases with therapeutic shoeing, isoxuprine and aspirin and then if they did not respond, he would inject the coffin joint with medication.  However, he now uses osphos and says that up to 70% of his patients have improved. Western performance horses commonly have navicular pain but other event horses can have the condition as well.  It is important for your vet to perform a complete exam with X-rays and blocking the feet to make sure of the diagnosis.  In some cases, an MRI is required to make the diagnosis because navicular disease, now called heel pain, can affect structures other than the navicular bone, such as ligaments around the bone.  However, if X-rays indicate the bone is involved, Dr. Colburn treats the horse with osphos, which is a bisphosphonate; those inhibit bone resorption, which decreases loss of bone as bone loss is one thing that occurs in horses with navicular disease.  Dr. Colburn recommends light work after the injection and you will need to stop using NSAIDs such as bute at the same time as both drugs can affect the kidneys.  Some horses can develop colic after the injection, but it is usually mild and walking the horse after the injection can usually decrease symptoms.  Rare signs after osphos injection include a decreased appetite, lethargy, and injection site reactions.  The safe use of osphos has not been studied in horses less than 4 years old and should also not be used in pregnant horses, lactating mares, or those used for breeding.  If you have a horse diagnosed with navicular disease, ask your vet about osphos.

Category: Using Prednisolone in Horses with Laminitis and Founder
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many horses have flying insect allergies and other allergies as well as respiratory disease, such as equine asthma, that require steroids like prednisolone to control their symptoms.  However, many of these horses also have laminitis or founder or may be overweight, have equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing’s disease, making them susceptible to laminitis and founder. In these horses, steroids have been reported to increase the chance of laminitis and founder developing, and yet allergic conditions in many cases require their use. To determine the safety of using oral prednisolone in these horses, a British study was done over a 13-year period; 416 horses that received prednisolone were compared to 814 control horses that hadn’t.  The median age of the horses was 13 and no significant differences between breeds and sexes were noted.  The laminitis rate was calculated and there was no significant difference between prednisolone-treated and non-treated groups in overall incidence of laminitis.  There were 62 total cases of laminitis with an incidence of 3.5% of the horses not treated with prednisolone and 2.5% of those treated with prednisolone, but about 50% of the horses treated with prednisolone developed laminitis while on the drug.  Also, 50% of the horses that developed laminitis on the drug also have equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing’s disease.  So, it appears from the study that prednisolone did not increase the risk of laminitis.  However, I believe one should still be cautious using it in horses with equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing’s disease unless absolutely necessary and then understand there may be a risk with its use.

Category: X-rays Can Help while Trimming Horse's Hooves
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Other than wild horses, most domestic horses need their feet trimmed every 6 to 8 weeks depending on their use and environment. Wild horses that walk many miles per day to graze usually wear their hooves down and do not require trimming. Domestic horses spend most of their time standing around and consequently require trimming. Most trained farriers can do a good job at trimming the feet of most horses unless other conditions develop, such as founder or navicular disease. In these instances, x-rays can be extremely helpful in trimming the foot because you can determine the bone's location. Many horses also have low heels and long toes, and solving this problem can be greatly aided by using x-rays to determine where the bone is. Regardless of your farrier's experience, they cannot see inside the horse's hoof to know how much they can trim the toe without causing damage to the foot and possible lameness. Owners report that many of their horses trip from time to time when galloping, and often the tripping is related to angles of the feet and long toes. By using x-rays and working with a farrier, the toes can be trimmed back as far as possible, and if necessary, the hoof can be realigned to change the hoof angle. Many times this is all that is required to help these horses perform better. X-rays are critical for horses that have foundered; foundered horses cannot be correctly trimmed without x-rays because the bone in the hoof has changed position and the farrier cannot determine its location. These hooves must be realigned and that is impossible without x-rays. There are several other conditions in which using x-rays of the hoof can really help your farrier do a better job and help your horse's performance improve.

Category: Antibiotic Use in Horse Reproduction
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most common causes of infertility in mares is an infection in the uterus. However, many mares are treated for infections even though they might not actually be infected. Just because a culture of the uterus reveals an infectious organism does not mean this organism is a real pathogen causing a problem. Consequently, it is important to also look at the uterine cells under a microscope to make sure there is actual inflammation and the mare really is infected. For uterine infections, it is common to infuse antibiotics in the uterus; this is the method that has been used for many years for treatment. However, it is important to know that a lot of these mares have material in their uterus that will inactivate the antibiotics, so it is always a good idea to flush the uterus with large volumes of sterile solutions before infusing. Most mares need antibiotics infused in the uterus for 3 to 7 days, depending on the infection. Also, systemic use of antibiotics has been shown to reach high concentrations in the uterus and can be effective for treating uterine infections. Systemic antibiotic treatment means that you are giving antibiotics orally or by injection rather than placing them directly in the uterus. The advantage of treating with systemic antibiotics is you do not have to physically enter the uterus daily and potentially contaminant the uterus. A disadvantage is that a longer treatment period is required and only certain antibiotics are effective. If the uterine infection is due to an anatomic abnormality of the genital area, no infection will be cured long term until the abnormality is surgically repaired.

Category: Artificial Insemination Techniques for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Artificial insemination, or AI, has been performed in horses since the end of the 18th century but embryo transfer in horses has lagged behind other species, especially cattle. Initially, difficulties in transporting equine semen restricted use of AI to the premises where the semen was collected. However, improvements in technology have allowed AI using cold and frozen semen to become common in today's horse industry. When natural breeding was compared to AI, there was no difference in pregnancy rates when breeding fertile mares, so breeding mares by AI is very effective. However, in AI breeding the timing near ovulation is critical and extremely critical when using frozen semen. In fact, frozen semen is also placed deep in the uterine horn of the mare adjacent to the follicle that is going to ovulate because this increases pregnancy rate. Embryo transfer allows a breeder to obtain more than one foal from a valuable mare per year. Although cattle are superovulated to produce multiple ova for breeding, Dr. Jacob Scherzer indicates in the Compendium that this process has not been as successful in horses as in cattle. Superovulation has been shown to produce on average almost two embryos from these mares whereas mares without superovulation produce about one half of an embryo per mare. Consequently, mares used in embryo transfer are four times more likely to produce an embryo than if they are not superovulated. For embryo transfer, the mare's uterus is flushed with a sterile fluid and embryos are recovered and then either transported directly into a recipient mare or can be frozen for later implantation. For more information on embryo transfer in horses or AI, contact your equine veterinarian.

Category: Blue Light Masks Help Brood Mares Cycle Early
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Mares are seasonally polyestrus, meaning they come into heat multiple times a year but only at certain times of the year. For mares in the northern hemisphere, those are times with increased day length as they normally only cycle from March to October. But since the birthdate of many horse breeds is artificially set at January 1 for aging purposes, the earlier in the year the foal is born, the better for showing and performance. So the goal is to get a mare to come into heat and get pregnant as early in the year as possible so the foal will be born as close to the first of the year as possible. It is difficult for a two-year old horse born in May to compete with a two-year old born in February because that three months makes a lot of difference in maturity, size and athletic ability at that age. The best method to get these mares to cycle early is to expose them to light throughout the winter and trick their hormonal system into thinking the days are actually longer than they really are. So beginning December 1, most brood mares are placed in the barn at dusk and the lights in the barn are turned on so the mares will get 16 hours light per day during the winter and be ready to cycle in the spring. And although this is effective, it means you have to stall mares longer than normal, which means extra labor. Also, stalled horses tend to colic more than horses at pasture and most horses are generally happier at pasture. Dr. Barbara Murphy from Ireland has developed a face mask for the horse to wear that provides a short wavelength of blue light that mimics sunlight, so the horse can get extra light needed for cycling but can remain in the pasture. If you have brood mares that you want to get pregnant early but do not want to stall them, ask your vet about this blue light-producing face mask.

Category: Breeding the Older Maiden Mare
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Every breeding season we have a few mare owners that want to breed older maiden mares. A maiden mare is a mare that has never had a foal. These mares may have been busy performing for the first part of their life and now the owners would like to get a foal. Many owners feel this should not be a problem because the mares should be just like young maiden mares and not have any uterine pathology. However, Dr. Jonathon Pycock indicates that there is a good possibility that older maiden mares may have difficulty conceiving. Even though these mares have not been bred, aging changes still occur such as glandular degeneration and endometriosis. Also, many of these older maiden mares have excessive uterine fluid and excessive uterine fluid has been shown to be a cause of reduced fertility. One cause of excessive uterine fluid is a tight cervix that is unable to dilate properly and prevents normal uterine drainage. These mares generally have no signs of inflammation in the uterus but fail to get pregnant and accumulate fluid in the uterus. If there is more than 1 cm of fluid in the uterus during heat, oxytocin should be used to get rid of this fluid. If there is greater than 2 cm of fluid seen on ultrasound, the uterus may need to be drained and flushed. If there is significant uterine fluid 18 hours after breeding, then the mare can be considered to have delayed uterine clearance. Along with oxytocin and uterine flushing, a prostaglandin such as cloprostenol can be used to decrease the volume of uterine fluid. Cloprostenol actually lasts longer than oxytocin but Dr. Pycock indicates it should not be used after breeding. If you have a maiden mare that has not gotten pregnant, consult your vet for an exam.

Category: Breeding-Induced Endometritis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have open brood mares at this time of year, then something occurred that prevented them from becoming pregnant. The most common cause of infertility mares is endometritis or inflammation of the uterus. When most people think of endometritis, they think of infection, and certainly infection can cause endometritis. However, a condition called breeding-induced endometritis can also lead to infertility in mares. The uterus has a normal inflammatory response to breeding that is necessary to remove contaminating bacteria and excess semen and seminal fluid from the uterus. In a healthy uterus, this inflammation subsides in 48 hours. However, in some mares the inflammation does not subside but continues through days 5-6 when the embryo drops from the fallopian tubes into the uterus. This persistent mating-induced endometritis is fairly common in older mares. If inflammation is in the uterus when the embryo arrives on days 5-6, the embryo will not be able to implant and pregnancy will not occur. Diagnosis of the condition is by exam of cells from the inside of the uterus, the lack of infection, and increased fluid in the uterus. As far as treatment, many vets use antibiotics but antibiotics are really not indicated since there is no infection in most cases. Flushing the uterus and using medications to clear the uterine fluid usually clears any bacteria introduced into the uterus during breeding. Some mares with persistent mating-induced metritis have responded to treatment with cortisone to reduce inflammation. Also, some mares have responded to medication to stimulate immunity but the most important thing to realize is that if a mare does not have an infection but is still infertile, persistent mating induced metritis could be the problem.

Category: Complications of Equine Castration
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although equine castration is a common procedure, it is not without complications in some cases.  Equine veterinarians castrate hundreds of horses over their careers and most do very well.  However, complications can occur and the first one is bleeding.  In most cases, the castration incision is left open to drain and most of the incisions will bleed a small amount at the time of surgery and may have some blood dripping for 1-2 days.  However, the vessels to the testicles are large and if these vessels are not treated correctly, significant hemorrhage can occur and can even lead to the horse’s death.  The vessels are either crimped, twisted, or ligated (tied) with suture to prevent bleeding and some horses — and especially donkeys — tend to bleed more than others.  Ligating the vessels with suture is the best option but can result in chronic infection called a scirrhous cord, which will require more surgery so most vets do not like using suture.  If bleeding does occur, it can be a real problem as the vessels retract up into the abdominal cavity and cannot be ligated if bleeding continues unless the horse can be taken to a referral center for major abdominal surgery. The next concern is an inguinal hernia in which case the intestines can come out of the abdominal cavity through the castration incision.  Some horses have a large inguinal ring and through no fault of the vet, part of the intestine can enter the inguinal canal and exit the skin.  This can be a deadly complication unless treated aggressively and immediately.  Lastly, an infection at the incision can occur and this is usually due to flies contaminating the open wound so I do not like castrating horses in the summer and recommend doing this procedure in colder weather when there are less fly problems.

Category: Cryptorchid Stallions
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Castration is the most common surgery performed on horses and although it';s common, it is not without potential complications. Because it is so commonly performed, many people have the mistaken impression that it is no big deal. The surgery itself it not a big deal as long as both testicles are descended but if one or both testicles have not descended into the abdomen, the castration is much more difficult and in most cases should not be performed in the field but in a hospital under sterile conditions. Also, many horses are still castrated by non-veterinarians without the use of anesthesia and this is ridiculous in today's world. Veterinarian's fees for equine castrations are very low and if you can afford to raise and own a horse, you can certainly afford for them to be castrated humanely under anesthesia by a veterinarian. Castration complications include swelling, infection, excessive bleeding, and herniation of the intestine through the incision. The most common complication is swelling that prevents adequate drainage of the surgical incision, which is followed by infection. Treatment usually involves increased exercise and sometimes the veterinarian must reopen the incision to allow drainage. The most serious complication is intestinal herniation through the incision because unless the veterinarian is there to immediately replace the intestine, most of these horses will not survive. These hernias can occur several hours after the procedure, so all castrated horses should be monitored closely immediately after the surgery. Castration is a serious surgery and should be performed only by a veterinarian under heavy sedation or anesthesia. Proper exercise and post operative care is critical to avoid complications.

Category: Cryptorchid Testicle Descent in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Cryptorchidism is a condition in which one or both testicles are not located in the scrotum.  Dr. Bill Pickett from Colorado State indicates in the Horse magazine that in a normal colt, testicles are initially in the abdominal cavity, and then between 30 days before birth to 10 days after birth they should descend through the inguinal canal and into the scrotum.  However, sometimes the testicle does not descend, a condition called cryptorchidism.  There are multiple theories as to the cause of cryptorchidism but regardless, if the testicle is in the inguinal canal, there are some hormone treatments that have been reported to be effective at causing the testicle to enter the scrotum.  However, if the testicle is in the abdomen it will not descend regardless of treatment and will require surgical removal. So, if the testicle is in the inguinal canal, hormonal therapy can be tried and Dr. Steven Conboy from Kentucky indicates if he has a stallion that has an undescended testicle at 12 months of age, he will administer an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin twice weekly for four to six weeks.  He reports that on a standardbred farm, this process was effective in 58 percent of the colts at allowing descension of the testicle, while only six percent descended without the drug.  Another drug used, GNRH, is reported to have a similar effect. The real question is if these injections are effective, should a cryptorchid horse be used for breeding?  Although most veterinarians believe the condition is hereditary, this has not been scientifically proven to be the case.  Research is being performed by gene mapping to further clarify the issue but at this time, it is really up to individual horse owners to determine if they want to breed a stallion that was born as a cryptorchid.

Category: Necrotic Vaginitis in Horses and Donkeys
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on the program I am going to discuss a condition that can occur in mares after foaling called necrotic vaginitis. This condition is common in miniature horses but can occur in all horses and donkeys. It is caused by trauma to the vaginal canal during the foaling process. Although this trauma can occur in an apparently normal foaling, it more commonly occurs in maiden mares and in cases that require manipulation of the fetus by a veterinarian to aid the foal's birth. Any mare that has a difficult time having a foal should be examined after foaling by a veterinarian. In fact, it is always a good idea for your veterinarian to check your mare at 12 hours after foaling by gently parting the vulvar lips and looking for bruising. If the area appears bruised, then a speculum exam is indicated. Symptoms of necrotic vaginitis include depression, lethargy, inappetence, and some mares will dribble urine due to the trauma around the urethral opening. Diagnosis of the condition is fairly easy as a speculum exam reveals red inflamed areas on the vaginal walls that become blue and black as the tissue dies. A lot of the vaginal tissue will die and slough, and antibiotics should be used during this time to prevent infection. A major concern in miniature horses with this syndrome is that adhesions can develop between the vaginal walls, which can lead to permanent damage. To prevent adhesions, while using a sterile glove an antibiotic steroid cream must be applied inside the vagina at least twice weekly until the lesions heal. So if you have a mare that has any trouble foaling, especially a miniature mare, be sure and have your veterinarian perform a vaginal exam after foaling.

Category: Placentitis in Mares
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Placentitis is a term used to describe infection of the fetal membranes and is a fairly common cause of abortion in pregnant mares. Most cases of placentitis are caused by bacteria that have ascended from the mare's vulvar area up to and through the cervix. For this reason, susceptible mares should have a Caslick's surgery after breeding as this surgery partially closes the vulva and helps prevent fecal contamination that could lead to placentitis. To prevent abortion, early detection of the condition is critical and waiting until clinical signs of placentitis develop may be too late. Mares with placentitis may develop premature udder development or a vaginal discharge but by this time, treatment is more difficult. For this reason, mares with a history of pregnancy loss or uterine infections should be checked early for placentitis. Placentitis can be detected by an ultrasound exam of the placenta and measuring the thickness of the placenta. Abnormal thickness compared to normal measurements has been shown to indicate placentitis. Also, sometimes your vet can see a separation of the placenta from the uterus and can even see infected material. Studies have shown that treatment with an oral antibacterial called trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, plus a drug called pentoxifylline, plus a double dose of Regumate has been shown to be effective in preventing abortion in some cases. However, it is important to check mares early to be successful in this treatment so it is recommended to start checking mares by ultrasound for placentitis at 8 to 9 months of pregnancy.

Category: Retained Placenta in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A retained placenta in a mare is a serious problem that can lead to death.This condition is much differentin horsesthan incattle because although a problem can develop in cattle with a retained placenta, it is generally much less critical. In horses, the entire placenta should be passed in 3 hours and any portion of the placenta remaining after this time is considered retained. If any portion is retained, you should not adopt a wait and see approach but should call your veterinarian immediately. It is important for the horse owner to realize that this is an emergency situation, and tonever pull on the placenta by hand. If the placenta is dragging the ground, it is okay to tie a knot in it so the mare will not step on it, but you do not want to cut it off as the weight of the placenta will hopefully lead to expulsion. If the placenta has only been retained for a few hours, many times multiple injections of oxytocin can cause the placenta to drop without further treatment. If this is not effective, your vet will generally flush the uterus to encourage removal and flush out material that can lead to infection. If the placenta is retained for longer than 8 hours, a painful foot condition called laminitis can occur. Prevention of laminitis involves icing the mare's feet continually for up to 3 days and using anti-inflammatories as well as other treatments. Icing the feet continually is not an easy job but it has been shown to be effective. The important point hereis that if your mare has a retained placenta, call your veterinarian immediately as there is a risk of losing your mare without aggressive treatment.

Category: Septic Metritis in Mares
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Probably the most common condition that affects mares after foaling is septic metritis, which is an infection in the uterus. These uterine infections can affect the mare's health and can even lead to death if not treated immediately. Many times mares develop an infection after a difficult birth or if the mare fails to pass the afterbirth. If the afterbirth is not passed after 3 hours, it is considered to be retained and the condition should be treated. However, removing the placenta by hand is not recommended as the mare's uterus is very sensitive and removing the placenta can cause severe uterine damage and can even tear the uterus. A retained placenta in a mare is a reason to call your veterinarian. Most of the time, the placenta can be expelled with injections of oxytocin or flushing the uterus with sterile fluids. Mares that have had retained placentas are susceptible to laminitis or founder but if the uterus is flushed well and infection is prevented, the chance of laminitis is decreased. If a mare develops a discharge after foaling and also develops a uterine infection, then the chance of laminitis is greater and it is critical that the mare be examined. These infections can cause the mares to be toxic, and these toxins can lead to death. Generally, antibiotics are indicated as well as large volume flushes of the uterus; sometimes keeping these mares on soft sand may help to prevent laminitis. Another possible prevention for laminitis is to ice the horse's feet 24 hours a day for 2 to 3 days. However, removing the infected fluid from the uterus is critical. If you have a mare that retained her placenta or had a difficult birth, call your veterinarian to examine her and make sure she is okay.

Category: Bleeding in the Lungs of Endurance Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Bleeding in the airways of racehorses is common as 90% of horses have some evidence of bleeding after racing.  This bleeding, called exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or EIPH, has been shown to cause a significant decrease in racehorse performance, depending on the amount of bleeding that occurs. Veterinarians thought for years that other performance horses may also be bleeding in the airways, so a Spanish study tried to determine the percentage of EIPH in competing endurance horses.  The study tested 20 endurance horses and found that 65% had some evidence of bleeding either 3-8 or 36-38 days after competing. It was unusual to find evidence of bleeding 30 days after an event, but this was found in 50% of the horses tested.  These samples were collected by passing a scope into the trachea and looking at the trachea and taking samples.  Both techniques are important for the diagnosis. Looking in the trachea for frank blood and the amount of blood can help determine the severity of the bleed, and taking samples and examining cells can detect smaller amounts of bleeding.  The question the study did not answer concerns the possible decrease in performance of these endurance horses due to bleeding.  We know that racehorses with moderate to severe EIPH have a significant decrease in racing times and are not very successful as racehorses.  And racehorses that bleed are routinely given the diuretic furosemide to prevent bleeding.  However, this is not recommended in endurance horses because dehydration is a concern in these horses even without using a diuretic so there is no treatment available at this time to prevent airway bleeding in these endurance horses.

Category: Complications Using Glass Balls to Suppress a Mare's Estrus
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Mares begin cycling in spring as most do not cycle in the winter. And if you have a mare that acts crazy and has behavior problems when in heat, you may be looking for some help. Some of these mares are so severely affected that they cannot even be ridden when in heat and many of them do not perform up to their potential. There are several things that can be done to suppress heat. One of these things that has been common is to insert a sterile glass ball or marble in the mare’s uterus. The glass ball or marble is believed to simulate a pregnancy and keep the mare from cycling. This technique was studied and published. I have used the procedure and it seemed to be effective in about 50% of the mares into whom I inserted a marble. However, a recent report indicates using these marbles may be dangerous and one report indicated the mare developed a severe infection, while in another report two glass balls were used and they broke apart and the glass became embedded in the uterus. Whether this was related to using two balls, which was not tested in the original research, or just something that happened, we don’t know. However, I think it is enough of a concern that I will be reluctant to use glass marbles in the future. The most common method used to prevent heat in mares is to give a commercial hormone or progestin that must be given daily and is expensive. There is a compounded long-acting product that is effective in preventing heat. The newest technique is to use oxytocin to keep mares from cycling. If you have a mare with behavior problems when she is in heat, ask your vet for help.

Category: Diagnosing Asthma in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A new test is being developed to diagnose equine asthma in horses.  The term equine asthma has only been used for a few years but the disease has been around for many years.  In the past it was called heaves, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, and recurrent airway obstruction or RAO.  I am not sure why the names of diseases keep changing, but supposedly it is to better describe the condition.  Regardless, if you have heard of heaves or COPD in horses, then asthma is the same condition.  Dr. Stacey Oke indicates in The Horse magazine that symptoms of asthma in horses can be mild or severe, like asthma in people, and severe symptoms in horses involve an increased respiratory rate and rhythm at rest plus a cough.  Horses with mild asthma might just have decreased performance, while those with moderate disease may cough and have other respiratory signs that could be misdiagnosed as an infection.  To accurately diagnose the condition, a bronchoalveolar lavage is required in which your veterinarian will place a small tube in the sedated horse’s lung, introduce some sterile saline, and then remove the fluid for analysis. However, Dr. Jean-Pierre Lavoie From Canada says there may be an easier method by using biomarkers circulating in the blood to identify asthma.  The researchers have identified three different biomarkers and found that the presence of these biomarkers effectively can determine all horses without the disease, but only can determine 57% of those that actually have it.  Still, ruling out 100% of the horses that do not have the disease is important in the diagnosis as the veterinarian at least knows the problem is not asthma.  Treating for asthma can cause increased disease if the horse has an infection, not asthma.

Category: Guttural Pouch Infections in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A structure in the horse’s respiratory system called the guttural pouch is unique to equine animals and a few other species. It is a pouch or pocket off of the respiratory tract in the horse’s throat area, adjacent to the Eustachian tube. Some people believe the function of these guttural pouches is to allow the arteries that carry blood to the brain to be cooled during intensive exercise because the pouch is lined by a thin membrane that covers the internal carotid artery. These pouches contain major arteries and nerves. Multiple diseases can occur in the guttural pouch. The most common is a secondary infection after a strangles infection, which is bacterial. The pouch can fill with infectious material and the horse can continue to spread the infection to other horses even after the horse has no clinical signs. Treatment requires flushing the guttural pouch and packing it with antibiotics. Another concern with the guttural pouch is a fungal infection called guttural pouch mycosis. Dr. Nathan Slovis indicates this infection can be a life-threatening disease as the internal carotid artery that I mentioned is only covered by a thin membrane. If the fungus destroys the membrane and artery, severe and even deadly bleeding can occur. The fungus can also affect some of the cranial nerves in the area and can lead to difficulty eating and swallowing. Treatment for the fungal infection usually requires surgery as treating this particular infection with antifungal medications are usually not effective. The best treatment is surgery in which a balloon is inserted in the artery to block the blood supply to the fungus. Without a blood supply, the fungus will die. So if your horse has a nasal discharge, especially if it is bloody, call your vet for an exam of the guttural pouches The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Respiratory vs. Nervous System Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most serious infectious diseases we see in horses is the neurological form of the herpes virus. It can affect the respiratory tract and generally causes mild disease. But when it affects the neurological system it can be deadly. Researchers at Michigan State found that young horses generally develop respiratory disease, while older horses usually develop the neurological form of the disease because of different immune responses. At the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) convention, researchers said that 10% of horses develop the neurological form of the disease. It is unclear why some horses develop this form and not others. Some predisposing factors in horses that develop the neurological form include increasing age, female sex, pregnancy, or nursing. Certain breeds seem more susceptible including standardbreds, warmbloods, thoroughbreds, quarter horses, paints, appaloosas, Spanish horses, fjords, draft horses, and the Lipizzaner. According to the publication The Horse, the first infection begins in the respiratory tract, and the virus is picked up by the lymph nodes where it enters the bloodstream. This is when the neurological form occurs. The virus attacks the blood vessels resulting in vasculitis, in which white blood cells infiltrate the area, developing blood clots that cause tissue destruction. In the study, the young horses that developed only the respiratory disease had two different temperature spikes while the horses that developed neurological disease only showed the secondary fever spike. Horses that developed either the respiratory form of the disease or the neurological form had classic responses consistent with the form of disease they had developed. Scientists are looking to alter the immune response to decrease the neurological form of the disease.

Category: Small Airway Inflammatory Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on the program I am going to discuss a chronic lung disease of horses called small airway inflammatory disease, or SAID. This is not a contagious disease but a disease that in the first stages causes exercise intolerance. You may feel your horse is just not as responsive as in the past when being worked. Maybe he doesn't seem to have the energy and appears to be slowing down. This problem develops gradually, and the hotter the temperature the more affected the horse seems to be. Also, an intermittent deep cough may be noted due to excessive mucous in the airways. The difference between this syndrome and an infectious disease is that infectious diseases are usually acute and the horse usually feels bad and may stop eating, which does not generally occur with SAID. The cause of SAID is related to allergens and many horses are more affected in the spring and summer because of more allergens and the heat at the same time. However, many horses also develop this syndrome in the winter as they are stalled in barns because of the weather and exposed to dust and other allergens. Dust in a horse stall contains molds, bacteria, fungi, ammonia, and other chemicals that are harmful to the airways. These particles are trapped inside the airways and cause inflammation and some horses are more sensitive to these particles than others, and more severely affected horses develop a condition called heaves. Diagnosis of the condition is made by placing a tube in the lung and retrieving fluid for analysis, a process called a bronchoalveolar lavage. Treatment of the disease involves bronchodilators, anti-inflammatories, and maybe most important of all, environmental management changes. Join us on our next program for specifics on treatment.

Category: Viral Respiratory Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Respiratory disease is common at horse shows and sale events when many horses congregate and are mixed together.  The most common causes of respiratory disease are viral and involve equine influenza, equine herpes virus 1, and equine herpes virus 4.  Equine herpes virus is referred to as EHV, and is the same disease previously called rhinopneumonitis or in many cases, just rhino.  This term is no longer used because we now know an actual rhino virus can also affect horses and herpes is a totally different virus. During the past decade, there have been a number of outbreaks of herpes virus 1 that causes not only a respiratory disease but a neurological disease as well as abortion.  However, the neurological herpes disease is the one that is associated with the most concern as this is due to a mutation in the virus, and there is a concern if this virus is being shed routinely at equine events.  A group of vets at Colorado State studied horses at four horse shows and tested them for influenza, EHV 4 and EHV 1.  Results indicated all three viruses were found in some horses at all horse shows tested although the levels were low.  Actual viral infection due to an influenza outbreak at the shows was only found at one show in Florida.  Most of the horses shedding viruses were less than 2 years old. This study proved that young horses attending equine events did fairly commonly shed respiratory viruses.  Because of this, we recommend that you vaccinate your horses for equine influenza, EHV 1, and EHV 4 before taking your horse to a show.  Vaccination does not provide 100% protection against the diseases but hopefully decreases shedding of the viruses.  Unfortunately, there is no vaccine licensed to prevent the neurological form of EHV 1.

Category: Why Is Your Horse Coughing?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Coughing in horses is not uncommon. There are many different causes why your horse may be coughing, and the cause determines the treatment. Dr. Erica Lacher, DVM, of Springhill Equine Veterinary Clinic in Florida, says in the publicationThe Horsethat there are many reasons for coughing in horses. Feed-related coughs are usually associated with an oversensitive pharyngeal area in the back of the horse’s throat. Coughs occurring when your horse eats hay suggest an allergy to food, pollen, or fungal spores. Horses that cough when entering the barn may be allergic to barn dust or ammonia. Many horses with these kinds of allergies developasthma,and horses that cough while on pasture but are normal otherwise may have summer pasture-associated asthma. Coughing at the start of exercise might be due to clearing mucous and may not be a big issue if the cough stops quickly. Coughs that persist while exercising could mean a more serious problem like infection, asthma, or an issue with the soft palate, which is a structure in the throat that, if displaced, decreases the ability of the horse to breathe. Coughing after exercise could mean the horse may have bleeding in the lungs, called exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. Mucous from a runny nose that is clear to white is likely due to allergy or dust, while a yellow or green nasal discharge likely indicates a bacterial or fungal infection. If a fever is present with a temperature over 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit, pneumonia or other infection should be considered. If your horse is lethargic or not eating as well as usual, it is important to call your veterinarian for an exam. Although many clients want to start antibiotics if their horse is coughing, antibiotics are unnecessary in most cases of coughing and can actually be detrimental.

Category: Adopting an Orphan Foal
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most difficult problems that can occur on a breeding farm is the death of a mare immediately after she foals; raising an orphan foal is not an easy task. The first thing to consider is that the foal must receive colostrum, or first milk, within the first 24 hours of birth to provide immunity. It is always a good idea for a horse farm to have frozen colostrum that was collected from another foaling mare in the freezer in case it is needed. In some cases, nurse mares can be found but these are not available in most areas. Orphan foals can be raised on milk replacer fed out of a bucket or bottle or can be fed goat’s milk. However, bottle or bucket feeding is time consuming and is not the best social training for a foal. Another option is to stimulate another mare to start producing milk and then teach her to accept the foal so she will allow the foal to nurse. Mares that are going to be given medication to start producing milk should be mares that have foaled and raised a foal before. Also, mares chosen should be in good physical condition and calm. To induce lactation, mares are given a series of hormone treatments and the mare should be milked beginning on day 4 after starting the hormones. Dr. Peter Daels from Equine Embryo Transfer Center indicates introduction of the newborn foal and mare should be done in a closed stall with no other horses around. The mare should initially be separated from the foal with a bar to keep her confined and sometimes a tranquilizer is helpful to allow the new mare to get used to the foal. Most mares actually will start allowing the foal to nurse within 1 to 2 days.

Category: Blue Light Masks Help Brood Mares Cycle Early
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Mares are seasonally polyestrus, meaning they come into heat multiple times a year but only at certain times of the year. For mares in the northern hemisphere, those are times with increased day length as they normally only cycle from March to October. But since the birthdate of many horse breeds is artificially set at January 1 for aging purposes, the earlier in the year the foal is born, the better for showing and performance. So the goal is to get a mare to come into heat and get pregnant as early in the year as possible so the foal will be born as close to the first of the year as possible. It is difficult for a two-year old horse born in May to compete with a two-year old born in February because that three months makes a lot of difference in maturity, size and athletic ability at that age. The best method to get these mares to cycle early is to expose them to light throughout the winter and trick their hormonal system into thinking the days are actually longer than they really are. So beginning December 1, most brood mares are placed in the barn at dusk and the lights in the barn are turned on so the mares will get 16 hours light per day during the winter and be ready to cycle in the spring. And although this is effective, it means you have to stall mares longer than normal, which means extra labor. Also, stalled horses tend to colic more than horses at pasture and most horses are generally happier at pasture. Dr. Barbara Murphy from Ireland has developed a face mask for the horse to wear that provides a short wavelength of blue light that mimics sunlight, so the horse can get extra light needed for cycling but can remain in the pasture. If you have brood mares that you want to get pregnant early but do not want to stall them, ask your vet about this blue light-producing face mask.

Category: Breeding a Performance Mare
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have a performance mare who is doing well and you would like a foal out of her, you can decide to lay her off a year for the pregnancy, but most folks do not want to do that. An option is embryo transfer in which you breed the mare, and then one week after breeding, flush the embryo out and place it in a recipient mare to carry the pregnancy. This procedure still may require a few weeks off training because exercising mares in a warm environment seems to decrease fertility. The other downside of embryo transfer is the cost, as it usually runs about $5000; this is a lot more than a normal breeding but if the mare is really good and you don’t want to miss a performance season, then embryo transfer may be an option. . Another option, even if your mare has a problem with her uterus or ovaries, is called oocyte transfer. This technique is used in mares that cannot ovulate, have a blockage of the oviduct so the egg cannot enter the uterus, or in cases in which the mare has a severe uterine infection or uterine damage. In this technique, the egg or oocyte is removed from the ovary with a needle prior to the time of ovulation. The mare that is to receive the egg is bred and the egg is surgically placed in her oviduct. This technique is obviously not inexpensive and is usually around $10,000. So if you have a performance mare that you would like to breed but do not want to miss a performance season, these are two viable options.

Category: Breeding the Older Maiden Mare
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Every breeding season we have a few mare owners that want to breed older maiden mares. A maiden mare is a mare that has never had a foal. These mares may have been busy performing for the first part of their life and now the owners would like to get a foal. Many owners feel this should not be a problem because the mares should be just like young maiden mares and not have any uterine pathology. However, Dr. Jonathon Pycock indicates that there is a good possibility that older maiden mares may have difficulty conceiving. Even though these mares have not been bred, aging changes still occur such as glandular degeneration and endometriosis. Also, many of these older maiden mares have excessive uterine fluid and excessive uterine fluid has been shown to be a cause of reduced fertility. One cause of excessive uterine fluid is a tight cervix that is unable to dilate properly and prevents normal uterine drainage. These mares generally have no signs of inflammation in the uterus but fail to get pregnant and accumulate fluid in the uterus. If there is more than 1 cm of fluid in the uterus during heat, oxytocin should be used to get rid of this fluid. If there is greater than 2 cm of fluid seen on ultrasound, the uterus may need to be drained and flushed. If there is significant uterine fluid 18 hours after breeding, then the mare can be considered to have delayed uterine clearance. Along with oxytocin and uterine flushing, a prostaglandin such as cloprostenol can be used to decrease the volume of uterine fluid. Cloprostenol actually lasts longer than oxytocin but Dr. Pycock indicates it should not be used after breeding. If you have a maiden mare that has not gotten pregnant, consult your vet for an exam.

Category: Broodmare Management
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. David Hartman from Whitesboro, Texas, indicates in Remuda Magazine that endometritis, or a uterine infection, is a common condition that causes infertility in many mares. He believes veterinarians and breeding farm personnel are involved either directly or indirectly as the cause of this problem. Rectal palpation is a common procedure that be performed on broodmares to examine the reproductive tract. If it is not performed correctly this procedure can contaminate the genital area, which can lead to infection. This infection can be introduced into the uterus at breeding, which can prevent pregnancy. To determine if a mare is infected, a uterine culture and a uterine cytology are important. Dr. Hartman indicates he believes cultures should be performed when the mare is in advanced heat as cultures taken at other times can be falsely negative. However, the cytology result is important to compare with the culture result because contamination can also cause false positive cultures. Another method to increase pregnancy rate is to examine the mare’s ovaries, determine when she is going to ovulate, and give a drug to stimulate ovulation. This allows her to be bred only one time in most cases, which limits contamination. In cases in which the stallion has poor semen quality, insemination with a flexible pipette can be used to place the semen next to the ovulating ovary.

Category: Complications of Equine Castration
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although equine castration is a common procedure, it is not without complications in some cases.  Equine veterinarians castrate hundreds of horses over their careers and most do very well.  However, complications can occur and the first one is bleeding.  In most cases, the castration incision is left open to drain and most of the incisions will bleed a small amount at the time of surgery and may have some blood dripping for 1-2 days.  However, the vessels to the testicles are large and if these vessels are not treated correctly, significant hemorrhage can occur and can even lead to the horse’s death.  The vessels are either crimped, twisted, or ligated (tied) with suture to prevent bleeding and some horses — and especially donkeys — tend to bleed more than others.  Ligating the vessels with suture is the best option but can result in chronic infection called a scirrhous cord, which will require more surgery so most vets do not like using suture.  If bleeding does occur, it can be a real problem as the vessels retract up into the abdominal cavity and cannot be ligated if bleeding continues unless the horse can be taken to a referral center for major abdominal surgery. The next concern is an inguinal hernia in which case the intestines can come out of the abdominal cavity through the castration incision.  Some horses have a large inguinal ring and through no fault of the vet, part of the intestine can enter the inguinal canal and exit the skin.  This can be a deadly complication unless treated aggressively and immediately.  Lastly, an infection at the incision can occur and this is usually due to flies contaminating the open wound so I do not like castrating horses in the summer and recommend doing this procedure in colder weather when there are less fly problems.

Category: Complications Using Glass Balls to Suppress a Mare's Estrus
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Mares begin cycling in spring as most do not cycle in the winter. And if you have a mare that acts crazy and has behavior problems when in heat, you may be looking for some help. Some of these mares are so severely affected that they cannot even be ridden when in heat and many of them do not perform up to their potential. There are several things that can be done to suppress heat. One of these things that has been common is to insert a sterile glass ball or marble in the mare’s uterus. The glass ball or marble is believed to simulate a pregnancy and keep the mare from cycling. This technique was studied and published. I have used the procedure and it seemed to be effective in about 50% of the mares into whom I inserted a marble. However, a recent report indicates using these marbles may be dangerous and one report indicated the mare developed a severe infection, while in another report two glass balls were used and they broke apart and the glass became embedded in the uterus. Whether this was related to using two balls, which was not tested in the original research, or just something that happened, we don’t know. However, I think it is enough of a concern that I will be reluctant to use glass marbles in the future. The most common method used to prevent heat in mares is to give a commercial hormone or progestin that must be given daily and is expensive. There is a compounded long-acting product that is effective in preventing heat. The newest technique is to use oxytocin to keep mares from cycling. If you have a mare with behavior problems when she is in heat, ask your vet for help.

Category: CPR in Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is commonly used in human medicine and is used in animals as well. In adult horses, it is technically impossible to give CPR due to the size of the animals. However, it can be helpful in foals and today we are going to talk about this procedure. CPR is indicated in any case in which the foal stops breathing or does not have a heartbeat. The most important thing is to have personnel ready if you have a mare that you think might be giving birth to a compromised foal. Newborn foals born from mares with high risk pregnancies should be assumed to be compromised and may require CPR. Foals born when mares have a problem delivering, born too early, delivered by Caesarean section, or born from mares with a uterine infection called placentitis all may need CPR to survive. A normal foal should be breathing about 1 breath per second 30 seconds at birth and the heart beat should also be regular at about 1 beat per second. Any foals that have a lower respiratory rate or heart rate than about 1 per second may require resuscitation. All foals should be dried immediately after birth and fluid should be cleared from their mouths and noses. The foal's head can be lowered to aid in clearing fluid but the foal should not be suspended by its hindlimbs. If the foal is not breathing, the best method to get air into the foal is to pass a tube through the nose into the trachea, but this procedure requires a veterinarian. Be sure and join me for the next program for more on CPR in foals.

Category: CPR in New-borne Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A large percentage of foals that die shortly after birth do so because of a lack of oxygen; more foals die from respiratory problems than heart problems. Newborn foals that do not begin breathing spontaneously, are gasping, have a respiratory rate of less than 10 per minute, a heart rate less than 60 per minute, and are not responsive to stimulation all require resuscitation. As soon as the foal is born, the foal should be aggressively dried by rubbing and the foal's airway should be manually cleared. The nose should be manually cleared of fetal membranes and mucous. You can use a large bulb syringe if necessary or a 60cc syringe with rubber tubing on the end. Although many have recommended holding foals upside down to help clear the airways, this is no longer recommended as holding the foal upside down has been shown to inhibit breathing. Also, slapping, shaking, and spanking the foal is not recommended. If bleeding from the umbilicus is substantial it is okay to clamp the cord but in general this is not recommended and tying off the cord is not a good idea. As far as breathing, if the foal is not breathing or the heart rate is below 60, artificial breathing is required. The best method for doing this is to pass a tube into the trachea through the nose or mouth and then resuscitate the foal with a breathing bag. This is not an easy procedure and in most cases, your vet will be required unless your vet has instructed you on this procedure and you have the equipment. It is a good idea to have an inexpensive stethoscope around because if the foal's heart rate is below 60 beats per minute or if the breathing rate is less than 10 breaths per minute, your vet should be called.

Category: Deciding to Breed your Mare
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Are you thinking about breeding your mare? Dr. Barb Crabbe indicates in Horse and Rider that if you are deciding to breed her, you need to first decide if your mare is of the quality for breeding and what is your goal for the foal.  If you just want another horse, there are thousands of unwanted horses that can be adopted and we really don’t need any more horses.  You also have to decide if you want to decrease riding your mare toward the end of her pregnancy, especially if you are riding her for performance events.  Also, you need to think about possible complications that can occur with foaling that could be expensive, as well as the expense if the foal is not healthy. As far as breeding, you have to pick the stud you want to breed to and then look at the cost and logistics of doing so.  Are you going to take the mare to the stud and leave her for an extended period for breeding until she is pregnant or will you have her checked with ultrasound to determine when she is ready to breed?  Will you be using shipped or frozen semen?  All of these factors are important in determining if you want to and can afford to breed your mare.  The more popular the stud you are using, the more cost you can expect. You also have to realize that the mare is not the most fertile animal in the world and sometimes you spend money on ultrasound exams and semen, and the mare is still not pregnant.  Mares that are in their teens and have never had a foal before are generally the most difficult to get pregnant. So, talk with your local equine vet about breeding your mare and get their opinion.  They will be the ones potentially involved in the breeding process and certainly will be involved with the foal after it is born.

Category: Dummy Foals Have Nervous System Signs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dummy foals are also called neonatal encephalopathy and perinatal asphyxia syndrome. Dr. Pam Wilkins indicates in the Practitioner that there is a wide spectrum of clinical signs associated with dummy foal syndrome, including mild depression with loss of the suckle reflex, ranging up to severe signs including grand mal seizures. Most of these foals are normal at birth but usually start showing signs of nervous system disease within the first 24 hours. These foals can have abnormalities of other systems including gastrointestinal, kidneys, cardiovascular, respiratory and even endocrine systems. The cause of the syndrome is believed to be related to difficult birth or premature separation of the placenta at foaling, but some foals may have an unexplained decrease in oxygen even before foaling. These foals are quite difficult to treat on the farm and most of them really need to be in a hospital intensive care stall. Controlling seizures is critical as is supporting circulation and correcting metabolic abnormalities, and most of these therapies involve close monitoring of blood work and continual intravenous treatment. Some of these foals can develop fluid buildup (edema) in the brain, and treatment for that consists of medication to decrease brain swelling to avoid further damage. Some foals will require blood transfusions and for them fluid support is critical but you must be careful as giving too many fluids can lead to other problems. Some foals will require tube feeding or even intravenous feeding as without nutrition, many of these foals will become weak. If you have a foal that has any nervous system signs, the foal may be a dummy foal and most of those require immediate intensive care to survive.

Category: Embryo Transfer in Mares
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about embryo transfer in mares.  Many of you may have mares from which you would like a foal but the mare has been unable to carry a pregnancy to term.  Or maybe the mare has severe arthritis, or maybe even has foundered and cannot carry a foal.  These mares can still have a foal by using embryo transfer.  In embryo transfer, the mare is bred and in about 7 to 8 days, the resultant embryo is flushed from the mare’s uterus and placed into another mare to carry the pregnancy.  The original mare is called the donor mare because she donates the embryo, and the mare that receives and carries the foal is called the recipient mare. Probably the most common reason for embryo transfer is mares that have chronic infections and thus cannot maintain a pregnancy to term.  If they can just get pregnant and keep the embryo alive in their uterus for 7 to 8 days, the embryo can be flushed out and placed in the recipient mare.  It is possible to recover embryos from mares with these chronic infections but it does require some work.  The goal is to improve the environment in the uterus for just a few days until the embryo can be transferred. The most important part of this is flushing the uterus with large volumes of sterile fluids.  Flushing the mare both before breeding and after removes infectious material and gives the embryo a better chance of survival.  Sometimes antibiotics and antifungal agents may also need to be used before breeding these mares.  If none of these techniques are effective, it is even possible to take an ova or egg from a donor mare and place it in recipient mare and then she is bred.

Category: Estrous Behavior in Mules
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English For those of you with female mules, you probably have noticed that their behavior can change during their estrous or heat periods, just as it does in some horse mares.  Mules are a cross between a male donkey and a female horse. Female mules are commonly called mollies or mule mares and they actually have higher estrogen levels during their heat period than horses do.  Although there are very few studies on the heat cycle of mollies, it is known that they are sterile but still cycle normally.  With the advent of embryo transfer, mollies can even carry a fetus to term when a horse embryo is implanted in the uterus and can carry the foal to term, deliver the foal, and nurse the foal. A recent survey of mule owners revealed that the most common estrous behavioral change in mollies occurs when riding them due to frequent urination, tail whipping and performance issues.  The increased estrogen and decreased progesterone hormones during heat can lead to aggression, anxiety and irritability.  Also, some mollies will even try to steal foals from mares during the times they are in heat and will even try to steal calves from their mothers if in the same pasture with cows.  When these problems occur in mares, oftentimes they are treated with daily progesterone to keep them out of heat, which seems to be effective but is expensive.  There are other methods used in mares, but the most successful method is surgery to remove the ovaries.  This is not used in mares routinely because it prevents them from being bred in the future.  However, since mollies are sterile, breeding them is not a concern.  So, if you have a mare mule that is exhibiting behavioral problems when she is in heat, talk with your veterinarian about removing her ovaries to resolve the issue.

Category: Estrous Cycle Control in Mares
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the major problems with using mares in performance events is that some of them exhibit strange and unusual behaviors when they are in heat. Whether the mare actually has a training or performance problem or the owner or trainer just thinks the mare has a problem is difficult to determine. Regardless, many mare owners have used multiple options to suppress estrous to prevent the unwanted behavior. The most common method of preventing mares from coming into heat is a progesterone drug called Regu-Mate that works well, but it must be used daily and is fairly expensive. A compounded, injectable form of the drug is also available that lasts for 30 days but since it is compounded, it is not approved by the FDA. Another option is to insert a 35 mm glass ball or marble into the uterus. This therapy has been shown to be effective in some mares while others do not respond. Disadvantages include the glass ball breaking in the uterus, and it is difficult to know if the ball is still in the uterus without a rectal exam. The newest method for preventing mares from coming into heat is to inject 60 units of oxytocin in the muscle twice a day on days seven through 14 after ovulation. This treatment has been shown to prevent mares from coming into heat for an extended period, and it is inexpensive. However, it is important to know when the mare ovulates, which requires a veterinary exam because the first oxytocin injection must be given on day seven after ovulation and be continued for one week. A recent report has shown that once daily administration of oxytocin is as effective as twice daily administration. The length of time mares are out of heat is variable, but this seems to be an effective option.

Category: Exercising Mares in Early Pregnancy
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although pregnant women are encouraged to exercise in most cases, it is not known whether pregnant horses should be exercised or not. It was determined that exercise prior to and on days immediately after fertilization was detrimental to embryo recovery rates in horses used as donors for embryo transfer. Also, it was determined that exercise prior to 16 days of pregnancy was detrimental. However, a study performed on mares that were 9 months pregnant did not find any elevations in fetal heart rate and the authors concluded exercise did not induce stress in the fetus. Many times owners call our office and ask if it is okay if they ride their pregnant mare and how much exercise is too much. We really don't know the answer to that question. I usually tell people that light riding is okay up until eight months of pregnancy but that is just my opinion and there is no scientific evidence to support that recommendation. However, I have never seen a problem in any pregnant mares from light exercise early in pregnancy. A recent study will help answer part of this question as a group of veterinarians from Florida and Clemson exercised eight mares from day 16 to day 80 and analyzed hormones and ultrasound appearance of the pregnancies. Mares were exercised 30 minutes for the first two weeks and then 45 minutes at a long trot and canter with breaks every 5-10 minutes for the duration of the study. Results indicated exercising pregnant mares from day 16 to day 80 of pregnancy did not appear to be harmful to the growing fetus. An interesting finding was that in exercised mares, the fetus was longer, which is similar to studies in women who exercise in early pregnancy as their fetuses have longer fetal crown to heel length.

Category: Factors Affecting Pregnancy in Performance Mares
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In performance horses, there is always a question about exercise during breeding season, so research has been undertaken to answer this question. In the study, one group of mares were exercised at a long trot and canter for 30 minutes from 1-3 p.m. when the temperature was above 86 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity greater than 50 percent, while the control group of mares was not exercised. Results indicated that exercised mares developed smaller follicles and fewer embryos were recovered from exercised mares compared to non-exercised mares. Also, the exercised mares that did have embryos had poorer quality embryos than the non-exercised mares. Another study had a control group with no exercise, a group with daily exercise until ovulation occurred, and another group that was exercised the entire time. As in the previous study, fewer embryos were recovered from mares with any exercise. Heart rates were increased in exercised mares after exercise as were cortisol levels, and ovarian blood flow also increased, but the increased blood flow did not increase embryo recovery rates. It is believed that increased cortisol with exercise was the reason for the decreased recovery rates. However, cortisol also increases with transportation of mares but it has been shown that transportation does not have an effect on ovulation or pregnancy rates in mares. So if you are planning on breeding your mare, transporting her for breeding seems to be okay but exercising her in the heat can decrease the pregnancy rate.

Category: Feeding the Lean Lactating Mare at Weaning
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many mares who are weaning foals will be very thin as they have used a lot of their energy in milk production. Dr. Kathleen Crandall from Kentucky Equine Research indicates that these mares need to be conditioned properly to prepare for pregnancy and lactation in the next year. Lots of broodmare owners will decrease the mare's nutrition at the time of weaning to help lessen the mare's milk production. However, there is no scientific evidence to support the practice of decreasing nutrition to decrease or stop milk production. Nonetheless, when energy reduction is performed gradually, such as slowly decreasing concentrates being fed to the mare over a 2-week period, no ill effects were noted with mares that were in moderate or above-moderate body condition. The foal should continue to have access to concentrates even if the mare's supply of concentrates is reduced. Again, this is with mares in good flesh, but feeding of thin mares is much different. Milk production continues because of the stimulus of nursing and after weaning, milk production decreases. If you attempt to milk out these mares, you will only provide a stimulus for further milk production so it is advisable to just monitor these mares for pain or heat that could indicate mastitis. And while withholding feed could decrease milk production, this should not be done with thin mares, but you should not have to increase calories either as once the foal is weaned, all calories can be used for weight gain instead of feeding the foal. If weight gain does not occur in a couple of months, fat can be safely added to the diet as a source of extra calories.

Category: Neonatal Isoerythrolysis in Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today we are going to discuss a condition that develops in newborn foals that causes the destruction of their red blood cells. The condition is called neonatal isoerythrolysis and although that sounds like a confusing term, it simply means that the foal's red blood cells are being destroyed. The mare has antibodies that can damage the foal's red blood cells, and the antibodies are absorbed in the colostrum when the foal nurses. These antibodies then destroy the foal's red blood cells and cause anemia. These foals become weak usually in the first 1 to 4 days of life, and their mucous membranes become pale and then develop a yellow color called icterus. If the problem is discovered before 24 hours of age, the foal must be stopped from nursing and fed an alternative food source. However, most of the time a foal is found to be sick after all the antibodies have already been ingested. Treatment of these foals sometimes requires a blood transfusion. Blood can by collected from the mare for transfusion, but it must be washed multiple times to remove the antibodies. Also, blood can be collected from another horse that is negative for the most common reactive blood types. It's a lot easier to prevent this syndrome than treat it. If a mare has had a foal develop this problem in the past, it is a possibility she could do so again. To determine if a future foal might be at risk for developing this condition, blood testing of the mare and stallion can be performed before the mare is even bred. Also, if the mare is already pregnant, the mare's blood can be tested for anti red blood cell antibodies by sending samples to the University of California at Davis.

Category: Newborn Foal Examination
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When foals are born, there are several areas that need to be addressed.  First of all, Drs. Chris Sanchez and Phoebe Smith indicate that all newborn foals should have their immunoglobulin level checked to make sure they received adequate colostrum from the mare to provide immunity against disease.  I usually check this level at 12 hours after birth so foals born at night are checked the next morning, and those born in the morning are checked late afternoon.  If the blood test indicates immunoglobulin levels are low, we feed colostrum and recheck or we give intravenous plasma.  Regardless, it is important to check the levels so you can make an accurate decision. Although we previously gave foals tetanus antitoxin, this is not recommended anymore unless the mare was not vaccinated for tetanus prior to foaling. Hopefully she was vaccinated.  An enema is commonly given to newborn foals immediately after birth to aid in passing the meconium or first stool.  I typically use sodium phosphate or Fleet enemas but many use dish soap in warm water.  It is also important to have your vet check for umbilical and inguinal hernias when they examine the foal at around 12 hours. If the farm has a history of infections in newborn foals, I usually treat them with antibiotic injections the first three days of life but this is controversial so ask what your vet for a preference.  Lastly, if you have a foal that seems uninterested in rising and nursing and is just not right, using the Madigan foal squeeze method is a good idea.  This involves placing a rope around the foal in a special pattern for 20 minutes. It has been shown to wake up some of these so called dummy foals.  MultipleYouTube videosof the Madigan foal squeeze method are available.

Category: Nutritional Recommendations for Brood Mares just before Winter
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The University of Kentucky Extension indicates that the body condition of all brood mares should be monitored and their body condition score, or BCS, documented.  Mares need to be in good body condition going into the winter so they will be able to rebreed in the spring.  Brood mares entering the breeding season should have a BCS of 5 on a scale of 1-9 in which 1 is emaciated and 9 is obese.  Pregnant mares going into the winter should have a body score of 6; mares with a body score of 5-6 have ribs that can be easily felt but not seen.  A horse with a body score of 7 or greater has ribs that are difficult to feel and being too heavy can lead to a problem with foaling.  As pasture declines in the fall, mares will need to be fed hay. You can determine when you need to feed hay by placing some hay in the pasture and if the mares eat it, they probably need it.  Also, feeding a little hay early may help to save the pasture and prevent overgrazing.Many types of hay are acceptable for brood mares but tall fescue should not be used as it can be infected with a fungus that can lead to problems in late pregnancy.  Tall fescue is not common in Texas while alfalfa and Bermuda are the most common hays fed to brood mares in Texas.  Alfalfa is higher in nutrients than Bermuda so less alfalfa can be fed and also less concentrates will be needed when feeding alfalfa versus feeding Bermuda.  Some mares can maintain body weight on alfalfa alone but will need a vitamin and mineral supplement to balance the ration. However, most mares in late gestation, and especially after the foal is born, will require commercial concentrate feeds to supply the energy needed for lactation.

Category: Pain Relief in Newborn Calves
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Calves that experience stress and trauma due to a difficult birth usually get off to a slow start.  Depending on the severity of the calving trauma, calves can have trouble keeping warm, be low in oxygen, and may have rib or other fractures.  Both the calf and the cow may be in pain and are certainly fatigued in some cases, and these calves are at a greater risk of dying during the first 24 hours than calves born with no complications. Dr. Faith Cullens from the Michigan State Extension Service indicates atBovine Vet Onlinethat a study looked at giving the calves pain medication immediately following birth.  The study was conducted on two commercial dairy farms in Canada and almost 300 calves were assessed for vigor at birth.  Half of the calves were injected with an anti-inflammatory pain medication and the other half were not.  Vigor was assessed as visual appearance, initiating movement, general responsiveness, and oxygenation and respiratory rates.  Calves treated with the anti-inflammatories had increased vigor and an improved suckling reflex. Also, calves were followed until 8 weeks of age and it was noted that calves injected with the anti-inflammatory ingested a larger amount of milk, although overall health and average daily gain were not affected.  These results suggested that anti-inflammatory injections may be a good strategy to reduce pain and inflammation associated with birth. The drug used in this study was meloxicam, which is inexpensive with a half-life of only 26 hours so it is unlikely to have a long-term affect in these calves.  Although meloxicam is not approved by the FDA in the U.S. in cattle, it can be used as extra label if your veterinarian feels it is indicated and prescribes the correct dose, route of administration, and withdrawal time.

Category: pH Testing of Milk Predicts Foaling Time In Mares
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have a pregnant mare, one thing you would like to know is when she going to foal. Even if you have a breeding date, there is still a lot of variability and this causes a lot of sleepless nights. In the past, milk from the mare has been tested for calcium and electrolytes to get a range of foaling period and these tests are fairly successful if you have experience with them. There is a technique in Japan that wasreportedin the AVMA journal using simple pH strips to check the mare's milk and determine foaling time. Dr. Rob Franklin, a board certified internal medicine specialist, reports the pH testing of milk seems to be as accurate at predicting foaling time as the standard calcium tests strips. The pH strips are also less expensive and require less time to run the test. The pH milk test is performed by milking a very small amount of milk out of the teat, applying it to the test strip, and reading it immediately. Unlike the calcium test strips, thisrequires no mixing. If the pH is less than or equal to 6.4, the mare has a 97.7% likelihood of foaling within the next 72 hours. In the study, pH values greater than 6.4 corresponded to a 99.4% chance the mare would not foal within the next 24 hours. The bottom line is if the pH of the mare's milk is greater than 6.4, you can feel fairly sure she will not foal that night. Once it gets less than 6.4, she will foal within the next three days. You will need a pH paper with a narrow range of measurement from 5.5 to 8 and with a scale broken down into tenths of a pH to accurately perform this test. These are strips are available online.

Category: Physitis in Young Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Physitis is a condition that develops in foals who are between 3 and 6 months of age.  It is an inflammation of the growth plate at the ends of the long bones, and it usually occurs just above the knee, fetlock, or hock.  These areas become swollen and are painful, causing lameness of varying degrees.  The problem is a nutritional one in which growing foals are overfed and are getting too much energy in their diet.  It is common in foals grazing lush pasture or those being fed large amounts of grain to encourage rapid growth.  Diagnosis of the condition is suspected due to clinical signs of swelling above the joints but must be confirmed by X-rays to make sure the foal doesn’t have a fracture. If physitis is diagnosed, a diet analysis is required to make sure the foal is getting the correct amount of energy – enough, but not too much energy.  To reduce energy, some of these foals will need to be weaned if they are nursing mares that produce a lot of milk.  The hay may need to be changed from alfalfa to a good quality grass hay, and it may be necessary to replace high energy concentrates with a ration balancer.  Some breeders may be reluctant to decrease nutrition as they desire a certain size foal for a show or sale.  However, if a foal is lame, shows are not an option anyway. Regardless, we have to do what is best for the horse but we do not want to starve the foals so it is best to place them on a balanced diet with supplemental vitamins and minerals if necessary.  Also, confining these foals is critical as they are in pain and without confinement, these young foals will follow the mare all over the pasture, causing more pain and increasing the inflammation.

Category: Preparing for Your Mare to Foal
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When your mare is about to foal there are preparations you can make. Make sure your mare has been vaccinated prior to foaling to provide immunity in the colostrum for the foal. If possible, prepare a clean dry paddock for foaling since paddocks are usually cleaner than stalls. If you use a stall, make sure it is large enough and you have stripped, cleaned, and disinfected it. Use straw for bedding instead of shavings. All equipment used in the stall such as water buckets, feed buckets, and mats should also be disinfected using accelerated hydrogen peroxide. Accelerated hydrogen peroxide is very different from regular household hydrogen peroxide so ask your veterinarian if you need help finding effective disinfectants. Diluted bleach is also effective as long as all organic matter is scrubbed away first. Ideally, your pregnant mare has had an ultrasound exam showing the placenta. Thirty days prior to foaling make sure you have a foal alert or camera system at the paddock or stall. Be sure to remove the caslicks vulvar suture if the mare has one. Booster the mare’s vaccine 30 days prior to foaling as well. Make sure you have clean, dry towels, a garbage bag to save the placenta for your veterinarian to examine, and a trailer ready in case the mare requires transportation for a c-section surgery at a hospital. Preparing in advance can minimize any complications during foaling. After the foal is born, call your veterinarian for a new foal exam and blood test to check for adequate colostrum ingestion at 12 hours after birth.

Category: Progesterone Supplementation in Mares
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The hormone progesterone is commonly used in pregnant mares as some believe it helps to maintain pregnancy and prevent abortion. In reality, most of the mares supplemented with progesterone probably do not need it. Dr. Peter Daels indicates that progesterone is the only hormone that needs to be replaced to maintain pregnancy. You can even remove the ovaries in mares during the first 3 months and they will still remain pregnant as long as they are supplemented with progesterone. For the first 100 days of pregnancy, all of the progesterone is produced by a structure on the ovary. After 100 days, the placenta produces enough progesterone to maintain pregnancy. Use of progesterone after 100 days is not needed in most cases and since it costs about $3 per day, it is quite expensive. Another reason to not use progesterone unless necessary is that a mare will not come back into heat if she aborts. For this reason, it is important to check mares regularly to make sure they are still pregnant when on Regu-Mate. Although there are several products with progesterone in them, the only ones shown to work in mares are Regu-Mate and progesterone injections. In early pregnancy, blood tests can determine if a mare needs to be supplemented. However, in later pregnancy, the progesterone produced by the placenta does not show up on blood tests. It is believed by many that mares that become ill during later pregnancy may benefit from Regu-Mate. Since blood tests can not determine if it is needed or not, it may be important to use Regu-Mate in pregnant mares while they are ill to help maintain pregnancy.

Category: Reproduction in Obese Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English I have talked about equine metabolic syndrome and equine Cushing's disease in horses and today I am going to talk about reproduction in mares affected with these conditions. If you have a mare that has equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing's disease, there is some evidence these horses may be less fertile than other horses. First of all, it's really not a good idea for these mares to carry a foal anyway because they are susceptible to laminitis and founder, and the added weight of a foal will not help. Also, it has been shown that older horses have a persistent low-grade inflammation caused by production of some inflammatory mediators and increased body fat may be a contributor as fatty tissue increases production of the inflammatory chemicals. Although it is not known what effect these chemicals have on fertility, many of these overweight horses tend to cycle throughout the winter whereas healthy horses stop cycling from October to February. Also, the cycles on these overweight mares can be abnormal as the interval between cycles is much greater. The hormone progesterone is elevated longer in these horses and this fact, coupled with the decreased immunity in horses with Cushing's disease, makes them more susceptible to infections. Since uterine infections are a major cause of infertility in mares, these mares in general are less fertile. So if you have an older mare that you would like to breed that is overweight and has equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing's disease, it is important to address these problems before considering breeding.

Category: Retained Placenta in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A retained placenta in a mare is a serious problem that can lead to death.This condition is much differentin horsesthan incattle because although a problem can develop in cattle with a retained placenta, it is generally much less critical. In horses, the entire placenta should be passed in 3 hours and any portion of the placenta remaining after this time is considered retained. If any portion is retained, you should not adopt a wait and see approach but should call your veterinarian immediately. It is important for the horse owner to realize that this is an emergency situation, and tonever pull on the placenta by hand. If the placenta is dragging the ground, it is okay to tie a knot in it so the mare will not step on it, but you do not want to cut it off as the weight of the placenta will hopefully lead to expulsion. If the placenta has only been retained for a few hours, many times multiple injections of oxytocin can cause the placenta to drop without further treatment. If this is not effective, your vet will generally flush the uterus to encourage removal and flush out material that can lead to infection. If the placenta is retained for longer than 8 hours, a painful foot condition called laminitis can occur. Prevention of laminitis involves icing the mare's feet continually for up to 3 days and using anti-inflammatories as well as other treatments. Icing the feet continually is not an easy job but it has been shown to be effective. The important point hereis that if your mare has a retained placenta, call your veterinarian immediately as there is a risk of losing your mare without aggressive treatment.

Category: Best Grazing Time for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In general, keeping your horse in the pasture is much better than in a stall. Horses that are turned out have a lower incidence of colic, anxiety, fear, and less behavioral abnormalities. However, all horses cannot be out on pasture all the time and some cannot be on pasture at all. Horses with insulin resistance or those that are overweight should not be on pasture at all without a grazing muzzle because most pastures contain large amounts of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) and fructan is a major part of the NSCs. Kentucky Equine Research indicates that ingesting fructans is the main reason horses develop laminitis and founder on grass; it happens because the fructans are not broken down in the upper GI tract but pass to the lower GI tract and ferment, which leads to the problem. The amount of fructan in the grass varies with the type of grass, time of day, season, and the part of the plant ingested. It is important to know that fructans are high in periods of rapid growth of grass that usually occurs in the early spring. Fructan levels are also higher in the stems than in the leaves, so avoid overgrazing to prevent horses eating close to the ground. In the fall as the grass starts to turn brown, many folks feel it is okay to turn these insulin-resistant horses out because the grass appears dead. However, stressed grass due to drought can also contain high levels of fructans so you still cannot turn these horses out without a grazing muzzle. Also, fructans are produced in the leaves due to the photosynthesis that occurs in the daytime, so grazing in the early morning will limit amount of fructans consumed.

Category: Carbohydrate Concentrations Affected by Grass Height for Grazing Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the major problems we see in horses and other equines is laminitis, and this is mostly due to eating pasture grass with a high concentration of carbohydrates. The intake of non-structural carbohydrates increases the glucose level in the blood, and this causes an increase in insulin. That increase causes laminitis, so many of these horses have to be taken off pasture. However, it is also not a good idea to stall these horses and so you have to turn them out in a dry lot, and many people do not have the facilities to do that. The researchers at North Carolina State studied the effects of mowing the grass and the effect that would have on insulin and glucose levels. The pasture used for the study consisted of tall fescue, and the tall height of the plants were 12 inches and about 6 inches tall after mowing. All horses used in the study were healthy with no evidence of equine metabolic syndrome, and horses were interchanged weekly on different pastures. Results indicated that horses did eat less when the grass was shorter, but they still ate enough to get the amount of forage needed for their requirements. Some horses did lose weight on the mowed pasture. However, we have to be careful looking at this study because although the carbohydrate intake was less in the mowed pasture, that doesn't mean it would be low enough to prevent laminitis in an insulin-resistant horse. Also, remember that this study was done using only fescue. If you have an insulin-resistant horse, this study doesn't mean you can just mow the pasture and turn your horse out because the horse could still develop laminitis from the shorter grass.

Category: Change your Horse's Diet Slowly
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today we are going to talk about changing your horse's diet. First of all, there is no need to change the diet if the horse is doing well as variety is generally not needed in horse diets. I think sometimes we change their diets because we are concerned about them getting tired of one feed and want to give them variety, but in most cases the horse doesn't really care. However, if you need to change a horse's diet, it should be done slowly, including grain, hay, and pasture. The horse's GI tract is sensitive to changes in the diet but can accept changes if they are not sudden. The reason change must be performed slowly is the microorganisms in the horse's hindgut are sensitive to changes in the feed as different feeds require different microorganisms for digestion. Abrupt changes in the diet, especially if carbohydrates are changed, can lead to a high pH in the hindgut, which can cause death of bacteria and release of toxins. These released toxins are absorbed into the circulation and lead to endotoxemia, colic, and founder. A recent study out of New Zealand fed six yearling fillies on pasture and six on silage for three weeks, and then the six on silage were transferred to pasture. The microbes from the horses on pasture were different than those on silage and after placing all horses on pasture, it required four days for the microbes to change after the new feed. For this reason, always mix new and old feed and even hay for 10 to 14 days when changing feed. To avoid having to use a new feed, never run out of feed completely so you have to buy a different brand, and always gradually introduce horses to a new pasture.

Category: Choosing Hay for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It is important to choose a good quality hay for your horses. Forage makes up about 50 to 90 percent of a horse's diet, and much of this comes from hay, especially in the winter. The most important factor in determining hay quality is the stage of plant maturity at the time of harvest. Young immature plants contain more nutrients than older plants with more stems, and there are also some other factors to examine when selecting hay for your horse. The first thing is you would like to see a high leaf to stem ratio and this goes back to age of the plant at harvest as younger plants are more leafy. The plants with more leaves are more digestible, and you also want plants with smaller stems which also indicates the plants were younger when harvested. Good quality hay is also soft and pliable so if you take a handful and squeeze it, it should feel soft and not like a handful of sticks. And hay with no seedheads indicates the plants are young so if you see a hay sample with lots of seed heads, that hay is also likely to be stemmy and less digestible. Another important factor is the smell of the hay. It may take some experience to determine a difference in smell, but hay that smells musty or moldy is not a good choice. Mold and musty smelling hay is less palatable for your horses and can even cause allergic respiratory symptoms to occur in some horses. There also should be very little dust. Hays that are poor quality may contain dirt, mold, weeds and other foreign materials. Lastly, good quality hay should be bright green in color with little fading of the leaves.

Category: Cobalt Use Has No Known Benefit for Performance Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It appears the newest fad to give to racehorses to supposedly increase their performance is cobalt. Dr. Teresa Burns from Colorado State indicates in the Horse magazine that cobalt is a trace mineral found in B vitamins that horses require in their body but only in tiny amounts. Although trainers are supplementing horses with cobalt, no one really knows how much cobalt is needed to affect the horse’s body. One study examined five mares supplemented with various doses of cobalt. After being given the compound by IV, some of the horses became anxious, had a rapid heartbeat, had increased blood pressure, and had heart arrythmias. The authors concluded that administering cobalt intravenously to horses has a significant effect on the cardiovascular system that could result in large vessel ruptures, bleeding, severe injury, or death. There is no known benefit to giving intravenous cobalt to horses in this manner and the increased blood pressure could lead to organ damage in the horse and even human injury. The heart arrhythmia that was noted has been associated with a high risk of acute death. Dr. Burns indicates we really have no idea what ongoing cobalt administration does in horses as no studies have been performed. We don’t know if there really is a performance benefit, although we haven’t seen one yet, and what long term problems it could cause. However, cobalt has been shown to be fairly toxic in humans and rodents, causing various nerve and hormonal disorders. She indicates that research is being performed on cobalt in horses but she feels it has the potential to be quite harmful and should not be used in horses until research is completed.

Category: Consider Feeding Larger Harder Pelleted Feeds to your Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you feed pellets to your horse, it is possible the pellets are being consumed faster than is optimal for your horse’s health.  To increase chewing time, a group of German researchers developed a larger and harder pellet that requires more chewing, which stimulates more saliva production, and more saliva increases the pH of the stomach, thus decreasing the chance of stomach ulcers.  In the study reported in The Horse magazine, Dr. Mandy Bochnia measured chewing patterns and compared the time it took six warmblood mares to consume a 2-pound meal of standard commercial sized pellets versus the same weight of pellets that were three times larger.  Results indicated it took three times longer to eat the large pellet meals than the smaller ones. Additionally, the horses chewed significantly more before swallowing, which produces more acid-buffering saliva.  This is especially helpful in sport horses that have a high incidence of stomach ulcers and on high levels of concentrate rations. The pellets were not only larger but six times harder than the regular pellets, which increased chewing time.  The authors of the study said the hardness of the pellets might benefit the horse’s dental health as well, and might decrease sharp points that develop naturally.  Although this concept sounds interesting, I am concerned about horses swallowing a large hard pellet without chewing completely and leading to an esophageal obstruction or choke.  I think a lot more studies need to be done on these large, hard pellets before they are produced on a commercial basis. Certainly, these large, hard pellets would only be used in young horses as older horses with poor dentition could not chew them.

Category: Decreasing Horse Colic in Winter
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When cold weather arrives, one horse problem we are more concerned about than normal is colic. And although the weather here in Texas does not get as cold as it does up north, it is still cold enough to have an effect on the horses, and in fact, i think the effect in Texas may be greater than up north because our weather changes so much. We have days that are 70 degrees and the next day may be 30 degrees, and I believe this affects animals more than just constant cold. The main reason colic increases in cold weather is that horses do not drink enough water and I think these horses just aren't thirsty in cold weather. Also, hay has less water in it than green grass in the pasture, so that is another area of decreased moisture. With dry areas in the intestine, feed dries out and an impaction develops, thereby causing colic pain. Poor quality hay is less digestible, which increases the chance of colic. Many times during the winter, horse owners increase the volume of the horse's feed to meet the energy demands, but this can upset their digestive tract and cause a decrease in function. Another concern is that many horses are kept in stalls in the winter due to the cold temperature. Standing in a stall may slow movement of the digestive tract, which also leads to an impaction. Some options to increase water consumption are bringing warm water out to your horse or having heated water troughs or water bucket heaters. Soaking the hay in water may be helpful to increase your horse's water intake, and adding water to the feed will sometimes be effective if the horse will eat it. If you are going to increase feed, then increase the hay and not the concentrate. Finally, keep the horses out in the pasture as much as possible rather than in a stall.

Category: Dietary Tips for Hauling Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The most important nutritional concern when hauling horses, both in the trailer and at an event, is dehydration. Try to haul your horse in the early morning or late evening to avoid water loss by sweating while in the trailer. Next, make sure water is available. Experiment with different options to encourage your horse to drink, including flavoring your horse's water with sugar-free gelatin or adding a small amount of feed to the water. It is important to experiment with this flavoring while at home before you get on the road. Make sure water is always available and if your horse is not drinking, stop and unload to allow drinking. Dehydration can lead to colic as well as respiratory disease, so it is critical to prevent dehydration if possible. Another concern is changing diet. You never want to abruptly change a horse's diet especially before or during hauling or at a show. Always take your feed to the show and for use on the road and don't take a chance on changing feed as colic is likely to develop. The folks at Kentucky Equine Research recommend adding a probiotic to your horse's diet when traveling and this is probably a good idea as it is certainly not harmful. However, make sure you start this supplement at home before hauling and don't just add it just when you start hauling as that would be similar to a change in feed. Lastly, it is probably not a good idea to give medications to horses immediately before hauling as it will be difficult to observe a reaction. And if your horse needs medication, consult your veterinarian to see if it is recommended to give the specific medication during traveling.

Category: Digestion in Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The foal’s first meal is colostrum or first milk, and this first milk contains antibodies that help the foal fight off infection during its early life. Colostrum can be absorbed for up to 24 hours but the absorption rate is not equal as absorption the first 6 hours is much greater than the absorption the last 12 hours. The foal’s digestive tract changes rapidly during the first 2 weeks of life. Although the foal may nibble on grass at an early age, until about 2 months of age, the majority of nutrition comes from milk because the digestive tract is only able to handle milk. After 2 months of age, research from Kentucky Equine indicates the foal’s hindgut begins a period of maturation that lasts until about 6 months of age. The hindgut is populated by bacteria that the foal has ingested when nursing on the mare’s udder and by eating manure of the other horses. These bacteria colonize the hindgut and are necessary for hindgut fermentation to occur, which allows the older foal to utilize forage for nutrients. Of course, foals can also pick up infectious bacteria during this time that can lead to digestive tract and respiratory tract disease. One of the most common syndromes noted in almost all foals is foal heat diarrhea. Although it occurs at about the time the mare comes into her first heat after foaling, the mare’s foal heat really has nothing to do with the condition. Foal heat diarrhea is now believed to be due to microbial changes in the hindgut when the foal is about 10 days of age.

Category: Digestion in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about digestion in horses as it is different than many other domestic animals. Humans, dogs and cats have a simple stomach while cattle have a large rumen in which they can ferment grass and hay. Horses have the best of both worlds in this regard as they have a simple stomach but also have a cecum that acts as a large fermentation vat similar to the rumen in cattle. The difference is that the rumen in cattle is located at the beginning of the digestive tract while the cecum in horses is toward the end of the tract. What all this means is that horses can eat grass or hay, but they were designed to eat native grass by grazing on thousands of acres. They were not designed to eat large grain meals and large amounts of hay twice a day in a 1-hour period as they are required to do in most situations today. Then they stand around with nothing to eat the other 22 hours of the day and we wonder why we have so many colics, stomach ulcers and founders today. The small intestine is the major organ of digestion in the horse and this is the areain whichproteins, fats and carbohydrates are digested. Horses were initially thought to have a limited ability to digest fat because they do not have a gall bladder but they are actually efficient at digesting fat because bile from the liver is secreted directly into the small intestine. Non-structural carbohydrates are digested throughout the horse’s GI tract unless the amount of these carbohydrates overwhelms the ability of the small intestine to digest the full amount. The amount that reaches the cecum is rapidly fermented and causes a decrease in pH of the cecum, leading to severe digestive problems and possibly laminitis and founder.

Category: Digestion of Forage by Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An herbivore is an animal that eats plants. Most livestock that eat plants have a large vat called a rumen that ferments the vegetation before it enters the rest of the digestive tract. However, horses are unique in that they eat plants but do not have a rumen like cows - horses have a simple stomach. Horses are able to digest plants because they have a cecum, which is also a fermentation vat. The difference is that in horses the cecum is close to the end of the digestive tract, unlike animals with a rumen where the cecum is at beginning of the digestive tract. Because of this design, Dr. Karen Davidson with Purina Feeds indicates horses evolved as continuous grazers that grazed small, immature, easily-digested plants and were allowed unlimited free range grazing. Unfortunately, this scenario is not possible for most of today’s horse owners as most horses are kept in small areas and fed twice daily. The reason we see so many colic and founder cases is because horses are being fed in a manner that their body was not designed to support. And although there is not a lot we can do about this, as we certainly can’t turn all the horses out on the open range, it is important to realize the ideal management for horses and try to mimic this as closely as possible. For instance, you can see why it is important to keep horses out of stalls. Also, it is important to give them small amounts of feed as often as possible instead of feeding large amounts of hay and feed once daily. Although frequent feeding may be more difficult for you and take more time, you can see why it is more natural for the horse and may prevent colic. If you have questions about your horse’s nutrition, ask your equine veterinarian, who is your nutritional expert.

Category: Electrolyte Supplementation in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Working and performance horses produce a lot of sweat, so they not only lose fluid in sweat but they also lose electrolytes.  Dr. Kathleen Crandell with Kentucky Equine Research indicates that horses should have access to electrolytes year round. For those horses not working hard, loose or block salt may provide sufficient electrolytes. The concern with block mineral is that the amount the horse consumes may not be sufficient to meet his needs.  Sometimes the blocks are contaminated by the environment, especially if they are placed directly on the ground, which affects the taste and limits consumption. If you have a performance horse, a block is not sufficient as an electrolyte source and daily electrolytes are needed at a much higher level.  The major electrolytes that needed to be supplemented are sodium, potassium, and chloride; although table salt contains sodium and chloride, it does not contain potassium.  However, lite salt does contain potassium so you could add table salt and lite salt to your horse's feed. The amount of electrolytes your horse needs depends on the level of work the horse is doing. There are numerous flavored electrolyte products on the market that can be added to your horse’s feed to encourage him to eat the product. Unfortunately, a lot of these products don't contain enough electrolytes to be effective. The electrolyte paste veterinarians use contains about 9 grams of sodium per dose, which is about the same amount of sodium in one tablespoon of table salt.  However, the commercial paste also contains chloride and potassium as well as minerals calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium.

Category: Excessive Water Consumption in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Multiple diseases can cause your horse to drink excess water. Drinking excessive water in horses is not common, but when it occurs, the reason could be important. Dr. Emily Barnett, from the University of Minnesota, says in the publicationEquine Disease Quarterlythat a healthy average size horse weighing about 1,100 pounds will drink about 13 gallons of water each day, and produce about three to four gallons of urine daily. Horses classified as excessive water drinkers usually drink at least two times more than horses that drink the 13-gallon amount, sometimes more. If it is determined that your horse is drinking excessive water, one of the most common causes could be psychogenic polydipsia. Psychogenic polydipsiameans there is no real medical reason, and your horse is drinking excessive water because they want to, not because they have to do so. In other words, your horse is not sick but just wants to drink excessive water. This can be caused by stress relating to diet, management, or housing situations. Cushing’s disease is very common in older horses, and 30% of the horses with this disease drink excessive water. Chronic kidney disease will certainly cause horses to drink excessive water, but the amount of water consumed is not as great as those with other diseases and may go unnoticed. Your horse can develop diabetes, but this disease is much less common in horses than in small animals. Other causes of increased drinking are high salt diets, some sedatives or other drugs like corticosteroids, and drugs that can cause kidney failure, like some antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Bute or Banamine. If you notice your horse drinking lots of water and flooding the stall overnight with urine, call your veterinarian for an exam.

Category: Extruded Horse Feed vs Pelleted Horse Feed
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many of you with horses may have seen the terms extruded feed and pelleted feed and may even be feeding one of them to your horses and not know the difference.  Karen Biggs indicates in The Horse magazine that extrusion is a process of cooking ground grains with pressure and moist heat, then exposing them to cooler air so they pop like a kernel of corn. This method has been used for decades in the pet food industry, and also is the method of manufacturing breakfast foods and corn chips for people.  However, it has only been used for the last 30-40 years for equine foods and today is common in horse feed manufacturing. Pelleted feeds are warmed with dry heat for a brief period and are pushed through a die to make the pellets, while extruded feeds are cooked at a temperature of 260°F.  The heat softens the mixture and breaks the cross-links in the crystalline structure of starches, which makes the energy in the starches more available for absorption in the small intestine.  Basically, the cooking process predigests the starch, so the horse’s intestine does less work.  The cooking process takes about 10 minutes and the starches become more soluble in water with extrusion and the protein molecules are ruptured to aid in absorption.  Usually extruded feeds do not have preservatives since the moisture content is so low. However, if one is used, it is usually natural Vitamin C or Vitamin E to prevent the fat from becoming rancid.  Cooking grains has a downside as some of the natural vitamin content is destroyed but most companies add extra vitamins to balance the ration.  However, Dr. Al Kennedy said cooking does not destroy minerals, so consider giving extruded feeds to your horse as there are some advantages over pellets.

Category: Feed Routines and GI Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Frank Andrews is an equine veterinarian at LSU and is considered an expert in equine gastrointestinal disease. He indicates in Veterinary Practice News that there is a large number of myths when it comes to feeding horses. In today's program we are going to dispel some of those myths with actual facts about gastric ulcers in horses. A diet high in non-structural carbohydrates combined with heavy training and stall confinement is a recipe for stomach ulcers to form. Horses on pasture spend about 12 hours a day eating, which allows them to maintain a full stomach, and continuous grazing keeps the pH of the stomach higher than when the stomach is empty. Dr. Lou Anne Epperly indicates that one study found the risk of ulcers increased when the forage feeding interval exceeded six hours. Dr. Andrews indicates the biggest problem with performance horses today is they are stalled with little turnout and are only fed two to three times per day when they should have some hay or pasture available 24 hours a day. He recommends feeding lower amounts of corn and more oats and barley in the concentrate rations and cattle feed does not need to be fed to horses. When feeding concentrates, you should never feed over 5 pounds of grain per feeding per 1,000-pound horse but you can feed everysix hours if necessary. Probably more GI upsets are caused by people changing their horse's feed than anything else. The first question I ask when examining a horse with colic is if you have changed the feed, since 90% of colics have been shown to have a feed change in the last three days. Most people answer no and after questioning them further, when they think feed they are only thinking grain. Changing hay and pasture is still a feed change and will cause problems unless the changes are very slow over a 10 to 14 day period.

Category: Feeding a New Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When you purchase a new horse, try to keep him on the same feed, at least initially, until you can wean him over to a different feed if you want to. This includes hay, as the hay you have will be different than the hay the horse was eating. Although all the hay may be coastal or alfalfa, all batches of coastal and alfalfa are not the same. Then there is the concern about the pasture, as your pasture is certainly not going to be the same as the one the horse was in previously. So it is important to also get some hay from the previous owner and gradually wean the horse off onto the new hay and gradually introduce your new horse to the new pasture by limiting turnout. It is important to take the horse on a lead and walk around the entire pasture and slowly acclimate the new horse to your old horses. Show the horse the water source. It is not a bad idea to keep the horse up a few days to accomplish these tasks. The reason this is critical is the microorganisms in the horse's hindgut require gradual changes because a quick change in any feed upsets the beneficial microbes and can lead to colic or laminitis and founder. Most horses require a gradual transition period of two weeks to change feeds so the microorganisms can adapt. If you cannot get any feed the horse was being given, then gradually start adding in the new feed in low amounts and build up the total amount over two weeks. It is also important to feed small amounts frequently instead of just once or twice a day. Introducing a new horse to new feed may take some extra time, but may also save you from having to treat a sick horse.

Category: Feeding Alfalfa Hay Before Riding Your Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Feeding alfalfa hay to horses has been shown to decrease the formation of stomach or gastric ulcers. Deciding what is the best form of alfalfa to feed is more complicated. Clair Thunes, PhD, author for the publicationThe Horse,writes that alfalfa is high in calcium. High calcium decreases the amount of acid in the stomach due to its buffering ability, which reduces stomach acidity. In a study done at Texas A&M University, 12 horses were divided into two groups. For 28 days, Group One was fed Bermuda grass hay along with a concentrated feed, and Group Two was fed alfalfa hay and a concentrated feed. The horses were switched after a 21-day washout period. Before the study, horses had their stomachs scoped to figure out if any stomach ulcers were present and were scoped again after the 28-day treatment period. The researchers found ulcer severity scores were much lower when horses were fed alfalfa than Bermuda grass. The study showed that feeding alfalfa prevented ulcer formation in 11 of 12 horses, while only three of the 12 horses eating Bermuda grass did not have ulcers. The researchers believe this is due to high calcium and increased protein in alfalfa. Long-stem hay requires more chewing, which increases saliva and increases the buffering effect in your horse's stomach. Also, long-stem hay supplies better coverage in the stomach to protect sensitive tissue from gastric acid. The calcium in alfalfa pellets might buffer more quickly than hay due to the smaller particle size, but these smaller particles may move out of the stomach quicker than larger particles. If you are riding your horse on an empty stomach, alfalfa pellets will likely prevent more ulcers, although you will not get the covering, or mat, in the stomach like with hay.  If you arrive in time to feed your horse hay before riding, hay is likely the best choice to prevent ulceration.

Category: Feeding Alfalfa to Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Alfalfa is commonly fed to horses in many areas of the country, although less is fed in Texas than some other areas due partly to the concern with blister beetles in Texas-grown alfalfa. Like many other hays, alfalfa's nutrient quality depends on its maturity at harvest; the time of highest quality occurs before it is overly mature. Dr. Pete Gibbs from Texas A&M indicates that alfalfa is richer in nutrients than some other roughages and it is a good source of crude protein, fiber, and calcium. Alfalfa may have 30 percent higher crude protein than grass hays. Although alfalfa is more expensive than grass hay, it may be less expensive when you consider the higher amount of protein. Alfalfa has a 6:1 calcium to phosphorus ratio and this can help balance cereal grains because they are generally higher in phosphorus; feeding alfalfa means you don't have to buy other mineral supplements to feed your horse. Some alfalfa is treated with preservatives to increase storage life, and in most cases the preservatives are not dangerous for horses. Chopped alfalfa is also available and has been shown to have nutrient digestibility that is higher than that of average-quality chopped roughage. It works well for feeding horses that need additional protein, such as young growing horses and brood mares. Pelleted alfalfa is also available and can be added into a grain mix. Lesser amounts of pelleted alfalfa can be fed than long-stem alfalfa because the pellets contain a larger portion of rich leaves. If pellets are fed and no pasture is available, additional long-stem roughage should be fed to discourage bad habits such as wood chewing. Alfalfa cubes can also be mixed with grain based feeds and used when certain horses need supplemental feeding. However, there are times when alfalfa is not recommended. Dr. Catherine Whitehouse from Kentucky Equine Research indicates that it is not recommended in all cases. One concern of feeding alfalfa to foals is potential for contributing to orthopedic disease. Although developmental orthopedic disease has multiple causes, high-energy diets like in alfalfa can contribute to this problem. High-energy diets can be related to physitis, which is inflammation of the growth plates adjacent to a joint, that can lead to lameness and pain so if this develops, feeding alfalfa is not a good option. Replacing alfalfa with good quality grass hay is a good option for these foals as grass hay generally has less calories. However, you have to be careful, as lots of grass hay grown for dairy cattle may also have too much energy for some horses and this is especially true for overweight horses and those that are insulin resistant. These horses should not be fed alfalfa or even premium quality grass hay but should be fed low to moderate quality grass hay. Premium quality grass hay will have an abundance of leaves and pliable stems with a rich color. However, if you have horses that are insulin resistant due to a hormonal condition, the hay needs to be tested for nonstructural carbohydrates before feeding because you cannot tell the difference by just looking. If you are not sure about feeding your horse, consult with your equine veterinarian.

Category: Feeding Beet Pulp to Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When there is a hay shortage, lots of folks look for other forms of forage for their horses and one of those is beet pulp.  Dr. Burt Staniar from Penn State indicates in Equus Magazine that beet pulp is a fiber just like hay but the fiber is more easily digestible so the energy and calories it provides are available much quicker to the horse than hay.  It also is a good choice for older horses with dental problems and is commonly one of the ingredients in complete feed for older horses.  Also, beet pulp helps maintain the normal microbial populations in the intestine, which helps prevent digestive problems. Another reason to include beet pulp in the diet is it contains very little sugar as although initially called sugar beet pulp, all the sugar has been extracted and makes it an excellent feed for horses with equine metabolic syndrome that are insulin resistant.  In some cases, molasses is added to beet pulp to make it more palatable and this is okay unless your horse is insulin resistant.  Also, horses with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis or HYPP should avoid beet pulp with molasses so look for plain beet pulp. However, if you cannot find beet pulp without molasses, soaking the beet pulp will remove most of the molasses but if your horse is insulin resistant, I would not take that chance.  So, if you are running low on hay for the winter, beet pulp can help to replace some of the fiber that horses need.  However, you can’t replace all the hay in your horse’s diet with beet pulp because the calcium phosphorus ratio is 10:1 so beet pulp should not make up more than 10% of the horse’s diet.  Since beet pulp is routinely added to many feeds, it is probably better to choose a commercial feed containing beet pulp that is properly balanced rather than trying to add beet pulp and get the balance correct.

Category: Feeding Bran Mashes to Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English During cooler weather, many folks consider feeding bran mashes to their horses. It has been believed for years that bran mashes would warm up the horses and have a laxative effect that would clean them out and prevent colic. However, Dr. Lori Warren indicates bran does not have a laxative effect and adding wheat bran to the diet did not soften stools. In fact, the moisture content of the stool was the same with or without the wheat bran. Wheat bran does increase the bulk of the manure, giving the appearance that the horse is being cleaned out, but this is not the case. The laxative effect was attributed to the fiber in wheat bran. Human medical doctors recommend patients eat bran cereal or a bran muffin to keep regular but wheat bran is not a high-fiber food. In fact, wheat bran has about the same amount of fiber as oats and has less fiber than regular hay. The difference between people and horses is that humans have a diet that contains only about two percent fiber and a bran muffin may make a difference. However, the horse's diet is already about 35 percent fiber so a scoop of wheat bran will really have no effect. Although wheat bran is not a laxative, it is palatable for horses and it contains energy and protein similar to oats and thus should be thought of as a grain instead of fiber. One thing that is important to realize is that wheat bran as well as rice bran are high in phosphorus, and in horses high phosphorus decreases calcium resorption. Because of this, feeding wheat bran daily could cause a significant detrimental effect on your horse's health because it is not a balanced diet. Therefore, a wheat bran mash is not recommended or effective at preventing colic in horses.

Category: Feeding Bread to Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are many good equine feeds available and yet it seems some people continue to feed other foods to horses, and one of those is bread. Apparently some people feed lots of bread to their horses, especially in Europe, and the folks at Kentucky Equine Research published some information on this subject at equinews.com. Assuming the bread is made of wheat flour, yeast, salt and water, there is nothing in the bread that is toxic to horses and can add calories to the ration. Although there is no harm in feeding small amounts of bread intermittently, it is not very nutritious and provides few nutrients. Wheat is deficient in vitamins A, D, and E as well as zinc, copper, and selenium; all of these nutrients are required in the horse's diet. Anytime you feed anything to an animal that is not formulated for it, it is possible to shift the nutrient balance of the total diet. An example would be feeding bread, which is low in calcium because of the wheat, but wheat is not low in phosphorus. The larger amount of phosphorus interferes with calcium absorption, further contributing to the calcium deficiency. Without enough calcium in the horse's diet, the horse's body will start pulling calcium from the bones and weakening them; the more bread that is fed, the greater the chance this will occur. Bread is also too low in protein for most horses and if you are just feeding hay, a protein supplement will be required. Bread is also high in starch and if your horse has equine metabolic syndrome and is insulin resistant, bread could lead to laminitis and founder. So although many items like bread are not toxic to horses, it is still not a good idea to feed these items as there are much healthier choices for equine feeds.

Category: Feeding Concentrate to Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses evolved eating small amounts of grass while walking and grazing over many miles every day. Since they evolved in this manner, you can see why we have some of the problems we have today because we feed them differently. Many horses are turned out on pasture and fed a small amount of concentrates twice daily. The other end of the spectrum is racehorses that are kept in stalls 23 hours a day, exercised for one hour and fed a large amount of concentrates and hay twice daily. This is a common reason racehorses get colic and develop stomach ulcers as they are not designed to be fed in this manner. An 1,100 pound horse's stomach only holds about two to four gallons, which is not thatmuch for this size animal. The horse's stomach is somewhat flexible but not enough to accommodate large quantities of grain and hay at one time. And since horses cannot vomit, once the material is in the stomach there is only one direction it can travel in the GI tract. Another concern about feeding concentrates is that horses are also fed hay and it is impossible to know how much hay is in the horse's stomach, so adding a large quantity of concentrate can be a problem. Food leaves the stomach and goes to the small intestine where digestion takes place, and the small intestine is easily filled with material. This allows food to move too rapidly to the large intestine and can lead to colic and laminitis. So to avoid these problems, I recommend feeding no more than five pounds of concentrates at one feeding. The more often you can feed and the less amounts you feed, the less likely your horse will have problems.

Category: Feeding Donkeys and Mules
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Donkeys are becoming common as pets, and mules have a large following of equine folks.  We must realize donkeys are quite different than horses from a nutritional standpoint as they are efficient at digesting poor quality fiber.  As the donkey had adapted to surviving on poor quality feed, if donkeys are fed as miniature horses they will become obese and develop serious health problems.  It is suggested that donkeys ingest about 1.5 percent of their body weight in dry matter, which would be hay or grass, so for a 400-pound donkey this would be about six pounds of hay or grass per day.  A miniature horse or pony at 400 pounds should get at least two percent of their body weight in hay and grass, which would be at least eight pounds or 25 percent more feed.  You can see that feeding donkeys and mules as you feed horses will cause them to become overweight quickly. The forage donkeys need is not improved pasture like you may be feeding horses and cattle, but with a low energy value so they can eat enough to satisfy their appetite but not become obese.  Protein levels have not been established for donkeys but preliminary data indicates they need less protein than horses.  As far as vitamins and minerals, generally levels required are about the same as for horses.  In most cases, donkeys do not need to be given sweet feed or any concentrate feeds unless you want to use a small handful daily for training purposes.  Donkeys may even do well on barley or wheat straw, and although some have been concerned this could lead to colic or stomach ulcers, studies have shown this is not the case.  Unfortunately, we see lots of donkeys with laminitis and founder because they are grazing improved Bermuda grass pastures.

Category: Feeding Fat to Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It seems abnormal to recommend feeding high levels of fat to any animal, but feeding fat is beneficial to many horses. Fat is commonly used as an energy source for horses as it supplies two and one quarter times more calories per gram than carbohydrates. Your horse can get the same number of calories by eating fat as eating carbohydrates and are able to eat less volume. Eating large volumes of carbohydrates can lead to gastrointestinal disturbances like colic and laminitis, so feeding fat for calories is a safer option. Dr. Clair Thunes, PhD, Equine Nutrition Consultant with the publication The Horse, states that the horse’s body can only use fat as a fuel when working aerobically, or in the presence of oxygen in the tissues. However, this preserves stored glucose (called glycogen) for use during anaerobic work, such as intense exercise when tissues are without oxygen. Dietary fat also increases absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, E and K, and can increase workout time before your horse feels fatigued. Good quality pasture might have a fat content of 2-5% and this percentage may be less in hay. Pasture does have high levels of omega-3 fatty acids compared to the omega-6 fatty acids as does hay. However, concentrate feeds have higher levels of omega-6 fatty acids rather than omega-3 fatty acids, which can increase inflammation. Because omega-3 fatty acids are actually anti-inflammatory, some folks supplement their horse's diet with omega-3 fatty acids. To increase omega-3 fatty acids in the diet, many companies are adding ingredients such as flax seed to increase both omega-3 and -6 fatty acids. You can also add flax seed or corn oil to your horse’s diet to increase omega-3 fatty acids, but the ration may not be balanced. For this reason, it is recommended to use a high fat ration that is correctly balanced for horses compared to feeding vegetable oil.

Category: Feeding Horses During and after Colic
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Colic simply means the horse has abdominal pain, and that is related to the gastrointestinal tract. All colic cases are emergencies and even though some may subside without treatment, many will not and it is critical to have your vet involved rather than just walk the horse to see if they get better. Usually, they get worse and require more aggressive treatment. One of the most important parts of colic treatment is fluids as many of these horses dehydrate, which further decreases their gut function. Horses with colic will not drink or eat in most cases and so fluids have to either be given by a tube through the horse's nose or intravenous through a catheter. Never put a water hose in your horse's mouth to give them fluids as you will likely give them pneumonia instead. If you call your vet early, water can be given through a tube into the stomach, which is much less expensive than intravenous fluids. Fluid administered both intravenously and through a tube into the stomach will increase circulation and increase intestinal function in many cases. Pain control and mineral oil may be used also. After the colic seems to have resolved, monitoring water intake is critical. I recommend clients offer small handfuls of hay every 2 hours for 2 days after a colic and no grain for 2 days. Gradually start the grain back at one-quarter ration and increase slowly over a 7-day period. It is important to monitor appetite in horses that have had colic as I think it is one of the most sensitive signs that the horse is improving. Horses that do not have an appetite after colic treatment are probably still hurting.

Category: Feeding Horses with a Hay Net
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses evolved to eat small meals throughout the day while they grazed small amount of grass. In fact, most horses have been shown to graze about 15 hours out of a 24-hour day. So you can see why horses develop problems when we put them in box stalls and feed them twice a day, because instead of eating 15 hours per day, they eat for two. This change certainly affects their digestion as this is unnatural for horses and can lead to colic and stomach ulcers. Although all horses would be healthier out on pasture, the reality is that this is not possible for many horse owners. Because of this, it would be a good idea to feed horses that are stalled in a manner to make them eat smaller amounts of hay slower to mimic grazing of horses on pasture. One option to accomplish this goal could to feed hay in a net, The University of Minnesota recently published a study to determine the effect of the hay net design on the amount and rate of hay consumed by a horse. They fed horses hay in three nets that had different size holes: large six-inch holes, medium one-and-¾-inch holes, and small one-inch holes. Results indicated horses eating hay from the six-inch nets did not eat any longer than horses fed without a hay net. However, horses eating hay out of nets with medium and small openings in the nets ate significantly slower and therefore ate longer than horses without nets. These results indicate that horses fed hay out of nets with openings of one to one 1 to one-and-¾-inch holes in diameter ate slower and ate smaller amounts longer than horses eating without a hay net or a net with large holes. So if you have a horse that is stalled most of the day, feeding in a hay net with small holes may be healthier for your horse.

Category: Feeding Pumpkin to Your Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The first thing to consider when feeding any fruits or vegetables to your horses is whether the item is toxic. Just because a human can eat it does not mean a horse can. An article by Dr. Clair Thunes, Ph.D., published inThe Horse, says it is generally suitable to feed horses pumpkin, but you still need to be careful when feeding any fruits or vegetables to horses. You do need to consider the nutrient profile of the food, and this is especially important for horses that have equine metabolic syndrome, or EMS. For example, pumpkin has a low glycemic index, which means it does not cause a rapid increase in blood glucose, so it should be safe for horses with EMS, assuming a small amount is fed. However, pumpkin is high in potassium, so it would not be right for horses with Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis (known as HYPP, an inherited disease of the muscles). You can see that pumpkin, as well as other fruits and vegetables, are not always good for all horses. Dr. Thunes suggests cooking the pumpkin and making horse treats by adding oats, wheat bran, cinnamon, and molasses. However, these treats should not be given to overweight horses or those with metabolic diseases.Dr. Thunes also suggests placing a pumpkin in your horse’s stall for them to play with after first removing the stem to prevent choking. A major concern with feeding any abnormal food, meaning foods they would not usually have access to or eat, to horses is that it could lead to gastrointestinal problems, causing colic.It may not be worth taking the chance to feed your horse any of these fruits and vegetables. Always check with your veterinarian before feeding any fruits, vegetables, or other abnormal foods to your horse. You can find checklists of poisonous items on the Cornell University website and on the site of the Association for the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA).

Category: Feeding Recommendations for Miniature Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Lots of folks have miniature horses and sometimes determining the amount to feed these horses can be difficult for two reasons. First, it is difficult to accurately estimate their weight as many of the tapes and formulas used for weight estimation are for larger horses and may not be accurate in miniature horses. Secondly, feed recommendations are established by studies on larger horses and so it is questionable if you can accurately interpolate to a smaller size horse. In other words, if the feed bag says feed 4 pounds per day for a 1000-pound horse, that may not mean you should feed a 250 pound horse 1 pound per day. And this is really important because miniature horses and ponies tend to be very efficient at using feed and because of this they are called easy keepers. If possible, it is always a good idea to take your miniature horses to a scale at least once to have an accurate baseline weight. If these horses are overfed, they will commonly develop laminitis and founder due to being resistant to the effects of insulin. So if you feed the same ratio of feed per pound of body weight to a regular size horse as you do to a 200-pound miniature horse, it is possible you will be overfeeding the miniature horse. To determine if it is possible to interpolate amounts of feed required from large horses to miniatures, a study was performed in Kentucky and published in the Equine Veterinary Journal. The study found that using large horse recommendations for miniature horses either overestimated or underestimated the energy intake required, depending on the feed chosen. Because of this, always consult with your vet for help in determining the amount of feed as the bag recommendations are not accurate for miniatures.

Category: Feeding Strategies for Senior Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have older horses, there are a lot of different options for feeding them and your veterinarian can help.  Dental disease is common in older horses and a special feed may be required for them.  However, just because your horse is older does not automatically indicate they need to be on a senior or special feed.  It depends on the teeth, which needs to be determined by your vet after a thorough exam.  Many older horses will maintain their weight on just pasture and hay with a vitamin mineral supplement.  Also, you have to take in consideration the horse’s other medical issues if there are any.  For example, if your horse is insulin resistant or has Cushing’s disease, then you need to take that into account when choosing a feed as well.  You would not want a senior feed that is high in carbohydrates as this could lead to laminitis and founder.  Also, significant dental disease may require that your horse is on a diet with no long fibers because long fibers given to a horse that has difficulty chewing could lead to esophageal obstruction, commonly known as choke.  Some older horses cannot chew well enough to feed even short-chopped fibers and need to be given a complete ration that does not require foraging. Again, you cannot just pick a diet that satisfies this requirement, but you must look at the horse’s overall health and take all factors into consideration.  Many older horses have a difficult time consuming enough calories due to dental issues and will lose weight.  Feeding increased carbohydrates is not a good option for most horses due to the concern with laminitis developing so feeding an increased fat ration may be helpful.  However, we don’t want older horses to be too heavy due to the arthritis that is a common problem in aged horses.

Category: Feeding Your Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An important question I ask every horse owner when doing a wellness exam on each horse is what are you feeding and how much. I usually get a good answer on what they are feeding but how much is a different story. The most common answer I hear, for example, is that they are giving one can or two scoops twice a day. Of course the concern is that a can or scoop tells the veterinarian nothing because we do not know how much the can or scoop actually holds. Plus, different feeds vary in weight, so even if you weigh a scoop of one feed, if you change feeds you need to weigh the new feed. Weighing is important because current recommendations are never to feed over 5 pounds of grain at one feeding. Many folks do this and do not realize it. It has been shown that feeding more than 5 pounds at each feeding increases the chance of colic. Also, it is important for your vet to know how many pounds you are feeding if your horse is too fat or too thin. This will help your vet when making recommendations for feeding. If your horse is too thin and you are already feeding 5 pounds of grain per feeding, then other options for weight gain should be considered. On the other hand, if your horse is thin and you are only feeding 2 pounds of grain per feeding, then you can safely increase the amount of grain. Plus, all of the recommendations on the feed bags for how much to give are going to be in pounds per day. So if you do not know how many pounds of feed you are giving, take a bathroom scale with you to the barn and weigh your feed and scoop. And when your vet asks how much you are feeding, you will surprise them by being ready with an answer.

Category: Feeds High in Starch Cause Inflammation in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A recent study out of Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas, showed high starch meals can lead to inflammation, and feeds high in starch are not recommended for some horses, increasing the level of interleukin 1b, a potent inflammatory maker. The publication The Horse said that this study found both overweight and older horses had higher levels of interleukin 1 b after consuming diets high in starch. The study involved two trials, and in the first trial, researchers divided middle-aged horses into two groups, those with normal weight and those that were overweight. The horses were fed the same diet including, hay and steam-rolled barley. On day 14, they checked blood samples and found overweight horses had an immediate increase in interleukin while the normal weight horses only had increases in interleukin after 14 days. Overweight horses were affected the quickest, but even normal horses had an increase in systemic inflammation following high starch diets. The second trial involved two groups of horses aged 12-14 years old and 20-23 years old. Both groups were fed steam-rolled barley, hay, and a concentrate. After 36 days, blood testing revealed older horses had higher levels of increased interleukin il-1b compared to the younger horses. These trials showed older and overweight horses had increased systemic inflammation compared to younger and fit horses. In humans, recent studies have shown that systemic inflammation like that caused by interleukin can cause neuroinflammation as is found with Alzheimer’s disease. Neuroinflammation is described as the brain's protective response to an inflammatory issue or challenge. Based on this study, feeding a high starch diet if your horse is overweight or is older is not recommended. Check with your veterinarian about your horse’s nutritional needs.

Category: Flavoring Water Can Increase Water Consumption in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The old saying you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make them drink is literally true, but there are some things you can do to encourage drinking. Dehydration is a major cause of problems in horses and is commonly encountered in equine practice.  Although dehydration can be caused by many factors, colic is a common problem either causing or leading to dehydration. Various products have been added to the water to attempt to increase water consumption but until recently no studies had been performed to determine the most effective addition to encourage water consumption. The veterinarians at Washington State University performed a study to determine which additive encouraged water consumption. They used commercial sweet feed flavored electrolyte, peppermint extract flavored electrolyte, and apple flavored electrolyte. Results showed some evidence that commercial sweet feed and peppermint flavoring added to water did increase water consumption. The addition of commercial flavored sweet feed to the water was more effective than peppermint flavored water.  Interestingly, horses actually consumed less water after adding an apple flavored electrolyte solution to the water compared to drinking plain water.  So, if you have a horse that will not drink, adding a small amount of commercial sweet feed just to flavor the water may be helpful.

Category: Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance in Endurance Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A major concern with endurance horses is dehydration and electrolyte balance. During the ride, a veterinarian will examine all horses to determine if the horses are healthy enough to continue the event. Drs. Juli Flaminio and Bonnie Rush indicate inVeterinary Clinics of North Americathat clinical signs compatible with metabolic disturbances include dry, pale, or congested mucous membranes. Also, increased capillary refill time is common, and this can be checked by pressing on your horse's gums and removing your finger, then timing how long it takes for the pink color to return. Anything over 2 ½ seconds is abnormal. Loss of skin elasticity also occurs with dehydration; this can be checked by picking up the skin on the shoulder and releasing it, and the skin should immediately return to normal. If the skin remains tented for a period of time, dehydration is likely. A lack of urination and especially sweating indicates possible dehydration and many of these horses have decreased intestinal sounds, increased respiratory rate and an increased temperature usually related to a lack of sweating. Also, many horses will have poor performance, depression, abnormal heart rhythm and faster heart rate than normal. The combination of dehydration, shock from low fluid volume, electrolyte imbalance and energy depletion leads to the exhausted horse syndrome. Without treatment, other symptoms that can occur include colic, laminitis, seizures, collapse and even death. Treatment of compromised horses involves intravenous or oral fluid therapy as well as electrolytes. Administration of water only without electrolytes can actually cause other problems and is not recommended.

Category: Grazing Muzzles Can Decrease Pasture Consumption
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Obesity is a serious problem in horses as in some cases it can lead to laminitis and founder.  Laminitis is a painful foot condition that can even end in the horse’s death in some cases.  It is difficult to get horses to lose weight and still get them exercise as most horses gain weight from eating grass in the pasture, not from grain or concentrates.  Exercise is really important to aid in weight loss. Also, horses generally have a better mental attitude in a pasture versus being kept in a stall. However, unless you have a large area fenced with no grass, turnout can be difficult but one option is a grazing muzzle.  A grazing muzzle has been shown to decrease grass ingestion by 30-80%, depending on the grass and muzzle used.  The major problem my clients have is keeping the muzzle on the horse as some horses are really good at getting the muzzle off and some muzzles are certainly better than others.  The muzzle allows the horse to get some grass inside the muzzle but prevents a large portion from being eaten. Dr. Amy Burk was concerned about the mental stress the muzzle could cause, so she developed a study using six miniature horses that were in adjacent grass paddocks 24 hours a day.  They rotated two Minis at a time through three 21-day treatment periods: no muzzle, muzzled for 10 hours per day, and muzzled for 24 hours per day. Miniature horses were used because they commonly are obese and need to lose weight.  The horses were recorded hourly and their weights were checked routinely.  Heart rate and salivary cortisol levels were also measured to check for stress.  The results showed that no negative effects occurred.  Minis muzzled for 24 hours showed no evidence of stress and lost weight compared to other groups that gained weight so if your horse is overweight, a grazing muzzle is an option to consider and still keep your horse in the pasture.

Category: Hay and Asthma in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine asthma is a term now used to include several respiratory diseases.  Inflammatory airway disease is a common condition in performance horses, and it is now called mild to moderate equine asthma, whereas recurrent airway obstruction is now called severe equine asthma.  Recurrent airway obstruction was also once called COPD or heaves. These name changes make everything confusing.  There is also a summer pasture-associated airway obstruction syndrome in grazing horses that is now part of the equine asthma syndrome.  I think that placing all of these diseases under asthma is more confusing as they are all different to some degree and this makes it more difficult to describe them. Regardless, all of these diseases cause inflammation in the lungs. All except the pasture-associated disease is related to barn confinement and the higher amount of hay dust and other particles inhaled, as well as higher concentrations ammonia found in a stall.  To determine the amount of particles ingested, a study was performed in which horses were fitted with instruments around the nostrils to sample the air that they breathe. Results indicated that inflammatory airway disease is due to hypersensitivity to inhaled allergens.  Many times hay nets are used in stalls to assist feeding and to slow the eating process, which helps alleviate boredom.  However, the researchers found a four-fold higher dust exposure in horses eating from hay nets inside the stall.  Horses eating hay from nets essentially keep their noses in the hay the entire time, which they do not do when fed off the ground.  So if you have a horse with respiratory disease, feeding hay off the ground may be a better option than feeding from a hay net, especially if the horse is fed in a stall.

Category: Hay Damaged by Rain for Horses and Cattle
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Damage occurs when your hay is cut and rained on before you are able to bale it. Dr. Brian Pugh of Oklahoma State Extension indicates at cattlenetwork.com that hay that has been cut and rained on can lose quality in four ways. The first is 1) leaching of soluble carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals, 2) increased plant respiration, 3) leaf shattering and finally 4) microbial breakdown of plant tissue. Leaching of carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals is usually at its highest when the hay has already dried some and then a prolonged rain occurs. Rainfall right after cutting usually results in less leaching of nutrients and a small shower has very little effect on leaching of nutrients at all. Increased or prolonged respiration occurs when hay is not allowed to dry sufficiently to stop the plant’s metabolic processes. The hay must be at less than 30 percent moisture for respiration to be reduced to acceptable levels and hay that is green when rained on will continue to respire for long periods, decreasing the quality and yield of the hay. Increasing leaf shatter occurs with hay that has been rained on because more mechanical handling of the hay is required to dry it. Increased raking tends to shatter leaves from the stems and since more of the nutrient is in the leaves, raking and baling can reduce the quality of the hay substantially. Hay lying on the ground can be consumed by organisms that lead to loss of dry matter and yield. One study indicated cut hay can lose 5 percent of dry matter per inch of rain, so if you have some hay that received substantial rain after cutting, it is a good idea to send the hay off to a lab for analysis so you can determine its quality.

Category: Hay Replacement Options for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In times of severe heat and drought, hay is hard to find and expensive. Lots of clients call our office about options for feeding their horses using different types of hay or buying complete feeds that require no hay at all. Dr. Randel Raub at Purina Mills indicates in The Horse Magazine that a complete feed is one that can be fed without hay; it provides adequate amounts and types of fiber because the forage or hay component is built in. The complete feed should also supply all the protein, vitamins, and minerals required in the diet with no other supplementation. You cannot determine what is a complete feed and what is not by looking at fiber amounts on the bag. The fiber in complete feeds must be less digestible so the feed can be fed at a higher rate. The lesser digestible forage might be a concern when you hear this term but it is necessary to mimic a more natural forage as if the horse was out grazing. A complete feed is needed when a horse is unable to graze or chew, hay is unavailable, or if a horse has respiratory disease and reacts to dust or pollen in hay. Complete feeds are to be fed in large quantities. You should not give a horse more than 5 pounds of feed per feeding, so it is recommended to provide complete feeds three to four times daily. You may find a complete feed is just as economical as feeding hay and grain but it is important to do the math and determine the least expensive feeding plan. Personally, I feel it is better to feed hay if at all possible and avoid complete feeds. Feeding small amounts of hay every few hours is better for digestion and keeps the horse from getting bored.

Category: Hay Storage Tips
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English South Dakota State Extension Service provided some hay storage tips at beefproducer.com that may help protect your investment in hay. Dr. Karla Hernandez indicates hay storage losses are around 5% when hay is harvested at 15% moisture and stored under dry conditions. However, nutrients can be lost if hay is not stored properly and can occur if moisture exceeds 20%. Every step in the process from cutting to baling to hauling can lead to loss, and a lot of these losses are mechanical or weather related. Round bales have increased losses compared to square bales because they are usually stored outside and are uncovered. You can decrease spoilage by making the bale denser, and the density of round bales should be a minimum of 10 pounds of hay per cubic foot. When making windrows for baling, attempt to make uniform size windrows and match the size of the windrows to the specific recommendation of the bailer you are using.A uniform windrow allows a uniform bale and a denser bale. Also, it may be worth considering erecting a pole barn or similar structure to store round bales; the money saved by decreasing losses may be enough to pay for the barn. As far as storing bales, large round bales should be stored in rows with the sides not touching to avoid a higher amount of moisture in them. Dr. Hernandez recommends that rows of round bales should be lined up north to south to allow more hours of exposure of the round bales' sides to the sun. When lining up round bales in a row, allow a minimum of 3 feet between rows to allow sunlight to penetrate and air to circulate. Hay is expensive and hopefully by using these tips, you can avoid some of the common losses of hay.

Category: Hay Waste for Horses Affected by Feeders
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The cost of hay is high cost but there are methods to decrease hay waste. A paper in the Journal of Equine Veterinary Science out of the University of Minnesota indicated that hay waste was much greater when hay was fed on the stall floor rather than in a feeder, so using a feeder is really important. However, there are differences in feeders. The ones tested were basket feeders, hayracks, and slat feeders, and these were compared to not using a hay feeder at all and to feeding hay on the ground. Horses fed using no feeder at all wasted 13 percent of their hay so if you are not using a feeder for feeding square bales, you are wasting a lot of hay. Horses fed in slat feeders only wasted one percent of their hay, while horses fed out of basket and hay rack feeders wasted three percent and five percent respectively. Basically, the feeders that provided less access also had less waste of the hay. Although the slat feeder has the lowest amount of waste, it also decreased the horse's consumption of the hay due to limited access. Feeding without a feeder decreased the amount of hay consumed because of the amount of hay lost as waste. So overall, less feed was consumed using a slat feeder or no feeder, and these horses lost weight. In comparison, horses fed hat out of the basket feeder and hayrack feeders resulted in an increase in hay intake, a slight increase in body weight, and decreased waste. So if you are not using a feeder for your horse, you need to do so. The basket type feeders or hay racks will allow your horse to ingest more of their hay while wasting less of this expensive feed.

Category: High Potassium Levels in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Potassium is an electrolyte that is necessary for multiple body functions as well as other actions. If the potassium level in the blood gets too high major complications can occur, and if high enough it can be deadly. The kidney filters excessive potassium that is excreted in the urine, but if the kidneys are failing less potassium is excreted. Also, most of the potassium in the body is inside the cells but certain conditions can cause potassium to leave the cell and be in the circulation, which can increase the potassium in the blood stream and cause problems. High potassium can lead to increased muscular contraction resulting in cramping, and also can have severe effects on the heart. The staff at Kentucky Equine Research indicates that clinical signs noted with a high potassium level include muscle weakness, trembling, depression, lethargy and a change in the heart rhythm, specifically a very slow heart rate. Some horses are more susceptible to increased potassium levels and these are horses with HYPP or hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. HYPP is a genetic muscle disease that was first recognized in quarter horse studs and it is believed 4 percent of the quarter horses are currently affected. Most of these horses show symptoms before 3 years of age. While some horses just have muscle twitching, others may have severe muscle cramping, staggering; some horses will go down and be unable to rise. Some horses can have paralyzed respiratory muscles as well as the muscles in the throat, and those will not survive. Treating increased potassium levels, regardless of the reason, is by using intravenous calcium to protect the heart and intravenous glucose to lower the potassium level.

Category: High-Starch Diets and Horse Reactivity
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English I often hear from horse owners that a high-protein diet makes their horse hot or too reactive. It is important to realize that protein is a poor source of energy so it is not the high protein but the high-energy in a diet that may cause the horse to behave differently. The most common energy sources for the horse are starches and fat. A recent study done in England tried to determine if a high-starch diet resulted in changed behavior compared to horses fed a high-fiber diet. The study involved eight mature horses. One group was fed a high-starch diet consisting of grain plus hay for 28 days, and the other group was fed a high-fiber diet with hay and alfalfa. After 28 days, the rations were switched for another 28 days. Horses were evaluated once weekly. Results found horses on the high-starch diet had higher than average heart rates during handling. Also, horses on the high-starch diet showed more interruptions in eating than those on the high-fiber diet when an unfamiliar object was presented while they were eating. High heart rates can indicate fear or excitement and this is what many people consider making their horse hot. So it is possible that feeding high-starch diets could make your horse hot, but not high-protein diets. Also, horses are designed to eat forage as their major source of food, not grain. We feed grain because we ask them to compete athletically but a better plan is to feed mostly hay and only feed enough grain for extra calories. An even better option is to increase your horse's energy by feeding fat instead of starch because it is safer and less likely to make your horse hot.

Category: Horse Feed, When is it Too Old to Use
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When we buy our own food, most of the products have an expiration date or a best-by date. Most of the better dog foods have an expiration date or best-by date also, but Kentucky Equine Research indicates that horse feeds are not required to have these dates on the label. Many will have the manufacturing date on them and some may have a best-by date, but it is not mandatory. It is difficult to determine the significance of a best-by date because the storage of horse feed is sometimes in less than desirable environments and this will affect the best-by date. Therefore, horse feed may not still be okay to feed up until the best-by date depending on the environment where it is stored. Products maintained in a cool, low humidity, and pest-free environment may be okay to feed after the best-by date while those stored in a hot barn in heat and humidity may not be good to feed even up to the best-by date. Extruded feeds probably have a longer shelf life than sweet feeds containing molasses. Regardless, it is best to store feed in a cool low humidity environment, which is difficult in hot and humid climates. Placing feed bags in containers off the ground helps rodent and insect infestation. Another important issue is feeding corn straight out of the field. Corn is a great feed source for horses but it can contain a fungus that produces a poison called fumonisin. This poison causes moldy corn poisoning and it is almost always deadly, so it is never a good idea to feed corn to a horse unless it has been tested; all of the major feed companies test their corn before including it in the feed. So if you are using a product containing corn for your horses, make sure the corn is tested, and never feed corn directly out of the field.

Category: Increase Horse's Water Consumption in the Winter
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although horses sweat during the summer and need to drink more water, we see more problems occurring in the winter with horses not drinking enough water. The weather is cold and horses don't believe they need to drink, so they have decreased water consumption and mild dehydration. Mild dehydration causes dry areas to develop in the intestine, causing decreased intestinal function, and this combination can lead to impaction colic. To encourage a horse to drink you have to know what stimulates thirst and Dr. Clair Thunes with Summit Animal Nutrition indicates that high concentrations of sodium in the blood stimulate thirst. Sodium is just one of the three most important electrolytes in horses and the other two are potassium and chloride. An 1100-pound horse requires 10 grams of sodium, 25 grams potassium and 40 grams chloride per day. Forage is the basis of the horse's diet and forage is a really good source of potassium but not a good source of sodium. Many owners give their horse salt blocks but most horses will not ingest enough salt from a block. For a horse to get 10 grams of sodium, they need to eat about two tablespoons of table salt. You can purchase commercial electrolyte products but many of these contain a large amount of sugar and in these cases, there may not be enough chloride to satisfy the horse's requirements. In many cases, you can provide these electrolytes much less expensively and just as effectively by adding to your horse's ration two tablespoons of regular table salt and one tablespoon of lite salt twice daily.

Category: Is Your Horse Fat?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many domestic animals and people are overweight and horses are no different.  However, a recent study mentioned in The Horse magazine indicated that most people do not see their horses as overweight even if that is the case.  The Swiss study involved 51 leisure horses. The researchers visited the horses and owners at their homes and asked about the horses’ weight.  They were asked to rate their horse on a scale from 1-6 with 6 being obese, and the researchers used the same scale.  There was a notable discrepancy between the owners’ and researchers’ scores as over 27% of the horses were overweight and had a score of at least 5.  However, none of the horse owners scored their horses higher than a 5 so the owners underestimated the body condition of their horses. One interesting side note was that the body condition of the owner had no correlation to the body condition of the horses, as thinner people had just as many overweight horses as did overweight people.  It was found that some breeds were more genetically susceptible to being overweight and are easy keepers by using food more efficiently.  Of course, we have to realize this is an issue with some breeds and watch their diets more closely.  For this reason, it is important for your vet to perform a twice yearly exam on your horse. The number one concern with obesity in horses is laminitis and founder, which are much easier conditions to prevent than to treat, so if your horse is overweight you can take steps to decrease the weight before symptoms occur.  Your vet can give you recommendations for feeding and exercise but basically, if your horses are overweight, take them off pasture and feed a diet consisting of less than 10% nonstructural carbohydrates, which are basically simple sugars such as grains, green grass, and high-carb hays (hay can be tested for nonstructured carbohydrate levels).

Category: Long Stem vs Short Stem Hay for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English You have probably heard about feeding long stem or short stem hay to your horses but may not be familiar with the meaning.  Emily Smith with Platinum Performance wants to remind horse owners that forage is the cornerstone of all equine diets. Forage is usually in the form of grass or hay.  Fresh grass is ideal as it contains about 80% water, which helps with intestinal function as a lot of colic cases may be related to the horse not drinking enough water.  Fresh grass generally provides an excellent blend of protein, fat, fiber, minerals and vitamins for your horse’s health.  Several nutrients including beta carotene, which is needed to make vitamin A as well as vitamins C, D, E and omega 3 fatty acids are lost in the baling process. With appropriate supplementation, long stem hay is the next best forage when fresh grass is not available.  Baled long stem hay is the most common form of hay and long stem refers to hay that is 2 inches or more in length. This long hay helps to keep the GI tract functioning properly.  Hay cubes and hay pellets are also available. Hay cubes are compressed cubes of chopped hay that may contain some long stems, but mostly is considered short stem hay.  Hay pellets are considered short stem hay and short stem hay requires less time chewing than long stem hay, and chewing time is important because chewing increases saliva production.  Saliva contains high levels of calcium and sodium bicarbonate to buffer gastric acid in the stomach and help prevent stomach ulcers.  Long stem hay takes longer to chew, which is similar to eating grass in the pasture, compared to short stem hay, which is eaten more rapidly. So unless your horse has a problem eating long stem hay, in most cases it is the best option for forage.

Category: Low Carb Diets for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have a horse that is overweight or has equine metabolic syndrome, you may have heard that your horse needs to be on a low-carb diet. However, Dr. Clair Thunes from Sacramento indicates in the Horse magazine that there are different types of carbohydrates and it is important for horse owners to know the difference. All horses need carbohydrates but there are two basic types: starch or sugars, such as glucose; and complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose, hemicellulos, pectins, and lignin. The complex carbohydrates are digested in the hindgut by bacteria and do not result in increased levels of insulin, whichare the cause of laminitis and founder. However, all forages contain some simple sugars and complex sugars so you have to make sure you are feeding forages that are low in starch and sugars that are also called non-structural carbohydrates. The problem with green lush pasture grass in the spring is that it is high in non-structural carbohydrates. We use to feel most cases of founder were related to feeding large amounts of grain or accidental ingestion of grain, and although this does occur, it is fairly rare. By far the most common cause of laminitis and founder is when horses that are susceptible to founder graze on lush spring pasture. So if you have a horse that is overweight or has equine metabolic syndrome, they cannot graze on lush spring pasture. Now this does not mean they cannot be turned out, but must be in a basic dry lot and fed low-starch hay and low-starch grain. It is not a good idea to stall these horses so fencing off an area that has no or very minimal grass is ideal. Some horses can use a grazing muzzle to decrease consumption of pasture grass, depending on the situation.

Category: Meals and the Horse's Intestinal Tract
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English I believe most horses are the healthiest when they are allowed to graze on grass and eat small amounts frequently. The horse's GI tract is designed for them to eat small meals frequently and so when they are fed one or two large meals daily, problems can develop. I know sometimes all you can do is feed once or twice daily, and not everyone has a turnout area. However, just realize this is abnormal for the horse's digestion. Kentucky Equine Research indicates in equinews.com that the horse's stomach holds about two to four gallons; it is not as large a stomach as you would expect for this size animal. And the stomach doesn't need to be that big because horses were not meant to eat large meals and therein lies the problem when we feed a horse a large meal once or twice a day. Normally, the food eaten passes out of the stomach in 30 minutes. Chewing causes saliva to be produced that, among other things, buffers the acid in the stomach. Horses continually produce acid in their stomach so if they are only fed once or twice a day, then saliva is only produced at those times and the rest of the time acid is sitting in the horse's stomach with no saliva to buffer it. So you can easily see why race horses that are fed only twice a day and are kept in a stall 23 hours a day develop stomach ulcers. Also, the hindgut of the horse is made to digest fiber rich foods like pasture, hay, and hay cubes. When large grain meals are fed, some of the grain by-passes the small intestine and ends up in the hindgut, which changes the bacteria in the intestine leading to colic, diarrhea, and behavioral issues like wood chewing and stall walking. So horses are designed to eat small meals of forage all through the day and the further we get away from that, the more problems we see.

Category: Monensin Poisoning in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Monensin is a feed additive used in cattle and poultry feeds to promote growth and although it is effective for its purpose in these species, it is highly toxic to horses.  Most cases of poisoning occur when a feed mill makes a mistake and monensin is added to horse feed instead of cattle feed.  However, toxicity can also occur when a horse breaks into a feed room and eats cattle or poultry feed containing it. Also, if a producer does not realize it is toxic and has a horse in the same pasture as cattle that are eating feed containing monensin, horses may be exposed. Erica Larson indicated at The Horse.com that monensin primarily affects the muscle cells of horses and can cause a loss of appetite, rapid or irregular heart rate, exercise intolerance, sweating, colic and even death.  Some horses that consume monensin eventually recover and return to their previous level of performance and it all depends on the amount consumed.  A concern is that since the heart is a muscle, it has not been shown how monensin affects equine hearts that survived so Dr. Clementine Gy from the University of Montreal did a study on affected horses.  She looked at 76 horses exposed to monensin that were in the acute phase of exposure in the last 2 weeks, horses that were exposed 15-45 days prior, and horses 4-10 months after exposure.  With a stress test, ultrasound and electrocardiogram, she found heart abnormalities in all horses recently exposed, 65% of those exposed 15-45 days ago, and 44% had heart abnormalities even at 4-10 months.  At 16 months after exposure, only 50% of the horses had returned to their previous function.  So, if your horse is exposed to monensin, call your vet immediately and provide rest for your horse.

Category: Nutrition for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most common problems that occurs in horses is gastric or stomach ulcers.  One reason is that although saliva is a buffer that increases the pH in the horse’s stomach to protect the stomach from the gastric acid that causes ulcers, horses only produce saliva when they chew but they can produce stomach acid 24 hours a day.  So, this works great for horses that are out in pasture grazing all day, but is a problem for horses that are fed only twice a day with no turnout.  This is why 90% of the racehorses have ulcers:  horses were designed to eat small meals over the majority of the day and not to be stalled and fed large amounts twice a day. As far as the horse’s stomach, the stomach of a mature 1100-pound horse can hold about 2 to 4 gallons of fluid. and food can be retained in the stomach for 1 to 5 hours depending on the type and consistency of it.  Treatments to prevent gastric ulcers include the drug omeprazole, and although it increases the pH by decreasing gastric acid, this is not without potential adverse effects.  The pH of the horse’s stomach is low to prevent bacteria from growing in the area and if you increase the pH to prevent ulcers, the bacteria could proliferate and allow an infectious process to develop.  Also, using omeprazole can have an effect on calcium balance and increase the risk of fractures.  However, a 2015 study showed no difference on calcium levels and bone density after 60 days of treatment, but the study only lasted 60 days and involved compounded omeprazole that may not be effective. Considering the size of horses, they have a short, small intestine and do not have a gall bladder, so bile is continually produced for digesting fats.  However, they have a long and complicated large intestine, and in contrast to ruminants in which microbial fermentation occurs in the first section of the stomach, their microbial fermentation occurs in the large intestine.  A horse’s stomach is similar to a human’s in that regard. The Waltham Center in England says the foundation of a horse’s diet should be forage, and many horses do not need additional feed other than added vitamins and minerals.  Forage is not only important nutritionally but is necessary for normal function of the GI tract.  Horses that are on pasture 24 hours a day generally graze about 60% of the time, and most normal horses need about 1.5% of their body weight a day which in a 1000-pound horse would be about 15 pounds.  That 15 pounds includes hay and grass.  However, some ponies will consume up to 5% of their body weight per day in a 24-hour period and will consume 1% within the first 3 hours of turnout.  This is one reason many ponies are fat and develop laminitis and founder.  If a horse is stabled 24 hours a day, then 100% of their forage needs to come from hay but if they are out to pasture 4 to 8 hours per day, feed only 50-75% of calculated hay ration, and if out on pasture 8 to 12 hours a day, feed only 25-50% of the calculated hay ration.  If your horse is on pasture 24 hours a day, then feed less than 25% of the calculated hay ration depending on the quality of the pasture. Complementary feeds are those given to increase nutrition in horses that need some extra for work or pregnancy.  The veterinarians at Waltham Nutrition say that complementary feeds were considered to be high in energy and rich in cereal grain, but this is no longer the case.  Today’s complementary feeds deliver energy from a variety of sources ranging from high starch cereal grains to highly digestible fiber such as sugar beets.  Many of these feeds are supplemented with vegetable oil as a fat source and they also contain a vitamin and mineral supplement to balance the diet.  However, you have to give the recommended amount of feed, which is usually about 2 pounds per 1000 pounds of horse to meet the mineral requirements.  If the label recommends 2 pounds per day and you are only feeding 1 pound, you would need to add another supplement.  Ration balancers are also available that provide protein, vitamins and minerals if fed at the recommended amounts but do not provide energy, and this is a good option for those horses in light work that are on forage and you just need to balance the ration. Although it was common in the past to feed one cereal grain such as corn, when feeding a straight ration with only one ingredient you have to be careful because cereal grains are high in phosphorus and low in calcium while sugar beet pulp and alfalfa are high in calcium and low in phosphorus.  Feeding a straight ration with one ingredient can lead to an unbalanced ration and potentially cause disease.  For this reason, it is probably better to use a commercial feed that has been analyzed rather than trying to mix your own ingredients. Water is the most important nutrient in a horse’s diet. Normal water intake is required for normal function of all organs, especially the GI tract.

Category: Nutrition in Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Foal growth and development starts even before birth so proper nutrition of the mare is critical. Dr. Karen Davison from Purina Feed indicates foals are eating machines from birth and will nurse 70 or more times per day while consuming 30 pounds of milk per day during the first months of life. And this is a good thing because initially the mare's milk is the best feed for the foal, but mare's milk does decrease in nutrient content after the first month of lactation. After the first month, Dr. Davison believes foals require some supplementation for adequate nutrition and growth as foals who only have mare's milk after the first month will grow at a reduced rate. The ideal foal feed would consist of high quality and very digestible concentrated nutrition, as young foals can only eat a small amount at a time. A recommendation is to give a pound of dry foal feed per day per month of age, so a 2-month-old foal would be fed 2 pounds per day and a 3-month-old foal would be fed 3 pounds per day, assuming you are dealing with a normal, adult-size horse breed. Free choice creep feed is not a good idea because foals can become overweight. One concern with abnormal feeding is the possibility that the foal will develop an orthopedic disease. Many times foals are allowed to eat alongside with the mare and consume a ration balanced for the mare but not the foal. These foals do not grow as rapidly when nursing the mare and then when weaned are introduced to a ration for maximum growth. When on the new ration, the body will try to catch up and contracted tendons and other conditions can develop, so foals should be fed balanced rations from birth.

Category: Obese or "Pleasantly Plump" Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Evolutionarily, there are advantages to being a horse that “gets fat on air.” In fact, for centuries, in the heyday of the work horse, horses were selected for just this trait: the ability to maintain body condition and do heavy labor even when food was scant. They are thought of as easy keepers. Unfortunately, evolution is a slow process. While for the most part our horses no longer haul large wagons, pull plows, or function as the major source of transportation, their feed ‒ though subject to some whims of climate ‒ is largely abundant and affordable. The result is calorie-efficient animals housed in boxes or on irrigated and maintained pastures, fed nutrient-rich diets, and exercised for maybe a couple of hours per day. At the extreme end of energy conservation is the horse affected with equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). These horses appear to have some metabolic glitches including a propensity toward obesity and associated insulin resistance. Researchers investigating the possibility of a genetic component to EMS suspect that while genetics may play a role in EMS, most likely the expression is complex and has more than one gene involved. In other words, there probably isn’t an EMS on/off switch. Why do we care about EMS and obesity in horses, anyway? Isn’t a round croup (rump) a sign of a well-fed animal? While physicians and small animal veterinarians have done an exemplary job over the years counseling people and clients about overweight pets, a feedlot mentality still seems to persist in the horse industry. Despite broad marketing of new "low non-structural carbohydrate foods," horse owners still seem perpetually concerned that they are “underfeeding” their horses. Yet the consequences of obesity in horses are as severe as in any species, and in the case oflaminitis, rapidly disastrous. Horses who are overweight for any reason run a high risk of health problems. Overfed horses are being managed far outside their true needs. The horse is a grazer, designed to walk throughout the day and forage on a diet of mixed grasses. Feeding large quantities of alfalfa, hay, and concentrated feeds to a horse is like an all-you-can eat buffet for people; marathoners might be able to burn off buckets of pasta and fried chicken, but for most people it's too much food. For horses with EMS, a poorly regulated diet is closer to feeding a Type II diabetic that same pasta, fried chicken, and soft-serve ice cream feast. While EMS horses are not strictly diabetic as they don’t dump sugar into their urine, these horses do typically have difficulty properly processing sugars and their blood work is generally characterized by insulin resistance. This means that while the body does just fine at producing insulin, the receptors that wouldnormally help metabolize these sugars are not doing so well enough. In horses, this glitch in sugar processing often leads to another physiologic upset: the condition known as laminitis. Laminitis is an inflammatory condition of the lamellae, sensitive tissues that connect between the hoof wall and the coffin bone. When these lamellae become inflamed, several things can happen: 1. PainEver had an infected toenail? Ok, now say you weighed over 1000 pounds and your entire foot was that toe. Now, now make it both feet and drop something heavy on the feet. That's what laminitis feels like. 2. Physiologic stress. Chronic pain causes cortisol release, which makes the animal more susceptible to infection, among other things. Also, horses with severe laminitis spend a lot of time lying down. However, even humans can get bedsores and muscle damage from lying in place for too long, and most of us don’tweigh half a ton or more. If your horse has EMS, is obese, has laminitis, cut back on the grain and consider switching from alfalfa to grass hay. Give your horse more exercise. But what if the horse isn't just pleasantly plump and still has EMS? First, only your veterinarian can help you determine the cause of your horse’s weight or health issues. Talk to her about your horse’s body condition. Ask her to teach you how to measure your horse’s body condition score so that you can better monitor his weight. Also ask for tips on nutrition and feeding. If you have an overweight horse with a history of laminitis, ask about followup care. Chances are your veterinarian may recommend restricting pasture access and feeding a low non-structural carbohydrate diet. Remember that prevention is most of the battle when dealing with EMS and EMS-associated laminitis. Once a horse develops laminitis, it is too late; damage is permanent.

Category: Older Horses Digestibility
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today I am going to talk about digestion of nutrients in older horses. In humans, nutritional requirements change with age, but there is not a lot of information about the changes in digestion as horses age. One older study indicated that geriatric horses have decreased digestion of phosphorus, fiber, and crude protein. It is possible these horses had parasites and may have also had dental disease, as this was not discussed in the study. Due to the lack of current information, a recent study was performed on 17 stock-type mares ranging in age from five to 28 years old. Each horse was dewormed, had no significant dental disease, and was fed three different diets consisting of hay only; hay plus a starch and sugar-rich concentrate; and hay plus a fat and fiber-rich concentrate. Each diet was fed for five weeks and feces and urine was evaluated to determine digestibility. Kentucky Equine research indicates that the study found older horses in good health can absorb nutrients as well as younger horses. There was no difference in digestibility of energy, neutral detergent fiber, crude protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus. So results of this study lead us to believe that there is no reason to change diets as a horse ages. This is assuming the horse has good dentition because if he has dental problems with missing and cupped out teeth, then a senior diet may be beneficial. The senior diets require less chewing so when your veterinarian is performing your horse's semi-annual exam, ask them to check your horse's teeth, check for parasites, and discuss the diet they recommend for your horse. You may not need to change diets just because your horse is getting older.

Category: Omega 3 Fatty Acid Use in Allergic Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When the weather is warm, the number of flying insects increases and many horses are allergic to their bites.  Horses that are allergic to insect bites have a significant reaction that causes them to scratch and rub their skin, and they are very uncomfortable.  Some will do enough damage to lose hair and even develop severe skin infections. All of this is commonly called sweat itch.  The lesions commonly occur on the midline of the horse’s belly but can occur over the back as well as the main and tail areas.  Treatment requires insect control, sometimes cortisone to decrease the allergic response, and antibiotics if there is an infection.  However, cortisone can only be used short term as it can lead to founder, so it is not a good option in the long term. Another option for the allergy may be omega 3 fatty acid supplementation.  This therapy is used in dogs for allergy and researchers at the University of Guelph indicated they tested horses using flaxseed, which is a good source of omega 3 fatty acids.  Horses were fed flax meal daily for six weeks. Then some of them were injected with Culicoides extract, which is one of the flies typically involved with the syndrome.  The horses that were fed the flax meal had a significant reduction in skin reaction compared to horses that were not given the flax.  So if your horse has skin allergies to flying insects, feeding omega 3 fatty acids may help.  The only concern I have about the study is that the horses used were not reported to be allergic to flying insects so although the itching decreased, i do not know if feeding flax seed will make a significant difference in itching horses but it is worth a try.

Category: Omega 3 Fatty Acids Affect a Horse's Insulin Sensitivity
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Omega 3 fatty acids are commonly used in animals and humans as a supplement for various disease conditions. In dogs, they have been shown to be effective for arthritis and skin conditions. The omega 3 fatty acids are commonly fed to horses to help with skin conditions, especially allergies. Fatty acids have been shown to increase the sensitivity of insulin in pigs. Insulin resistance is a major problem in horses because it causes metabolic syndrome, laminitis and founder. Horses that develop equine metabolic syndrome and founder are resistant to the effects of insulin and, if effective, feeding fatty acids would help prevent laminitis in these horses. Veterinarians at Colorado State tested omega 3 fatty acids to see if this supplement would help increase the sensitivity of insulin. To test this theory, a group of horses were fed both a marine source of omega 3 fatty acids containing fish oil and a plant source of omega 3 fatty acids consisting of flax seeds. Results indicated that insulin-resistant horses had a trend toward increased insulin sensitivity while there was no effect on horses that were not insulin resistant. Overall, there was no consistent effect in feeding fatty acid supplements to increase insulin sensitivity in horses. It is possible the lack of effect in the study could have been related to other factors because horses lost weight during the study, and weight loss also affects insulin sensitivity. The authors indicate that further study of insulin-resistant horses is necessary to determine if larger doses of omega 3 fatty acids may have an effect on increasing insulin sensitivity. However, at this time omega 3 fatty acids should not be considered to make a major difference in insulin sensitivity in horses.

Category: Oral Joint Supplements in Senior Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are literally hundreds of oral joint supplements on the market for horses. If you look at a horse magazine, it seems about half of the ads are for joint supplements and all claim to be the best. Marketing of these products is crazy, and they all have testimonials from successful horse folks and theories about why your horse has to have their product. In reality, only a few of these products are actually backed by scientific studies supporting their claims, and scientific studies have proven that about only 10% of these products actually contain the ingredients they list on the label. You may be wondering how this is possible because aren't all products required to be tested? Unfortunately, they are not, and these oral joint supplements are listed as feed supplements instead of drugs so the FDA does not regulate them. And then the other question is do these oral joint supplements really work as the advertisements say they do? To answer this question, researchers at the University of Utrecht tested the effectiveness of one oral joint supplement to see if it improved gait stiffness in older horses over a three-month period. The researchers took 24 older horses and divided them into two groups. Only one group was given the supplement. The supplement contained glucosamine, chondroitin and MSM. Results indicated there was no significant improvement is stride length, knee flexion, fetlock extension, or hock range of motion. This does not mean that all of the joint supplements do not help horses. It does indicate, however, that it is best to ask the manufacturer for scientific proof rather than relying on testimonials.

Category: Overweight Ponies Should Work for Food
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most common problems large animal veterinarians see is overweight horses, ponies and donkeys. Many of these animals develop laminitis and founder, painful foot conditions that can end in euthanasia, so weight loss is critical for these animals. Most of these animals are overweight because they are eating grass that is too high in carbohydrates. You have to change the diet but exercise has also been shown to increase weight loss, so if the animal is not already foundered and too painful to walk, exercise can be helpful. However, it is difficult to exercise donkeys and ponies because many of them cannot be ridden like horses. Plus, most owners do not have the time to hand-walk donkeys and ponies, but an Australia group came up with a novel exercise plan by using food as a means to stimulate activity. Researchers in Australia developed a novel dynamic feeding device and studied to see if exercise alone would decrease body fat. The study involved eight mixed-breed, overweight ponies that were fed alfalfa and a vitamin mineral supplement. The ponies were housed in a dry lot with custom-made feeders that alternatively opened on opposite sides of the pens for five minutes at a time. The team collected data on the amount of exercise the ponies performed by GPS technology when walking to eat. When the feeder was turned on, the ponies walked for almost 2 hours more twice daily, which significantly decreased their body weight and body fat percentage. This study shows that a low carb diet and consistent low-intensity exercise associated with a dynamic feeding system can lead to weight loss and improve insulin sensitivity. Or, instead of walking your dog every day, walk your overweight pony as doing so could prevent founder.

Category: Preventing Enteroliths in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An unusual type of colic in horses is due to a large stone called an enterolith that forms in the intestine and can partially or completely block it. Colic is common in horses; Kentucky Equine Research indicates part of the reason it's common is that horses have over 100 feet of intestine coiled up in the abdomen in a fairly small space that doesn't allow much expansion. Any significant enlargement of the intestine is likely to be painful, which causes colic symptoms. Nutrition plays an important role in colic and it is especially involved in horses that develop enterolith stones in the intestine. Enteroliths are stones made up of chemicals in the intestine under certain circumstances and although the cause is not completely known, we know there are several factors that increase the risk of enteroliths forming in the intestine and one of those is feeding alfalfa hay. We don't see a lot of enteroliths in Texas and this may be because we don't feed as much alfalfa as other states. Other factors that contribute to the formation of enteroliths include the fact that certain breeds like Arabians are more prone to develop the condition. Plus, spending less than 50 percent of their time outdoors, and lack of pasture grazing, also increases the chance of developing enteroliths. Increased levels of magnesium, nitrogen and calcium as well as a high pH of the colon contribute to enterolith formation, and alfalfa contributes to all of these factors. The stones form around any object the horse may have ingested, including a small rock, nail, coin, metal fragment, cloth or piece of a rope. So if you have a horse that has a history of developing enteroliths, feeding grass hay may be a better option than alfalfa.

Category: Preventing Founder in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We see a large number of horses in our practice that are overweight and although some of these horses are overfed, most have a syndrome called equine metabolic syndrome. Horses with equine metabolic syndrome were in the past called easy keepers because they gained weight and stayed fat with very little feed. At that point no one knew why this occurred but now we know that these horses are resistant to the effects of insulin. Because of this resistance, horses increase the production of insulin, and increased insulin is why these horses develop laminitis and founder. Insulin levels can be measured and if they are increased, treatment is initiated by decreasing non-structural carbohydrates in the ration. Horses should be fed hay. A 1,000-pound horse should receive about 15 pounds per day. Ideally, the hay should be tested to make sure it is less than 10% nonstructural carbohydrates. Soaking hay in water can decrease the carbohydrates, and that, is a good idea but we recommend testing the hay after it is soaked to see if it is really below the 10% level. If not, it should not be fed to horses with equine metabolic syndrome. These horses should also be fed either a vitamin mineral supplement that contains vitamin E or a low-carbohydrate feed designed for horses with equine metabolic syndrome. Because a horse's major source of carbohydrates is pasture, most of these horses will need very restricted time in the pasture or have pasture eliminated altogether. And since it takes a while for horses to lose weight and we are concerned about horses foundering before they lose weight, giving horses a thyroid supplement can increase insulin sensitivity and aid in weight loss.

Category: Putting Weight on a Skinny Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Getting a skinny horse to gain weight is not a common topic for veterinarians as most horses - as well as dogs and cats - are too heavy. However, there is the occasional horse that needs to gain weight, and Kentucky Equine Research has some ideas on how to increase their weight. There are lots of reasons why a horse may be skinny including parasites, infection, cancer, dental disease, and just not getting enough good feed to eat. There are three major energy sources for horses: fiber, starch and fat. Fiber is the most important as it is the major component of grass and hay. Many horses can maintain their weight on forage alone but hard keepers generally cannot do so. We call those horses that have a difficult time keeping weight on hard keepers, in contrast to those that get fat on very little feed, which are called easy keepers. Fresh spring grass has higher digestible fiber and higher energy than does parched summer grass and grass hay that has very little stem and more leaves provides more energy than hay with a lot of stems. Starch is the next ingredient and grain is the most common source of starch. Feeding grain is helpful in adding weight because it is more calorie dense than fibrous. However, feeding too much grain can lead to starch overload, colic and founder. Fat is an excellent energy source and has much more energy per weight than fiber or grain and is safer than feeding grain. It is important to notice I have not included protein; although protein is important, it is a poor source of energy. So if you have a thin horse, buying a high protein feed is not going to be helpful.

Category: Ration Analysis Begins with a Complete Forage Analysis for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We have discussed the critical need for forage or hay in the horses ration and mentioned a horse should get a minimum of 1% of the horse's body weight per day in long stem hay. For a 1,000-pound horse, this would be a minimum of 10 lbs hay per day. You should use a good quality hay that provides adequate nutrients. So how do you know the actual amounts of nutrients in the ration you are feeding and if the ration is adequate for your horse? To determine this information, a ration analysis must be performed. Amy Gill, an equine nutritionist, recommends beginning the ration analysis with a complete forage analysis. If possible, it is a good idea to buy large quantities of hay at a time so the hay will be from the same cutting and the analysis of all the hay will be the same. Also, you can have a hay analysis performed before the purchase is made. If smaller quantities of hay must be purchased, chose someone that has their hay analyzed and will provide the analysis results. The forage analysis should provide the following values: digestible energy, crude protein, percent dry matter, percent acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber, percent crude fat, percent calcium, sulfur, and phosphorus, as well as other vitamins and trace minerals. The percent acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber is a method of determining the maturity of the hay. If these values are too high, a hay belly can develop due to a large amount of indigestible fiber in the hay. However, if this percentage is too low, the horse will not receive enough roughage. The ration can then be balanced for the specific horses being fed depending on their age, weight, and use. After the forage analysis, it can be determined if the ration should be supplemented to meet a specific horse's requirements. Contact your veterinarian for help with a ration analysis for your horses.

Category: Round Bale Hay Storage
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Some horse owners and most cattle producers use round bales as a source of forage, especially in the winter. As I drive around and see all of these round bales stored on the ground, I wonder if the hay owners realize how much hay they are losing by storing round bales in this manner. To answer this question, Brad Holmes at the University of Wisconsin performed a study looking at various methods of hay storage and calculated the loss with each method. Holmes is an agricultural engineer. He stored the hay using several different methods, including under a roof, plastic wrap or bale sleeve on the ground, covered hay using a rock pad, uncovered hay using a rock pad, uncovered on the ground using a net wrap, covered on the ground, and finally uncovered on the ground. Certainly covering the hay under a roof was one of the best methods as losses of hay only approached 10%. However, wrapping the bales with plastic or a bale sleeve provided similar results. Covering the hay and placing it on a rock pad did have some increase in loss over hay stored under a roof, up to about 17%, but covering the hay was the main difference. Hay bales that were not covered but stored on a rock pad still had up to 46% loss of hay and now we are getting into losses that really make a difference. Surprisingly, uncovered hay on the ground with a net wrap only had losses of 25% while hay covered on the ground had losses up to 46%. The most losses occurred with uncovered hay on the ground, which had losses of over 60% of the hay. Even with a 50% loss, your hay is actually costing twice as much as you paid for it per bale and you could probably build a barn to store the hay with the amount of money lost in hay every year.

Category: Salt Levels in your Horse’s Ration
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When we think of salt for horses, we are talking about sodium chloride, which is the same as table salt. All horses need sodium chloride, and so there are amounts of these nutrients in most of the feeds your horse is getting already from pasture, hay, grain and supplements. However, the question is how much salt should your horse be getting each day and do you need to supplement? The answer is your horses probably need to be on a salt supplement and may need a large amount if sweating excessively. Equine sweat contains a lot of sodium and chloride so the more your horse sweats, the more sodium the horse needs in the ration. Sodium is also the electrolyte that stimulates thirst so if your horse is low in sodium, water consumption may decrease and then lots of problems can occur, including colic. It is believed most average size adult horses need about 50 grams of salt per day. But as I mentioned earlier, it is hard to put an actual number on it when you consider a sweating horse needs more. Regardless, a study was performed on moderately exercised warmbloods on a low forage diet that had 100 grams salt added to their diets daily, which caused acidification of the blood and increased sodium chloride in the urine. Adding 50 grams salt per day did not have any of these side effects so the authors felt adding 50 grams salt per day to a normal horse’s ration was a reasonable amount: it’s about 3 ounces of table salt per day. You can use an electrolyte supplement instead but sometimes it is difficult to determine the amount of salt in the product so you should be safe adding 3 ounces of table salt to your horse’s ration daily year round.

Category: Sand Elimination from the Horse's Gastrointestinal Tract
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are many causes of colic in horses, and sand colic is just one of them. Sand colic is one of the most common causes of horses who have recurrent colic, and it's common in many areas in which horses are kept on sandy soil. Many horses that are fed on the ground and are boarded on sandy soil or that graze on short grass on sandy pastures pick up small amounts of sand as they eat. Over time, this sand accumulates in the colon and causes inflammation, decreased function, and impaction. Several recommended products to remove the sand include psyllium and magnesium sulfate. Psyllium is the ingredient in the human product Metamucil, and magnesium sulfate is commonly known as Epsom salts; both of these products used to remove sand from horse's colon are commonly available over the counter. Of course, the dosage for a horse is much larger in than humans, as routinely a pound of each drug is administered to a horse by a nasogastric tube placed in the horse's stomach. There is some question as to which of these medications is most effective at removing sand and a study was performed in Helsinki, Finland, to determine the answer. A group of horses diagnosed with sand accumulation were divided into groups and one group was given psyllium, one group was given Epsom salts, and another group was given both. The group that received both psyllium and Epsom salts had the largest decrease in sand in the colon as found on x-rays. So it seems the use of psyllium and Epsom salts together is the most effective treatment for removing sand. However, the large amount of magnesium could cause a problem in horses who have renal disease.

Category: Severe Dehydration and the Exhausted Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses can become dehydrated easily, and after prolonged periods of exercise can develop what is called the exhausted horse syndrome. Clinical signs of the exhausted horse include depression and disinterest in their surroundings and in eating and drinking. Dr. Emma Adam indicates in the AAEP proceedings that some of these horses will stop sweating, and this causes other problems as they are unable to cool themselves. They typically have elevated heart rates and elevated respiratory rates even after exercise has stopped. Usually their rectal temperature is increased as they cannot cool down, but with severe disease the temperature can actually be below normal. The pulse may be weak when palpated and may be difficult to feel. The mucous membranes of the mouth may be tacky and dry with a prolonged capillary refill time. Place your finger on the horse's gums and pull it away; if your finger temporarily sticks to the gum, this is the tacky feel. Also, placing your finger with pressure over the gum and then removing it will cause the tissue to turn white temporarily and then the pink color will return. The capillary refill time is the time in seconds it takes for the pink color to return and anything over 2.5 seconds is abnormal and indicates poor circulation. However, if the membranes are brick red and capillary refill is less than 1 second - which is very fast - this may indicate endotoxemia in which toxins are produced and have been absorbed into the blood stream. If your horse develops any of these symptoms, stop all exercise and have your vet examine your horse immediately as this is a serious condition. Intravenous fluid therapy and other treatment may be necessary.

Category: Soaking Hay to Remove Sugar for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hay high in carbohydrates should not be fed to horses with insulin resistance unless the hay is soaked in water.  Soaking hay to remove sugar has become commonplace in these cases, but how much sugar is actually removed? Soaking it reduces the water-soluble carbohydrates, and the amount reduced depends on how long it has been soaked.  High levels of carbohydrates cause an increase in blood insulin levels, which is detrimental to horses with laminitis and founder or can cause laminitis to develop.  Dr. Annette Longland from Wales tested nine different hays to determine the amount of carbohydrates and protein decreased by soaking.  The study involved soaking 4 pounds of hay in 6 gallons of tap water that was at a temperature of 46°F  (7.7°C). Different batches were soaked for 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 3 hours, and 16 hours.  Results indicated soaking did decrease carbohydrates but the amount depended on the length of time the hay was soaked.  Soaking hay for 20 minutes resulted in the lowest decrease in carbohydrates of only 5%, while soaking hay for up to 16 hours showed the greatest reduction at 27%. The differences in soaking times did not significantly affect the loss of protein.  So, although soaking 16 hours was effective, the decrease in carbohydrates even after soaking may not be enough to be safe for some horses.  A lot depends on the level of carbohydrates in the hay to start with as the lower level of carbs the hay contains, the less you have to soak out.  Lots of folks soak hay for 30-60 minutes and that is likely not enough time, depending on the hay.  Ideally, you would find hay that has less than 10% non-structural carbohydrate content so that soaking would not be required.  Talk to your equine veterinarian.

Category: Supplement Effectiveness on Equine Stomach Ulcers
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Stomach ulcers are common in performance horses; 90 percent of race horses and a large percentage of other performance horses have been shown to have ulcers. There are two types of stomach ulcers in horses because there are two distinct areas of the horse’s stomach. One area is the glandular stomach, which is protected by mucous and other barriers. The most likely cause of ulcers in this area is stress or medications like butazolidine for pain and these ulcers are rare. The most common type of ulcer is in the nonglandular part of the stomach and is generally not related to being given butazolidin but it is related to exercise, diet, and the stress of being kept in a stall and not being allowed to graze. This area of the stomach is not protected and since the horse’s stomach secretes acid continually, horses fed just twice a day in a stall have no protection so ulcers develop, especially when the horses are exercised. The only approved treatment of stomach ulcers is a drug called GastroGard that increases the pH of the stomach by decreasing gastric acid, and it is effective. However, it is expensive especially with long-term treatment and as soon as the drug is stopped, ulcers will recur. There are multiple products on the market that claim to decrease ulcers but there is no evidence to support their use in most cases. However, the vets at LSU performed a study using a commercially available supplement called Smart Gut Ultra Pellets and found that after stopping GastroGard, the Smart Gut product decreased ulcer formation compared to untreated horses.

Category: Supplements for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When you walk into the feed store or open a horse magazine, you are probably overwhelmed with the number of supplements available and some of the questionable claims made by their manufacturers.  You can find supplements that claim to make every organ in your horse’s body better and help increase speed while curing any problem of the joints, hooves, immune system, or skin.  So how do you tell which of these supplements your horse really needs and which ones are not needed? First of all, ask the manufacturer for scientific information that their product performs as they claim.  Unfortunately, most don’t have any scientific information, and their claims are made on theories and not fact.  And because these products are all called nutraceuticals, not drugs, and as such are not regulated by the FDA, proof of efficacy is not required.  All the manufacturers have testimonials about their products, but testimonials are the lowest form of proof because they are not scientific. Asking your veterinarian is probably the best method to determine if your horse really needs a supplement.  As a general rule, I believe at least 75% of the supplements used on today’s horses are not needed and yet many people spend hundreds of dollars a month on products that have not been shown to be effective or even absorbed in horses.  So even though some equine supplements may be helpful, many are not needed so carefully examine the supplements you are feeding. You may find you are giving some supplements your horse does not need and you may save some money in the process.

Category: Techniques for Feeding Hay to Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The price of hay in the United States has increased dramatically during the last several years due to increasing fuel costs and lack of supply.  Consequently, this increases the overall costs of keeping your horse and if there is anything that can be done management wise to save money, it would be worthwhile.  Some producers prefer to feed hay to horses on the ground and others prefer to feed in feeders.  To study different methods of feeding hay, a study was performed at Sam Houston State in Huntsville to determine the least wasteful method of feeding hay to stalled horses.  In this study, twelve 2-year-old quarter horses were fed coastal Bermuda hay for 2 weeks both in feeders and then on the ground.  The study determined that horses fed hay on the ground wasted over 7% of the hay while horses who ate from the feeders wasted only a little over 1% of the hay.  Using feeders also helped to reduce fecal and urine contamination and trampling. Although there were no nutritional deficiencies noted as horses gained the same amount of weight regardless of feeding method, the difference in wasted hay was certainly significant.  No signs of colic were observed feeding in stalls or on the ground.  So it seems that feeding hay in feeders is the best method to prevent waste.  I am assuming from reading this study that the stalls were concrete with mats although this was not mentioned.  Consequently, if horses were fed on the ground in stalls with sand or dirt, it is likely they would lose even more hay.  Regardless, if you feed your horses hay, using feeders will save hay and money in the long run.

Category: Tifton 85 Grass versus Coastal Bermuda for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Coastal Bermuda is the most common hay fed to horses in Texas.  The University of Florida extension service indicates that coastal Bermuda grass is actually a cross or hybrid between two Bermuda grasses that was developed in Georgia in 1943.  Coastal Bermuda has sterile flowers as there is no seed production and the plant reproduces vegetatively through pieces of stems or runners.  A similar grass is Tifton 85, and lots of folks call it Bermuda grass but it is different as Tifton 85 is a cross between a Bermuda grass and a close tropical relative called stargrass that was used in the cross to increase digestibility.  Tifton 85 is taller with larger stems and darker colored broader leaves, while the rhizomes or underground stems are fewer in number but larger to increase drought tolerance.  But although Tifton 85 is more drought tolerant than coastal Bermuda, it is less winter hardy so there are some areas in which Tifton 85 may not do as well. As far as production, testing in Florida indicates that in general Tifton 85 yields more forage compared to coastal, is more digestible, has a lower sugar content, and is slightly higher in crude protein.  Although it has thicker stems, the stems have higher fiber content that is more digestible.  The University of Florida indicates that in their studies, it’s not true that Tifton 85 has larger stems and is not palatable for horses.  And the fact that Tifton 85 is lower in sugar content is important because we have so many horses that are insulin resistant and have developed laminitis and foundered.  So if you have a horse that is insulin resistant and has foundered, consider testing Tifton 85 for its sugar content as it may be a better option  for you than coastal Bermuda.

Category: Vitamin E May Be Helpful in Stressed Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses can develop oxidative stress that can lead to tissue damage and illness due to reduced immune function.  Dr. Carrie Finno from the University California at Davis says that oxidative stress occurs when free radical production exceeds the animal’s ability to detoxify these highly reactive, unstable molecules.  Fortunately, the body has several naturally occurring antioxidants in place to squelch the damaging molecules and stop the chain reaction of destruction they cause. Dr. Stacey Oke indicates in the Horse publication that vitamin E is one of the most potent antioxidants protecting various cells from harmful effects of free radicals.  As long as there is sufficient vitamin E in the diet, it can stop the oxidation from occurring. One of the most common areas in which damage occurs is in cells involving the immune system.  There is evidence in many domestic animals that vitamin E supplementation can improve immune function, but few studies have been performed in horses.  Research shows that horses that were initially fed diets low in vitamin E and selenium had increased immune responses after vaccination when vitamin Ewas supplemented.  Vitamin E supplementation has also been shown to increase the bacterial-killing capacity of the infection-fighting white blood cells.  However, you can’t just supplement every horse with vitamin E because over-supplementation can lead to bleeding problems and inappropriate metabolism of other vitamins.  To determine if your horse even needs vitamin E supplementation, your vet can check the vitamin E level in your horse’s blood.  Also, there are a lot of differences in the type of vitamin E in supplements so always ask your equine vet about the best type of vitamin E supplement for your horse.

Category: Water, Horses Drinking Too Much?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The first thing to know when wondering if your horse is drinking too much water is how much your horse actually drinks on average per day. If you don’t know your horse’s normal water consumption, it is difficult to know abnormal. Normal water consumption in a 1000-lb horse is about 5-10 gallons per day depending on the weather, although some horses on pasture may normally only drink 3-4 gallons and some horses in hot environments or mares nursing foals may drink 15 gallons per day. So it is important to know how much your horse drinks per day so you can know if that amount changes. Polydipsia is the term for increased water consumption, which in horses is defined as consuming more than 50 milliliters per pound of horse. For a 1000-pound horse, this is about 13 gallons per day, so you see there is some overlap. However, this average number of 13 gallons is for a normal nonpregnant and non-exercising horse with a normal outside temperature. Another thing you may notice if your stalled horse is drinking too much water is an excessive amount of urine in the stall; if you see this, it is important to consult your vet. The two most common diseases in horses that cause increased water consumption are chronic kidney failure and Cushing’s disease. There are many other potential causes but if your horse is drinking excessive water, it is a good idea to have your vet perform an exam and check some blood work. If kidney disease is involved, a change in diet may be helpful and if Cushing’s disease is diagnosed, a medication can help prevent some of the conditions caused by the disease, such as laminitis and founder.

Category: Weight Loss in Foals
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many foals are born healthy and are growing well until about three months of age and then growth seems to slow, according to Dr. Kathleen Crandall, a nutritionist with Kentucky Equine Research. Certainly, heavy burdens of roundworms can cause weight loss and all foals should be dewormed every month for three months starting at two months of age to control roundworms. Many cases of roundworms occur because ivermectin is used as a dewormer and ivermectin is not very effective against roundworms, regardless of the label claim. The other causes of weight loss include respiratory and digestive infections. Intestinal disease is usually caused by E. coli, Salmonella, Clostridium and Lawsonia; Lawsonia is really an interesting bacteria in that many of the horses do not have diarrhea but still lose weight. Many of them will have intermittent colic and may be lethargic as well as accumulating fluid in the lower legs due to intestinal protein loss. As far as respiratory causes of weight loss, Rhodococcus is a bacterium that causes pneumonia and abscesses to develop in the foal’s lungs. These foals lose weight and have a fever, loss of appetite, are lethargic. Dr. Crandall indicates that it is important to determine the body condition score of foals differently than adult horses. Foals generally add fat along the withers and behind the elbows and only then does fat accumulate along the back and ribcage. Because of this, foals that have their ribs showing may be normal weight while adult horses appearing in this manner are too thin.

Category: Weight Loss in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the major health problems in humans as well as many domestic animals is obesity, and horses are no exception. Horses that are overweight have more problems with arthritis as they get older and also have poorer performance than horses at a normal weight. Also, horses that are overweight are more likely to develop laminitis and founder, which is a major and potentially deadly problem. Some horses are overweight because they are simply fed too much or have access to large amounts of lush pasture while some are more susceptible to gaining weight because they are insulin resistant. Regardless, getting them to lose weight is critical and is not easy to accomplish and today I am going to talk about methods to help your horse lose weight. Horses evolved eating very small meals by grazing about 16 hours of a 24-hour day and in most cases, horses are not fed in that manner today. Many horses are kept in stalls and are fed two meals a day, which is not the best method of feeding horses. Certainly a restricted diet is necessary but for a horse to lose weight, they must be fed about 60 percent of their maintenance requirements. You may be surprised by this but just decreasing calories by a small amount may prevent weight gain but will not cause weight loss to occur. So again, you would want to feed about 60 percent of the amount a horse of healthy weight would eat at an ideal weight. When feeding smaller amounts, one thing that will help is to feed in a hay net with small openings. Researchers at the University of Minnesota conducted a study that revealed horses fed on the ground ate twice as fast as those eating out of hay nets with small openings, and the longer it takes the horse to eat, the more natural it is for them. They eat less and also have a decreased chance of developing stomach ulcers. Lush pastures can be a problem for horses as the pastures are high in carbohydrates and can cause horses to gain weight quickly.  A recent study out of England indicated that horses and ponies that gain weight are more than twice as likely to develop laminitis than if they lose or even just maintain their weight.  Laminitis is a painful and potentially deadly foot condition that develops in horses and can lead to founder.  The study revealed that British native pony breeds and horses and ponies with a history of laminitis as well as those with foot lameness or soreness after trimming were more susceptible to laminitis with weight gain.   The study included over 1,000 horses over a 2.5 year period. Horse owners weighed their horses routinely with a special weight tool and estimated a body condition score. They also found that horses were at a greater risk of laminitis when shod or trimmed at intervals longer than 8 weeks and those horses required a longer time to respond to treatment.  Make sure your horse’s feet are trimmed at least every 8 weeks, in most cases.  Future investigations need to be started concerning the use and effect of grazing muzzles and the length of time a susceptible horse can safely graze and not develop laminitis.  It was also found that some horses gained weight even when the owners were trying to get them to lose weight so it is important for horses owners to use a method to weight their horses and not just try and determine weight from observation.

Category: Weight Loss in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although most horses these days seem to be overweight, it is not uncommon for veterinarians to see horses for lack of weight gain. Many times a horse is examined and seems to be fairly normal. Certainly a complete nutritional history is important and often a problem with the diet causes the problem. I assign a body condition score to each horse and this score is a number ranging from 1 to 9, with 1/9 being extremely thin to 9/9 being extremely obese. Normal horses are a 5-6/9. If the physical exam is normal, Dr. Harold Schott indicates in DVM 360 that a rectal exam by your vet is important to check for internal abscesses and cancer. Certainly, a good oral exam under sedation with a full mouth speculum is required to make sure there are no diseased teeth or foreign bodies in the mouth that could affect eating. And this may seem simple but you need to monitor how much the horse is eating and make sure the horse is actually eating adequate amounts of feed. Many times this requires separating the horse from others to measure food intake. Also, look at the entire herd because if all the horses are thin, it is likely a nutritional problem but if all others are fat and only one loses weight, then quality of feed is not likely involved. Blood work consisting of a complete blood count and blood chemistry are important to check for internal abnormalities. The blood count checks for low red blood cell count, or anemia, and the white blood cell count can indicate infection. The chemistry profile can determine health of the liver, kidney, and protein levels and these values can give the vet an idea of the location of the horse's problem.

Category: What is Grass Hay for Horses?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Grass hay may seem simple, but it’s not necessarily simple. Equi-Analytical Lab sent out a survey to their clients and 90% of the respondents indicated they feed their horses grass hay. However, there are lots of different plants that can make up grass hay. Grasses commonly used for equine forage production are orchard grass, timothy, smooth brome grass, tall fescue, meadow fescue, Kentucky blue grass, perennial and Italian rye, Bermuda grass and even wheat. With all these possible grasses involved, the nutrient value will differ depending on the concentration of grasses involved and their rate of maturity when bailed. Because of this, it is important to identify the grasses in the grass hay you are purchasing so you can compare it to average values that a good quality grass hay should contain. Also, it is critical to have multiple samples of the hay analyzed to determine the analysis since many hays contain a large range of different grasses. For example, general grass hay and Bermuda grass hay are fairly similar but Bermuda grass is lower in water soluble carbohydrates. If wheat is in the grass hay, the carbohydrate level will be higher; this is important if you have a horse with equine metabolic syndrome because increased carbohydrates can lead to founder in these horses. So the important point is that all grass hay is not equal and before buying it and feeding it to your horses, it is worth the money to have it tested so your can be confident you are feeding the correct hay.

Category: When Is Feed Too Old for Horses?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Kentucky Equine Research indicates that reputable feed manufacturers blend fresh ingredients to create palatable concentrates for horses and then provide valuable nutritional information about the products on bags and tags.  Aside from the nutritional guarantees and ingredients, some manufacturers will stamp their products with useful information pertaining to manufacture date and best use practices.  Unlike many products for human consumption, bags of horse feed are not required to have manufacture or best by dates, although many feed mills do list this information.  Although the manufacture date is important, the best by date is pretty vague because the manufacturer doesn’t really know the best by date. The date has to do with the conditions in which the feed is stored after purchase.  If products are stored in a cool, low-humidity pest-free atmosphere they might be good to feed beyond the best by date. However, those conditions are rare in climates where it is hot and humid with lots of insects, so the feed might not even be good until the suggested best by date.  Feed stored in hot trailers with exposure to external moisture and left open for insects is certainly going to decrease the time you can use that feed.  There are differences in the various kinds of feeds as straight grains have the longest shelf life, followed by extruded feeds that are subject to heat processing during manufacture. Both contain little moisture.  Pelleted feeds undergo some exposure to heat and low moisture during processing so shelf life is moderate. The feeds with the shortest shelf life are those textured feeds containing molasses as they are prone to mold and spoilage.

Category: Winter Hay and Pasture Testing for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In fall and winter, the pasture grass declines in quality and we need to begin feeding hay to our horses.  In the past, you just called the feed store or hay supplier and told them you needed hay, but now we know that all hays are not the same.  With the discovery of Cushing’s disease or PPID and equine metabolic syndrome, we now know that many of these horses need a low carbohydrate ration, and it has been shown that grass hay can have anywhere from 5-35 percent carbohydrates as reported by Equianalytical Lab.  If you have a horse with insulin resistance, who need to be eating hay that is less than 10 percent nonstructural carbohydrates, it is important to know the carbohydrate values of the hay before you buy it.  Hopefully, your hay dealer tests their hay but if they do not, ask them to do so. If you test the hay yourself, you will need a hay probe, an electric drill and a one-quart plastic bag to contain the sample.  You would want to sample at least 10 bales and should send at least a pound of hay to the lab.  If you want to sample the pasture also, take about 20 samples at different areas by using scissors to cut off the portion of the plant the horse is eating.  If the horse is not having to eat close to the ground, you don’t need to sample that portion.  Cut up the grass in 2-inch segments and mix it thoroughly.  Testing is available for all parameters in hay and pasture if you want to do so; if you are a hay producer, this would be a good idea.  However, if you have horses that are resistant to insulin, you can just ask for a starch panel and these tests are fairly inexpensive and certainly worth the money.

Category: Barn Construction for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Are you building a horse barn or adding onto yours? The flooring of your barn is a main consideration; choose materials that would keep the floor dry but will still be durable. Also, it needs to provide good traction yet be easy to clean. Although more expensive than other materials, roughened concrete fits these criteria better than most other materials. It is important to have drains on the sides of the aisles to make cleaning easier. It is really important to have a concrete floor in the feed room and make it possible for that room to be completely sealed in order to keep rodents and other varmints out of the feed. A wash area is important and the flooring there should also be concrete. However, the one thing many barns do not have that could be added easily in the wash area is a horse stock. Stocks are inexpensive to build, can be placed in the concrete, and can prevent the horse from moving when being examined. From a veterinarian’s point of view, this makes doing many procedures on horses much easier and will also make follow up care easier and safer for you and your horse. Also, it is really important to put a solid rubber mat under the stock. This allows better footing and is more comfortable for the horse while in the stock. Be sure and place electrical outlets in the wash area as well as plenty of water faucets. All of these items are much easier and less expensive installed initially rather than added later. A stock with water and electricity will allow your veterinarian to perform some procedures at your farm that otherwise might not be possible.

Category: Blanketing a Horse when Temperatures Increase May Cause Heat Stress
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In cooler weather, many of you with horses will be thinking about blanketing your horse. A study out of Sweden and Norway indicated that most horse owners lacked scientific knowledge about blanketing their horses as about one half of the respondents of the survey revealed horse owners did not understand the way the horse’s natural temperature regulation system works. Dr. Cecilie Mejdell from Norway reports at the horse.com that a blanket will obviously protect the horse from feeling cold due to adverse weather such as rain, wind and low temperatures. The problem is the horse’s own ability to regulate temperatures is hampered by the blanket. The chilling effect from sweating and increased blood flow in the skin is reduced so the horse may suffer from heat stress when the weather is changing and there is sun radiation and high outside temperatures. So if the weather gets warm and there is no one around to remove the blanket, this can be a problem. This is typical in Texas: when it is 40⁰F in the morning, people blanket their horses and go to work, and the afternoon temperature becomes 60⁰F and the horse is still blanketed. In the study, many horse owners blanketed their horses as soon as temperatures decreased below 50⁰F. This does not mean blankets should not be used. However, they are used far too often, especially in climates like that of Texas, and should not be blanketed until the temperature is at least less than 40⁰F and as soon as the temperature rises during the day above 40⁰F, the blanket should be removed. This gives the horse the opportunity to self-regulate the temperature; we really do not want to disturb this ability when using a blanket that is not needed.

Category: Blanketing your Horse in Winter
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In winter, many people blanket their horses, but blanketing can affect the amount of hay the horse consumes. Blanketing is controversial, especially in Texas as in most of Texas our winters are not really that cold, and blanketing can also have some unwanted side effects such as skin disease or overheating in some horses. A recent study performed in Wisconsin by Dr. Michelle Deboer found that blanketed horses ate 8% less free choice hay than unblanketed horses and yet maintained normal body condition.  The Horse publication reported that the researchers blanketed eight adult horses in a dry outdoor paddock in Wisconsin from December to January during which they did not blanket eight other horses in an adjacent paddock.  Each group of horses had identical free choice hay. The researchers found that the blanketed horses’ weight and body condition remained the same but the horses with blankets ate less than horses without blankets and the difference was about 2 pounds of hay per day. So, horses voluntarily reduce hay intake when blanketed but this does not cause weight loss as the horses use less energy to keep warm and could even gain weight. Blankets can hide an individual’s body condition so you want to make sure the horse is not gaining or losing weight under the blanket.  This study shows you could save a little money on hay but that would likely be offset by buying and maintaining a blanket. I believe a blanket is not needed unless the temperature is freezing or lower or there is freezing rain. Then when the weather warms up, get the blanket off and allow the horses to get acclimated to the outside temperature. Realize this study was performed in Wisconsin and eight of these horses lived all winter without blankets with no health issues.

Category: Cleaning and Disinfecting Horse Stalls and Trailers
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Disinfecting horse stalls and other areas horses use, such as trailers, is important for their health. The need is not only true for stalls and trailers and, in fact, is necessary in other animal areas including dogs, cats and other livestock areas as well. Disinfecting also helps prevent human transmission of disease to horses. The most important factor in disinfecting in all situations is cleaning the area prior to disinfecting. It has been shown that cleaning removes up to 90% of the infectious organisms. Regardless of the claims the manufacturer makes on the bottle of disinfectant, none of them are effective over organic matter and adult horses produce about 50 pounds of organic matter per day including urine and feces. Also included in organic matter is nasal discharges, material from draining abscesses, blood, and any other type of body fluids and excretions. So until this organic matter is removed by thorough cleaning, disinfectants will not be effective. Thorough cleaning requires a detergent and some manual labor to completely remove organic matter and this requires scrubbing the area to be cleaned. High pressure water sprays are not recommended for cleaning infectious areas because the high pressure can aerosolize infectious organisms and spread them to other areas. In disinfectants, there is no one-step product that is going to be effective regardless of the advertising claims on these products. Products that claim to clean and disinfect at the same time are not going to be effective. As far as a disinfectant, bleach diluted in water is very effective and inexpensive. Regardless of the disinfectant you choose, follow the label on the bottle as more is not always better.

Category: Decreasing Horse Colic in Winter
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When cold weather arrives, one horse problem we are more concerned about than normal is colic. And although the weather here in Texas does not get as cold as it does up north, it is still cold enough to have an effect on the horses, and in fact, i think the effect in Texas may be greater than up north because our weather changes so much. We have days that are 70 degrees and the next day may be 30 degrees, and I believe this affects animals more than just constant cold. The main reason colic increases in cold weather is that horses do not drink enough water and I think these horses just aren't thirsty in cold weather. Also, hay has less water in it than green grass in the pasture, so that is another area of decreased moisture. With dry areas in the intestine, feed dries out and an impaction develops, thereby causing colic pain. Poor quality hay is less digestible, which increases the chance of colic. Many times during the winter, horse owners increase the volume of the horse's feed to meet the energy demands, but this can upset their digestive tract and cause a decrease in function. Another concern is that many horses are kept in stalls in the winter due to the cold temperature. Standing in a stall may slow movement of the digestive tract, which also leads to an impaction. Some options to increase water consumption are bringing warm water out to your horse or having heated water troughs or water bucket heaters. Soaking the hay in water may be helpful to increase your horse's water intake, and adding water to the feed will sometimes be effective if the horse will eat it. If you are going to increase feed, then increase the hay and not the concentrate. Finally, keep the horses out in the pasture as much as possible rather than in a stall.

Category: Disaster Preparedness for Livestock
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If a natural disaster affects your home, it is terrible and can be much more difficult if you have livestock. Livestock can be even more difficult to handle during a disaster due to their size. Most livestock, except horses, are not well trained. According to Dr. Erin Gatz, DVM, from Texas Veterinary Medical Association, in the online publicationTexVetPets,it is important to have current medical records of vaccination and disease testing, such as Coggins test reports, for your horses. Have pictures of your horses and, ideally, have your horses microchipped. Keep ear tags on small ruminants and tags or brands on cattle for identification during an emergency or disaster. A non-toxic paint can be used on cows for short-term identification. Have a set evacuation route as part of a written evacuation plan. Generally, the local police department will decide the best routes. Determine the best area with the highest ground nearby, and, if possible, a shelter to pasture livestock in case of a flood. You may be able to evacuate some of your livestock depending on the amount of time you have, and the number of livestock involved. Check to make sure your trailer and trucks used to haul livestock are in good shape. This includes having good tires on the vehicles. If you are using your trailer as a storage area, clean it out if possible, so it is ready when you receive notice of a potentially threatening event. Have at least 3 days of feed and water available, and plan ahead by knowing where you can take your horses and other livestock in a disaster.

Category: Disease Protection at Horse Shows
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In the summer, it seems like everyone goes to horse shows. One concern about horse shows is exposing your horse to the diseases of other horses. This problem became big news in early 2012 when an outbreak of neurologic equine herpes virus developed at a national cutting horse show in Utah. Many horses were exposed, several were infected, and a few died or were euthanized. Anytime you go to a horse show, you risk your horse’s health but there are some things you can do to prevent disease transmission. First of all, make sure your horse is vaccinated by your veterinarian because your vet knows which brands of vaccine are the most effective for the diseases in your area. Vaccination would not have helped in the herpes outbreak because there is no vaccine approved to protect against the neurological strain of herpes. However, there are other vaccines that will prevent contagious diseases so vaccination is important. Always bring your own feed and water buckets and never share with other horses without disinfecting. Try to avoid nose to nose contact with other horses as much as possible as most of the contagious diseases are transmitted through respiratory secretions. Anytime you are involved with other people's horses, wash your hands or disinfect with a 62% alcohol gel product. Since early detection of infection is important, Dr. Roberta Dwyer from the University of Kentucky indicates in Equine Disease Quarterly to take all your horse’s temperatures twice a day. After returning home from a show, continuing to take your horse’s temperature for two weeks after returning, and if you have other horses, quarantine the show horses from the rest of your herd for two weeks.

Category: Dust Management in your Riding Arena
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the major problems when riding your horse in an arena is the dust, especially in indoor arenas. Dust can cause lot of problems for the rider and the horse, including increasing allergies and causing inflammation in the eyes and respiratory tract. An idle horse inhales about 16 gallons of air per minute and a horse in strenuous exercise inhales about 600 gallons of air per minute, so any dust in the air can cause a serious problem in the exercising horse's lungs. The Penn State College of Agriculture indicates that it is important to eliminate fine particles such as silt, clay or fine sand in the top footing mixture. Even course materials such as sand and wood products can break down and become dusty over time, especially if manure is not removed frequently as it breaks down and contributes to dust. The next step to decrease dust is to add water. Deep watering is important to not only decrease dust but to also add stability for riding. The top three inches of the soil should be evenly moist and a soil moisture meter can be used to determine when further watering is needed. You can also decrease dust by using an additive to bind particles together; many of these additives available. Wood chips and other organic materials retain moisture well and may be a good first option. Synthetic or natural fibers can be used to bind materials together, and crystals and gels that resemble cat litter can absorb a large amount of water and release it as needed. Oil-based products like coconut or soybean oil can weigh down or glue together fine particles. Salt has commonly been used to suppress dust in arenas as it holds moisture and also draws moisture out of the air although salt application must be repeated usually every 6 months.

Category: Extreme Heat Care for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The hottest part of the summer certainly affects our animals, and this includes horses. The most important thing for horses during extreme heat is fresh, clean water. An average adult horse needs five to seven gallons per day in cool weather, but in hot weather, depending on activity, may need 20 gallons. With multiple horses, you need several water tanks spaced apart so one dominant horse can not keep timid horses from drinking. Adding electrolytes to the feed is a really good idea all year round, but especially important at this time to keep them drinking and to replace electrolytes lost in sweat. A salt block is okay, but horses need extra electrolytes also. For horses that do not drink well, Dr. Nancy Loving indicates in the Horse magazine that adding water to the feed will help increase intake, especially if you are traveling and the water tastes differently. Hot weather also brings flies, so don’t forget fly sheets, insect repellant, and fans to keep the insects off at certain times of the day. Lots of horses are allergic to flying insect bites, so bringing them in at dusk and dawn under fans may help decrease the problem. Hopefully, you have some shade trees or a loafing shed in the pasture with good ventilation. Although concerning, this is really not a problem with horses that are not being worked and are just resting in the pasture. Heat stress is a concern for horses working hard in this hot and humid weather, especially if you have a horse that is not sweating (called anhidrosis). If you think your horse is developing heat stress with an increased respiratory rate even at rest, check the temperature, and if it is over 103.5°F, remove the tack, spray the horse with cool water, and then scrape it off until the temperature is less than 102°F and breathing is regular.

Category: Feeding Horses with Pasture-Associated Laminitis
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Laminitis is a painful and serious condition of horse's feet and it can lead to founder. Although most folks think of founder developing in horses who are eating large quantities of grain, more horses develop laminitis and founder on pasture grass due to the high concentration of carbohydrates in the grass than those eating grain. Pasture-associated laminitis usually occurs in horses that are susceptible to laminitis and those are horses that are usually overweight, are easy keepers, and have equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing's disease. In these susceptible horses, it has been recommended to decrease the amount of pasture and so lots of folks try to decrease the amount of time horses are grazing. However, a study has shown that when horses are restricted from pasture for a part of the day, they increase the amount of grass they eat when they are on pasture and so restricting the time on pasture is not effective unless it is severely restricted to just a few minutes a day. Also, there are differences in carbohydrate concentration in the grass depending on the time of day. Because of photosynthesis that occurs with sunlight during the day, grass in the early morning has less carbohydrate than grass in the afternoon. So if you are going to allow a horse to graze for a few minutes per day, it would be safer to allow this grazing in the early morning versus the late afternoon. Another management practice that should be considered in these susceptible horses is the amount of food the horse receives at a meal. A study out of Ohio State has shown that horses that are fed smaller meals more frequently have lower insulin levels and lower insulin decreases the chance of laminitis developing.

Category: Free Fecal Water Syndrome Isn't Diarrhea in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Free fecal water syndrome is not the same as diarrhea. With diarrhea, the entire stool is loose or even watery. With free fecal water syndrome, the stool is normal but small amounts of very thin water with a small amount of feces are passed before, after or during defecation. And although this does not seem like a major problem, some horses have enough of this free fecal water to pollute the tail and legs, and it can be severe enough to cause skin lesions. This material on the legs and tail also attracts flies and makes it very difficult to keep these horses clean. Although not a common problem, the condition occurs enough that it has been blamed on many different factors with no proof of any actual cause. Some possibilities for the problem include feeding alfalfa hay, feeding haylage or silage, drinking very cold water, poor dental care, and parasites. Also, various nutritional supplements are marketed to prevent this problem because it seems there is a nutritional supplement marketed to cure every horse problem whether there is any proof the supplement is effective or not. To try and learn more about the condition, a study was performed in Germany and it found that the condition more likely occurred in horses that had a low rank in a group of horses. Also, the condition was more common in horses in the winter as it was believed the subordinate horses were confined in a smaller space, which leads to more anxiety. Dental disease, parasites and cold water intake was shown to not be related to the condition. Geldings are more commonly affected than mares as mares are usually more dominant than geldings.

Category: Herpes Virus Vaccination in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most serious infectious neurological diseases that affects horses is the neurological form of equine herpes virus. This virus caused all the problems at a big Quarter Horse event in Utah several years ago where several horses died. Equine herpes virus 1 causes this form of herpes, and there are vaccines available to protect against herpes virus. However, the vaccines are only labelled to protect horses against the respiratory form and the one that causes abortion; none are labelled for protection against the neurological form. In fact, the neurological form has occurred in horses that were well vaccinated. Some people that believe vaccination may actually increase the chance of horses developing the neurological form. So the ability of vaccines to protect against the neurological form is unknown. Because of this lack of understanding, a study was performed at Oklahoma State to attempt to determine the ability of vaccine to be protective. Six aged mares were vaccinated three times with Pneumabort-K, which is a high antigen vaccine, and another six mares were used as controls and not vaccinated. There are several different vaccines available for herpes virus and some have higher antigen loads than others. After three vaccinations at monthly intervals, all horses were exposed to a neurological strain of the virus. Results showed five of the six unvaccinated horses had more severe disease versus only one of the six vaccinated horses having severe disease. In this study, horses vaccinated with a high antigen vaccine had less severe clinical signs than unvaccinated horses. Ask your veterinarian about vaccination against equine herpes virus.

Category: Horse Hay and Pasture Testing for the Winter
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English As we enter the fall and winter, the pasture grass is declining in quality and we will be needing to feed hay to our horses.  In the past, you just called the feed store or hay supplier and told them you needed hay, but now we know that all hays are not the same.  With the discovery of Cushing’s disease or PPID and equine metabolic syndrome, we now know that many of these horses need a low-carbohydrate ration. Grass hay can have anywhere from 5 to 35 percent carbohydrates as reported by Equianalytical Lab.  Since horses with insulin resistance need to be eating hay that is less than 10 percent nonstructural carbohydrates, if you have insulin-resistant horses, it is important to know the carbohydrate values of the hay before you buy it.  Hopefully, your hay dealer tests their hay but if they do not, ask them to do so. If you test the hay yourself, you will need a hay probe, an electric drill, and a one-quart plastic bag to contain the sample.  You would want to sample at least 10 bales and should send at least a pound of hay to the lab.  If you also want to sample the pasture, take about 20 samples at different areas and with scissors, cut off the portion of the plant the horse is eating.  So, if the horse is not eating close to the ground, do not sample that portion.  Cut up the grass in two-inch segments and mix it thoroughly.  Testing is available for all parameters in hay and pasture if you want to do it. If you are a hay producer, this would be a good idea.  However, if you have horses that are resistant to insulin, you can just ask for a starch panel as these tests are fairly inexpensive and certainly worth the money.  Many labs can provide this information.

Category: Preventing Fire in your Horse Barn
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most devastating events that can occur is a barn fire that causes losses of livestock.  Mike Keenan, a consultant with an insurance company, indicates in National Hog Farmer that the first thing to do is isolate all animal housing areas in barn.  It is important to limit where combustible products and ignition sources are stored and keep those away from animal housing areas.  Equipment that increases risk of a barn fire are power washers, generators, and utility rooms.  Because of this risk, many producers are going to power washers and generators that are located outside of the barn so if a fire does start, the animals and barn itself would be spared.  Lots of hog barns, and horse barns at large ranches, have clothes dryers and it is critical to make sure the vents are cleaned regularly.  It is not a good idea to have employees place clothes in the drier the last thing and then leave for the day. Electrical panels are a common source of fires, especially when they are inside a livestock barn because gases from the barn can corrode the panels and start a fire.  Many insurance companies will check your barn with a thermal camera that can indicate hot areas in the wiring, so you can know you have an issue before an electrical problem develops.  Also, it is not a good idea to store tractors or lawn mowers in your livestock barn.  Recently in central Texas a farmer parked his lawn mower in his implement barn and a fire started soon after, destroying over $100,000 of equipment and the barn.  Luckily, this was not a livestock barn but you can see how quickly a fire can start. Separate barns or isolated storage areas are best.

Category: Slobbers in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A scary sight for a horse owner is to walk into the stall and see large amounts of saliva pouring from the horse’s mouth.  There are certainly several causes for this, such as choking or a blocked esophagus, exposure to certain insecticides, inability to swallow, or inflammation of the oral cavity. However, maybe the most common cause of excessive salivation is a condition appropriately called slobbers.  Slobbers occurs when a horse ingests pasture, hay, or silage that contains a fungus that is commonly found in soil and transmitted in seeds.  The fungus produces a mycotoxin called slaframine that produces the clinical signs of excessive salivation.  Other clinical signs include diarrhea, excessive tearing, frequent urination, stiffness, abortion, loss of appetite, bloating, and even death.  However, most cases simply have excessive salivary production that stops 24 hours after removing the infected hay. The fungus can be seen growing on the plants. Dr. R.H. Poppenga from U.C. Davis indicates the infection begins as a black to bronze patch on the leaves, usually on their underside.  The fungus will eventually spread and cover the entire plant, killing the plant.  Symptoms in animals eating the plants will depend on the concentration of the fungus.  The fungus is most commonly noted on red clover but can be found on many other plants including white clover, soybean, blue lupine, cow pea, alsike clover, and alfalfa.  If your horse is salivating excessively, it could just be due to fungus in the hay.  However, there also could be other problems such as botulism, so a vet exam is recommended.

Category: Water Quality Testing for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We all know that a source of good clean water is a requirement for animals, and that several different sources of water are common on horse farms and cattle ranches. Certainly some of these water sources are better than others when you consider farm ponds, streams, lakes, well water, and rural or city water systems. Dr. Steve Higgins indicates in Equine Disease Quarterly that it is difficult to find guidelines specific for equine drinking water because most of the guidelines are listed for all livestock. Water samples can be tested for physical properties, excessive nutrients, toxic compounds, and microbes. Water samples can also be tested for water hardness, salinity, and pH. Salinity is the presence of dissolved substances and hardness relates to the concentration of calcium and magnesium in the water. Excessive hardness can create mineral deposits on water pipes and affect the ability to disinfect these areas. Sulfates and nitrates can also be detected as well as arsenic, fluorine, lead, and mercury. Recently, a case of water sulfate toxicity was reported in Canada that resulted in the deaths of five horses and 13 horses with severe diarrhea out of a herd of 19. Fecal coliform analysis can help determine the presence of fecal matter and possible pathogens. Stagnant water during periods of a drought can cause excessive growth of blue green algae, and cattle have been reported to become sick or die from drinking water with high levels of blue green algae. Floods can also affect water sources as contamination with sewage and petrochemicals is common. If you are concerned about the water source for your livestock, contact the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Category: Altering a Horse's Tail and the Ethics behind It
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Those of you not familiar with different horse breeds may not know about the common practices of altering the tail in many breeds. Tails are altered for cosmetic reasons, for the show ring, or for competitive purposes, neither of which is done for the good of the horse and in fact, sometimes it is done to the horse’s detriment. Dr. Nat Messer is a professor of equine medicine at Missouri and he indicates in AAEP news that many of procedures to alter the tails, including blocking, cutting or docking, can have serious, life-threatening complications. Paralysis of the tail, severe clostridial infections at the base of the tail, and loss of the tail has been reported following these procedures. It is unethical for an AAEP member veterinarian to perform any of these procedures on a horse, and both the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and the American College of Veterinary Surgeons have come out against any procedures of docking or blocking tails. In some states, altering a horse’s tail is also illegal. There is no medical reason for any such procedure, and because it can be dangerous for the horse, trainers and owners should not request the procedure and veterinarians should not be willing to perform them. In some cases, because veterinarians are refusing to perform these illegal procedures, some trainers will perform the procedures themselves even though they do not have surgical training. Hopefully, tail alteration will become a technique of the past that will no longer be used.

Category: Ban on Soring Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Soring is a process used in Tennessee Walking Horses to increase their foot action and make their foot action faster and higher in an exaggerated gait for the show ring. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP)have recently called fora ban of soring. Although soring has been illegal for 40 years, horse trainers seem to find increasingly shrewd and more difficult to detect methods of soring and soring still plagues the walking horse industry. The AVMA and AAEP statement indicates they support a ban on the use of action devices and performance packages in the training and showing of Tennessee Walking Horses. Action devices used in training of these horses include chains, ankle rings, collars, rollers, and bracelets of wood and aluminum beads. When used in conjunction with chemicals that irritate the skin in the area of the pastern, the motion of the action devices creates a painful response that results in a more exaggerated gait. The U.S. Department of Agriculture indicates irritating foreign substances are detected at a very high rate on the pasterns of these horses at pre-show inspections. Also, performance packages that are also called stacks or pads are attached below the sole of the natural hoof and have a metal band that runs around the hoof wall to keep them in place. These performance packages can be made of plastic, wood, leather, rubber, or a combination. These packages add weight to the horse’s feet causing the feet to strike with more force and at an abnormal angle to the ground. These performance packages also conceal items causing pain on the sole of the horse’s feet that also increases the height of the horse’s gait.

Category: Barn Effect on Performance Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Melissa Mazan from the Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine in Massachusetts indicates 80% of stabled horses show evidence of inflammation in their airways. Also, a recent study at the school indicates that at least 25% of stabled horses show signs of inflammatory airway disease, such as coughing or exercise intolerance. Most of the time these symptoms are blamed on viral or bacterial diseases or allergies. However, even the cleanest of barns have large amounts of organic dust, including endotoxins and molds, that can lead to inflammatory airway disease and poor performance. People working in dusty areas like poultry barns have been shown to have a higher incidence of airway disease and asthma than people not exposed to this environment, even when there is only 0.3 mg dust per cubic meter. It has been shown that clean horse barns with good ventilation have three times that amount of organic dust in the air or about 1 mg dust per cubic meter. The reason these numbers are important is that when a horse is eating hay, the amount of dust can be as high as 12 mg per cubic meter, and some indoor riding arenas have levels as high as 60 mg dust per cubic meter. And we wonder why our horses cough all the time! All of these little particles cause significant inflammation in the lungs. So what can you do to control this dust? First of all, you can wet down the barn aisle before sweeping and water indoor arenas before riding. Also, keep horses out of the stalls for 2 hours after the stalls have been cleaned to let the dust settle. Always keep horses outside rather than in the barn as much as possible.

Category: Phenylbutazone and Fatal Injuries in Thoroughbred Racehorses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Phenylbutazone is commonly used for pain in some racehorses prior to a race, but this practice could increase the chance of fatal injuries.  A recent paper out of Argentina examined the use of phenylbutazone, commonly called bute, and the risk of musculoskeletal and fatal injuries in thoroughbred racehorses.  Phenylbutazone is an anti-inflammatory medication that reduces pain and inflammation in horses, and at this point it is not a prohibited substance in the horse’s blood while racing in the United States.  However, the last dose of bute can be given no less than 48 hours before the race and a maximum small amount of the drug is allowed in the horse’s system after a race. In a study recently published in the AVMA Journal out of Argentina on almost 300,000 race starts, horses that recently received bute were identified as being at a significantly increased risk of musculoskeletal injuries leading to fatalities.  The fatalities occurred not from the drug but from injuries received while racing that required euthanasia, and horses given bute before the race were twice as likely to have an injury that led to euthanasia.  The study’s authors believe that many horses given bute are older ones with chronic disease that may increase their chances of injury.  Also, the horses given bute are painful and lame to some degree as this is the reason they need bute to compete.  Bute decreases pain and allows the horses to potentially run faster and increases the chance they can hurt themselves by taking away the pain.

Category: Phenylbutazone is a Risk Factor for Breakdown Injuries in Racehorses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A recent study indicates that phenylbutazone, commonly called bute, is a risk factor for breakdown injuries in racehorses.  Breakdown injuries include are those that are catastrophic and non-fatal while racing. A grad student named Teresita Zambruno at the University of Glasgow published a paper that examined 500,000 horse racing starts in South America. She found multiple risk factors for breakdown injuries that had been found previously, but hers was the first study to find the association between phenylbutazone and breakdown injuries.  After looking at this study, the epidemiologist for the Jockey Club, Dr. Tim Parkin, indicated that he will call for policies that will allow zero phenylbutazone to be in the horse’s blood on race day.  This is a stricter recommendation than every state has at this time except California.  Dr. Parkin said that horses with phenylbutazone in their systems were 50% more likely to sustain a fatal or nonfatal musculoskeletal injury than those racing without a non-steroidal drug in their system. The author of the study believes the increased odds of fatality in the horses using phenylbutazone are because these horses need pain medication to race and bute may allow the horses to continue racing and training.  Various states have different legal limits for bute in the horse’s blood on race day and California adopted a new limit due to the increased number of breakdown injuries at the Santa Anita Race Track.  After California changed their regulations to not allow any bute in the horse’s blood before the race, breakdown injuries have decreased. However, California made several other changes as well so it is impossible to say all of the decreased numbers of breakdowns were due to changes in the bute regulations.

Category: Soring Horses is Illegal and Unethical
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about the practice of soring in horses.  Many of you may not be familiar with the term soring, but it involves the unethical and illegal act of deliberately inflicting pain to exaggerate the leg motion of horses.  This chest-high leg motion is rewarded in the show ring and usually is performed on Tennessee walking horses but has been used on other breeds.  The soring is performed by irritating or blistering the horse’s forelegs with chemical irritants or painful mechanical devises.  Some of the chemicals used are kerosene, diesel, Gojo hand cleaner and mustard oil.  These chemicals produce scars so after the soring, owners and trainers apply a stripping agent to burn off scar tissue to remove the soring scars, another painful practice.  A mechanical means of causing pain is excessively trimming the foot down to sensitive tissue or applying an object under the sole to cause hoof pain.  Some trainers apply metal bands above the hoof and over-tighten them as well as other methods to cause pain. In addition to being inhumane, soring is a violation of federal law as theHorse Protection Act of 1970made it illegal; it is punishable by fine and imprisonment.  The U.S Department of Agriculture is in charge of enforcing the law but soring still occurs because many judges still select these horses as winners and big money is at stake at these horse shows. Unfortunately, the USDA has little money to attend all of these shows.  Maybe the animal rights activists should spend their time stopping this type of real animal abuse rather than trying to stop equine slaughter, which in many cases actually prevents horses from suffering. A bill called HR1518 was introduced in June, 2013, into the U.S. House of Representatives that would amend the Horse Protection Act of 1970 by imposing stiffer penalties on anyone who sores a horse.  Soring is defined as the deliberate injury to the horse’s feet and legs to cause them to have a high and exaggerated gait.  There are lots of different devices trainers use to cause horses to change their gait, including metal chains as well as performance packages that add weight and height to the horse’s feet.  In some cases, The Horse magazine reports sharp or hard objects can be concealed in pads and cause pain and result in the horse stepping higher.  Some believe the bill is needed to prevent abuse of the horses while the CEO of the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, Michael Inman, says he is committed to the welfare of the horse but is disappointed in the proposed ban on pads.  Mr. Inman also indicates weighted shoes, plastic pads, and 6-ounce action devices have been shown to be non-harmful.  Current penalties for soring a horse include maximum fines up to $3,000 dollars, imprisonment up to one year or both.  The new bill, if it becomes law, would increase the maximum fine up to $5,000, imprisonment up to 3 years, or both.  The bill also would increase penalties for those who disobey disqualification orders and would also require the USDA to assign a licensed inspector if the Tennessee Walking Horse Show management indicates its intent to hire one.  The option of hiring a licensed inspector remains voluntary under the proposed bill.  Again, the bill has been assigned to the House’s Committee on Energy and Finance.

Category: Acupuncture for Axial Stiffness in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Acupuncture has been promoted in horses for years, and a new study indicates it may be effective. The Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association published a study in September 2023 concerning the short-term effects of acupuncture on steeplechase horses exhibiting axial stiffness. The axial skeleton contains the skull, vertebral column, sternum, and ribs. Axial stiffness is basically a decrease in the ability to rotate around the spine, and this study used 12 horses with axial stiffness during training. Six horses were randomly assigned to an acupuncture group, and the other six horses were not treated and were used as negative controls. Through the use of a questionnaire, each horse’s locomotion was evaluated by their rider and trainer before treatment and again at seven and 14 days after. Additionally, the improvement of the horse’s dorsal flexibility two days after treatment was evaluated individually at the trot. Expert clinicians assessed free jumping at the canter, and free jumping at the trot was objectively evaluated via internal measurement units. Results showed more horses in the acupuncture group improved on days seven and 14 compared to the non-treated control group. Subjective evaluation of the dorsal (back) flexibility also showed a significant improvement for horses receiving acupuncture treatment compared with the control horses that did not receive treatment. The authors of the study determined acupuncture may be an interesting non-drug therapy to improve clinical signs of axial stiffness and performance in steeplechase racehorses. More studies involving acupuncture and other nonstandard treatments in horses are needed, and one concern with this study is the low number of horses involved. When a smaller sample size than the ideal is used, the chance of assuming that a false conclusion is true increases.

Category: Adequan and Polyglycan in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are many products used routinely for arthritis in horses.  As far as injectable products, Adequan and Legend are two of the most used injections for treatment of arthritis; both of these products are approved for this use and have been shown to be effective.  It seems horse owners are always looking for cheaper medications that will do the same job as Adequan and Legend. In fact, many of these medications are called generics, which they are not.  A generic medication is approved by the FDA for the same purpose as the original compound and must have the same ingredients.  For example, one of the newest medications being used for arthritis in horses is a compound called Polyglycan.  Polyglycan is sometimes called a generic form of Adequan and Legend combined, which is totally incorrect.  Polyglycan has not been approved for injectable use in horses and it does not contain the same chemical as Adequan.  Also, there are no studies showing it to be effective or safe for injection in horses.  The company that manufactures Adequan performed a study on 16 horses to compare Adequan and Polyglycan in which they gave eight horses Adequan injections and eight horses received Polyglycan.  All of these horses were injected with a chemical to induce inflammation in the knee joint.  Results indicated that 88% of the horses on Adequan had less lameness while only 50% of the horses on Polyglycan had less lameness, and 48% of the Adequan horses had reduced joint swelling while none of the Polyglycan horses had reduced swelling.  Although Polyglycan and similar products may be less expensive, most are not as effective and could be dangerous when used in an unapproved manner.

Category: Are your Horse’s Feet Being Trimmed Correctly?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English I know that most of you do not trim your horse’s feet and that most farriers do a good job of trimming.  However, I still see very long toes in some horses that have recently been trimmed, and that can lead to all kinds of problems.  After your farrier trims your horse’s feet next time, pick up the front feet and look at the bottom.  If there is a large space greater than 1/8 of an inch between the hoof wall and the sole at the toe, it is likely the hoof wall at the toe was not trimmed short enough.  Also, on the front feet, the foot should be about as wide as it is long and this should be measured.  Use a tape measure and measure from the widest part of the foot across the sole and then measure from the heel to the toe.  On a front foot, these measurements should be pretty close to the same.  The toe should at least be no longer than ¼ inch when compared to the width.  And if you look at the dorsal hoof wall after the trim and the hoof wall is dished and curved toward the toe, the toe is too long. Long toes predispose horses to toe cracks. I see horses come in commonly with toe cracks and the cause in many cases is just that the toes are simply too long.  Also, the wide white line at the toe is the major cause of hoof abscesses because this gives dirt and bacteria a place to enter the hoof.  A long toe delays breakover and places more stress on the navicular bone, which can predispose some horses to navicular syndrome.  And finally, a long toe can be detrimental in foundered horses as it increases pull by the deep digital flexor tendon on the coffin bone.  Horses that have foundered commonly have long toes.  So after your horses are trimmed next time, pick up their front feet and make sure the toes are trimmed correctly.

Category: Before You Buy That Horse-Pre-Purchase Exams
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Getting a pre-purchase exam before buying a horse is a good idea, but there are many options for these exams. A pre-purchase exam can be anywhere from a thorough physical and lameness exam to multiple tests performed on the horse to determine its health. A general pre-purchase exam usually involves checking all body systems physically and then performing a lameness exam by watching the horse walk and trot to check for lameness. Your veterinarian will check for foot pain and perform flexion tests by flexing various joints to see if this affects the horse’s gait at a walk and a trot. Depending on your veterinarian and your requests, the horse you are considering buying may be ridden for the pre-purchase lameness exam. A pre-purchase evaluation does not include a positive or negative grade or whether the horse fails or passes the exam. The veterinarian’s job is to evaluate the horse medically and will probably not make any suggestions about whether you should or shouldn’t buy the horse. Depending on the purchaser and the planned use of the horse, X-rays or radiographs are sometimes performed to gain further knowledge of the horse's condition. For example, horses used for barrel racing generally have different areas of concern than racehorses, so the veterinarian may have to X-ray different areas. Some purchasers would like the upper airway examined with an endoscope, while others will request a reproductive exam if the horse will be used for breeding. If possible, the veterinarian may want to look at earlier medical records. Realize that even with a pre-purchase exam, your veterinarian does not have a crystal ball to see the horse’s future and only has to consider how the horse looks on the day of the exam.

Category: Biosecurity for Show Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you are hauling your horses from your property, biosecurity is important to prevent infectious disease.  Exposing your horses to other horses increases the risk of certain diseases like equine herpes virus, equine influenza and strangles. Vaccinations do not always prevent disease but do decrease severity of clinical signs. The vaccine for equine herpes virus, while usually effective in preventing the respiratory form and abortion, does not prevent the more serious neurological form of the disease. Vaccines to prevent strangles in your horse are available and although routinely recommended, they are not 100% protective. Dr. Chris White, DVM, states in the publication “The Horse”, that traveling and showing horses contributes to stress, lowering horses’ immunity and making them more susceptible to disease. The larger the show, the greater chance for disease transmission, as horses may be attending from all over the country. It is important to make sure your horse is currently vaccinated by your veterinarian and it’s ideal if your horse attends shows that require vaccinations of all horses.  Prevent your horses from having direct contact with other horses as much as possible, and don’t share equipment like water buckets or brushes with other show attendees.  Giving probiotics can possibly boost your horse’s immunity.  When returning home, always isolate your show horses from the rest of your herd for 3 weeks and monitor their temperatures to make sure they remain normal before adding them back in your herd. Having a separate barn for your show horses would be a good idea during show season.

Category: Cold Therapy to Prevent Laminitis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Laminitis can be caused by many diseases but regardless of the cause, the only method that has scientifically been shown to aid in preventing laminitis from occurring in most cases is cold therapy of the hoof and the tissues immediately above the hoof. Although it is commonly known cold therapy is effective, it is difficult to keep the hoof and tissues cold enough to be effective in preventing laminitis. The original study performed by Dr. Chris Pollitt in Australia indicated cooling the feet to 33.8°F (1°C) for 72 hours continually was effective in preventing laminitis. A recent study out of Cornell University tested three different methods of cooling the feet, including using a wader boot filled with a slurry of ice, a used 5-liter plastic IV bag filled with an ice slurry, and a special commercially available frozen gel pack boot. Results indicated the ice slurry in the wader boots and the plastic bag both maintained temperature that was cold enough to accomplish the goal. Unfortunately, the commercially available gel boot did not lower the temperature of the hoof enough to be effective. That is unfortunate because the gel boot would be easy to use and is low maintenance but since it was not effective, an ice slurry is needed to be effective in preventing laminitis. The ice slurry is labor intensive as ice must continually be added to the slurry to maintain the low temperature.

Category: Contagious Disease Prevention in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Recently the equine industry in the United States has been focused on equine herpes virus and preventing spread of the disease. Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about some of the measures you can take to prevent not only herpes but other contagious diseases from infecting your horses both at your stable and when hauling your horse to other facilities. Direct physical contact is required for transmission of many organisms but many organisms can also be transmitted when a person touches multiple horses without washing their hands. Also, tack, buckets, and shoes can act as inanimate carriers and spread infection when used on multiple horses, so these items should be disinfected between horses. If you travel to an event and discover horses there have been sick, it is a good idea to take your horse's temperature twice a day and anything over 101.5 degrees should be a concern. Use your own trailer when possible and avoid hauling horses from other farms. Also, all trailers should be disinfected between horses if horses are hauled from different farms; this means removing the rubber mats and cleaning thoroughly. When you take your horse to an event, try to park as far as possible from other horses and keep your horses at your trailer except when participating in the event. Riding around on your horse visiting other folks may be fun but increases the chance of your horse getting sick. And if you are at a stable with other horses, hopefully the stable has a biosecurity policy that requires all horses returning from shows be isolated for at least 2 weeks. Although this may seem extreme and may be difficult, it should be required at all stables to prevent contamination of the entire facility.

Category: Corona Virus Testing in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although we are dealing with a corona virus pandemic in humans, horses can also get sick with a different corona virus.  In horses, it is accomplished by testing the feces.  A PCR test is used similar to the onsite testing of sick people for COVID-19 but of course that test is usually performed on oral and nasal swabs.  It is believed the equine test is accurate in cases with a positive test result and clinical signs of equine corona virus, which include fever, decreased appetite, lethargy and diarrhea due to colitis.  However, these are common signs so other diseases must be ruled out.  The Horse publication indicates a recent study at Washington State tested 130 hospitalized horses for the corona virus at a teaching hospital and that half of the horses were at the hospital for a gastrointestinal illness while the other half had other diseases or were there for some elective surgery.  Results indicated only one horse was positive in the feces for corona virus, and that horse was admitted for a gastrointestinal disease.  This study indicates that corona virus is not commonly found in horse’s feces, and if it is found it is likely significant. Equine corona virus affects the intestinal tract of horses and causes colitis, diarrhea, fever, decreased appetite, and lethargy. It is contagious to other horses but not to people or other species.  And although this is a beta corona virus similar to COVID-19, it does not affect the respiratory system as COVID-19 does in people.  Bovine corona virus causes winter dysentery and respiratory disease in calves, so there are lots of corona viruses in animals and people, and testing for them is common.  It seems the fecal test for equine corona virus is a fairly accurate test if the horse has clinical symptoms.

Category: Decreasing Antibiotic Resistance in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you go out to your barn and find your horse has a nasal discharge or snooty nose and a cough, you may find out when you call your veterinarian that antibiotics will not be prescribed over the phone.  The reason for the signs could be dust, allergies or viral infection and antibiotics will not be helpful, plus – and this is significant - incorrect use can lead to antimicrobial resistance.  The development of bacteria resistant to anti-microbials is a major problem in humans and animals.  I have talked about this issue in cattle, but this is a concern in all animals including horses. Once bacteria become resistant, we have lost our ability to control their proliferation.  Dr. Wendy Vaala indicates in The Horse that without antibiotics, we will be treating infectious diseases like they did in the 1900s, which was not successful as many people and animals with infections did not survive. New antibiotics are first tested in humans and if it is unsuitable for humans, then it may be considered for use in animals.  The CDC indicates that 50% of the time antibiotics are used incorrectly, dosed improperly, or taken for the incorrect amount of time.  And it is not only animal medicine playing a role in antimicrobial resistance. Human medicine is also involved as some organisms can spread from human to human and from human to animals.  Bacterial organisms Salmonella, staph, clostridium difficile, and group A strep are becoming resistant in humans and horses, and Rhodococcus in foals is becoming resistant.  If you call your vet because your horse has a cough or an abscess in the hoof and you want antibiotics without your vet examining the horse, your vet may decline. It is not because your vet doesn’t want help, but is trying to decrease overuse of antibiotics.

Category: Dental Needs Change as Horses Age
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dental disease is certainly a problem in older horses as many of them have fewer teeth; some have fallen out or were extracted, thus making chewing difficult.  Also, there is a problem that affects mostly the incisors or front teeth in horses, a disease called EOTRH that stands for equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis.  You can see why the acronym is used when referring to this disease.  But the main issue is the teeth begin resorbing and excess cementum is produced on their root.  As the condition progresses, the teeth become inflamed, infected and painful, which can lead to a decreased appetite.  This disease affects the front teeth. Horses graze by grasping grass with their front teeth and tearing it off, so horses with EOTRH may not be able to graze because of the pain, so they will lose weight. If they can’t graze, then hay is the best forage option. Underweight horses need at least two percent of their body weight per day in forage, which is about 20 pounds for a 1,000-pound horse.  The staff at Kentucky Equine Research says that long-stem alfalfa is a good option for underweight horses because of its higher protein and energy content; a soft leafy alfalfa works best for horses with dental disease.  If you are going to feed hay cubes, first soak them long enough to soften them.  Some of these horses will require a complete feed that does not require any forage. Adding vegetable oil to the diet can add extra calories without the risk of founder or colic. Lastly, horses with EOTRH need to have their teeth x-rayed by your vet as some may need to be extracted to decrease the pain.  If your horse’s front teeth appear abnormal at the gum line, call your vet for an exam.

Category: Determining Equine Stress from Facial Expressions
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses have many different facial behaviors, and it wasn’t so long ago that those expressions were a mystery to us humans. Now, we can interpret some of these facial behaviors. The horse grimace scale has allowed researchers to see tension and pain by analyzing facial behaviors. The scale was designed to measure the amount of muscular tension held in six facial expressions visible by looking at the horse’s profile. The six expressions are: stiffly backward ears, tightening around the eyes and tension above the eye area, obviously strained chewing muscles, tight mouth, pronounced chin, strained nostrils, and flattening of the profile. Each facial expression is scored using a scale of 0 to 2; the higher the number, the more tension is noted. A horse could have a total score of 12 over 12, indicating high levels of muscular tension across the face, and this likely means there is a higher degree of pain. Using muscular tension to determine equine stress was first reported by researcher and Ph.D. Candidate Ellen Rankins from the Rutgers University Equine Science Center. The masseter muscles, on each side of the horse’s face, are the primary muscles that open and close the horse’s lower jaw. By using surface electromyography, which is the process of using electrodes on the skin to determine a muscle’s electrical activity, the masseter muscle showed significant changes when the horse was under stress. In a program for veterans with post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), eight geldings were tested to see if the program caused stress in the horses involved. We know that equine-assisted programs help humans, but this test addressed the concern about stress on horses. Using the horse grimace scale, four horses were involved in the veterans’ program, and the other four were used as test controls and were not part of the actual veterans’ program. Photographs were taken of the horse’s faces before, during, and after for comparison. The study showed that using horses in equine-assisted programs did not cause stress in their lives.

Category: Determining the Health of your Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are several markers that can indicate your horse’s level of health, according to Dr. Jennifer Zoller of the Texas A&M Animal Science Department and Extension Service.  She mentions body condition score is probably the most important and this involves looking at the fat covering along the neck, behind the shoulders, over the ribs, over the withers and around the tail head.  If the ribs can be seen, usually the score is 4 or less on a scale of 1-9 with 1 being very thin and 9 being obese.  Ideally, horses should be a 5 or 6. Horses at 8 or 9 are susceptible to developing laminitis or founder.  Any owners with horses at a scale of 4 or less or 8 or greater should have their vet examine the horse’s nutrition and make recommendations for improvement. Dr. Zoller mentions horses should have a shiny haircoat, which indicates good nutrition in most cases, and a rough haircoat could be indicative of intestinal parasites or poor nutrition.  Another area to check for your horse’s health is to check the TPR or temperature, pulse and respirations. If you are not comfortable checking your horse’s TPR, ask your vet for help.  You can also listen for gut sounds, but this takes a lot of practice and you will need a stethoscope.  Hearing intestinal sounds is good in most cases but determining what is normal takes a lot of practice.  Certainly, if you cannot hear any intestinal sounds, that is a concern.  Also, monitor the feces and note if the horse  has diarrhea or if the feces are extra dry, indicating possible dehydration.  Having all of this information for your vet can save time and help your vet diagnose your horse’s problem sooner.

Category: Dewormer Resistance Increasing in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Intestinal parasites are a common problem in horses. Intestinal parasites can have a negative effect on horse's health, and deworming medications that have been used for many decades to kill intestinal parasites have done a really good job. In fact, the dewormers have really been too effective and have been used too often over the years, which has led to resistance. Many of the dewormers that were effective 30 years ago are basically ineffective at this time against small strongyles, which is the most important equine intestinal parasite in horses today. When these dewormers first came on the market, the recommendation was to deworm all horses every 8 weeks. Unfortunately, this recommendation allowed some parasites to become resistant and using dewormers every 8 weeks only killed the susceptible parasites and allowed the resistant ones to increase. For this reason, the only deworming products that are effective at this time against small strongyles are ivermectin and moxidectin, or Quest. When these products were first released in the 80s and 90s, parasite eggs did not reappear in the feces after deworming for up to 13 weeks for ivermectin and up to 22 weeks for Quest. Now, due to horse owners continuing to deworm their horses with ineffective products and deworming too often, the reappearance of eggs after ivermectin has dropped from 13 weeks to 6 weeks and for Quest from 22 weeks to 8 weeks. For this reason, horses should not be dewormed unless their fecal samples are checked by your vet once a year. Instead of going to the feed store and buying a dewormer, have your vet check your horses and recommend which products to buy. Your veterinarian will also discuss when to use them to decrease future resistance of worms on your farm because no new dewormers are being developed.

Category: Disposal of Used Needles in a Horse Barn
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English On most farms and ranches, needles are commonly used for vaccination and administration of antibiotics and something that needs to be considered is disposing of these sharp objects safely. Human medical facilities as well as veterinary medical facilities have rules about disposing of these sharp objects and in most cases, veterinarian’s contract with companies to dispose of their sharps. However, there are concerns about the disposal of these sharp objects on the farm and the best method of doing so. The FDA is concerned about disposal of sharp objects due to other possible transmission of disease to humans and they have developed a new website to guide folks on disposing of sharp medical objects. The website iswww.FDA.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Livestock producers need to take a positive approach to the problem so that the FDA will not add any more regulations to those we already have in place. The FDA indicates it is important to place all needles and other sharps in FDA-approved containers to reduce the risk of needle sticks and punctures and these approved containers are also listed on their website. In some cases, you can place sharps in a regular heavy duty household container that is leak and puncture resistant such as a plastic laundry detergent container. When full, these sharps containers can be picked up by companies that can dispose of them and this service is fairly economical, especially since most livestock producers do not use that many needles. If you have questions, your local vet can usually help you with disposal of your sharps containers.

Category: Donkey Basics
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Donkeys are important animals throughout the world. They are used as guard animals to protect small ruminants such as sheep and goats; as companion animals; used to halter break calves and foals; and used for work in many parts of the world. Donkeys come in all sizes from minis to mammoths. Dr D.G. Pugh indicates the mini donkey hails mostly from Sardinia and Sicily and stands about three feet tall at the withers and has a dorsal cross on its backs. The burro is a smaller donkey and originally came from Spain, while a standard donkey is three to four feet tall at the withers. The large standard is four to four and a half feet tall. Mammoth donkeys are over four and a half feet tall at the withers. Sometimes horses and donkeys are bred and the combination can be confusing as a cross between a male donkey (jack) and a horse mare will be sterile; the female is called a mare or a molly mule and the male would be called a horse, stud or a john mule. Johns should be castrated and the mule will have smaller ears than the jack but longer than the mare. The mule will reflect its parentage, so a jack crossed with a gaited mare will also have refined gait. The hinney is the opposite pairing and is much less common than the mule as it is the cross between a horse stud and a female donkey (jenny) and it is less common because the conception rate is poor. Disease, vaccination and deworming programs are similar to horses except adult donkeys do not have resistance to roundworms as do adult horses, so adult donkeys need to be dewormed with products effective against roundworms. Also, trimming donkey feet is much different than trimming horse feet so choose a farrier familiar with donkeys.

Serious side effects or death can occur if you use drugs on your pet without your veterinarian's advice. It is our policy not to give dosing information over the internet. A new product has recently been introduced to the horse market that I feel is potentially dangerous for horses and their owners. Dormosedan is a sedative commonly used as an injectable by veterinarians and it works very well. However, this is a potent drug and when used without veterinary supervision, it can cause problems. With the introduction of a gel form for oral use, there are some other major concerns. Apparently, this drug was developed for the horse owner to give to the horse without a veterinarian being present. However, the advertisements fail to mention the concerns in the drug insert. First of all, impermeable gloves must be worn to use the product because humans can absorb it through the skin. The drug can cause serious side effects in people, including low blood pressure and low heart rate; the insert advises people to seek medical attention immediately after contact. In other words, if you get this drug on your hands, you should probably be driven to an emergency room or call an ambulance because you should not drive. People with heart disease or high blood pressure are especially susceptible to adverse effects. Do you really want this drug in your barn around your kids or your dogs? As far as horses, the drug should not be used in horses with heart disease that can only be diagnosed by your veterinarian before using the drug. Also, it should not be used in horses with respiratory disease, liver or kidney disease, in cases of shock, severe debilitation or stress due to extreme heat or cold, fatigue or high altitude. For these reasons, I believe only a vet should administer this product.

Category: Equine Nutrition
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Having your horses on a good nutritional program is important for their health and performance.  Nutrition is an important reason to have your veterinarian give your horses a wellness exam twice a year when they are vaccinating your horses.  If your vet does not examine your horse at the time of vaccination, ask them to do so. A nutritional consultation should be a part of this exam.  Your vet should ask about the current feeding program, assess the body condition of your horses, and consider taking samples of the feeds and hay you are using, and even the grass your horses are eating.  If you are providing a commercial feed, it is usually unnecessary to have this feed tested. However, if you feed whole grain out of the field, such as oats, or if you mix concentrates as do many folks, you probably need to get the ration tested as the feeds are not intended to be mixed and the ration could be unbalanced.  Plus, when you mix a few feeds together, you cannot determine the amount of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, fat or minerals so mixing is not recommended but if you do mix feeds, testing is a good idea.  Dr. Amanda Bradbury indicates in the Remuda publication of the Texas Equine Vet Association that current feeding practices include determining if the horses are fed together or separately, as this plays a large role in nutrition. Hay and feed samples must be collected correctly, and this includes sending in the feed mixed in the proportions you mix it, and hay samples need to be collected with a hay probe.  Also, any supplements need to be added to the mix in the amounts they are feed and sent in as this can affect the balance of the ration. Dr. Bradbury said body condition score is evaluated with three techniques including body weight, body condition score or fat cover, and muscle tone.  As far as body weight, the most accurate measurement without a scale is by using a formula including height, heart girth circumference, length and neck circumference. There is an inexpensive app for your smart phone called Healthy Horse that you can use, and you simply measure your horse in inches and plug in the numbers.  Fat cover is evaluated by using a scoring system of 1-9 with one being emaciated and nine being obese. Five to six is normal, the same as a body condition score.  Many feed companies have information on how to determine your horse’s body condition score and your vet can also help with that. I assign a body condition score to every horse I examine. Muscle tone is determined by a tool called the Topline Evaluation System that evaluates muscle development over the topline in three areas, including withers to back, mid back to croup, and hip to hindquarter.  Evaluators assess a grade of A through D for each horse, with A being ideal.  Dr. Bradbury indicates using all three techniques can give you a good overall assessment of your horse’s condition. There are many misconceptions about equine nutrition, and some of these are that processed feeds are low quality, byproducts are less nutritious than whole feeds, natural is better, commercial concentrate feeds are hot, and starch is dangerous in all horses.

Category: Equine Psychology
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Robert Miller is a veterinarian in Thousand Oaks, California, and has written several books on the psychology of horses.  He talked about the subject at the 2009 AAEP convention; speed is the horses’ principle physical characteristic that has helped them survive for thousands of years.  When you add this speed with the behavioral characteristic of flight, this is a great asset but it can also be a problem.  Many of the injuries that occur in horses are due to being frightened, and once one horse gets frightened and starts running, the entire herd will run.  Thus when working with horses, the less they are frightened they are, the less innate behavioral response will occur. Humans produce pheromones like many other species and Dr. Miller believes horses can sense these chemicals on people that approach them.  Any nervousness or anger by the handler, even if concealed, can be felt by the horse and make it more difficult to work with the horse.  Remaining calm when approaching a horse is critical to successful horse handling.  Horses can be desensitized to various stimuli but this takes time and should be accomplished when the horse is confined.  An example of this is sacking out a new horse by the trainer.  This is a technique in which the trainer ties up the horse and starts stroking him with a sack and once he gets use to the sack, the trainer is more aggressive with the sack by waving it around and desensitizing the horse to fear of moving objects.  The fear response ceases and moving objects will illicit less fright from the horse.  Be sure and join us next time for more on horse psychology.

Consequently, many horse owners want to use the dog drug Previcox for their horse because it is less expensive, and some vets have prescribed it when horse owners ask them to dispense it. Your veterinarian also wants to treat your horse with the most effective medication available and does not want you to spend more money than necessary. However, realize it is illegal for your vet to prescribe Previcox, a drug approved only for use in dogs, for your horse because the same drug is already approved for horses. There are several concerns about asking your vet to prescribe Previcox and the first is that if your horse experiences a reaction, the company will not stand behind the vet. Also, since the drug would have been prescribed illegally, the vet’s insurance will not cover the vet because an illegal prescription was written. Also, if they choose, the FDA can issue a federal indictment for the veterinarian. When people ask their veterinarians to prescribe a dog drug for a horse, they are asking those veterinarians to break the law and put their license – their livelihood - in jeopardy. So when you ask your vet to prescribe a drug that is illegal, it is not because the vet does not want to save you money, but as you can see there are serious potential consequences for the vet by doing so. Consider this when asking your vet for unapproved drugs for any of your animals.

Category: Examining your Horse's Foot
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English All horses are individuals and as such have differences in their feet. However, there are some keys that you can look for when checking a horse feet that may give you an idea that there is a problem with a hoof. First of all, the dorsal hoof wall at the front of the foot should be straight from the coronary band to the toe. Dr. Andy Parks from the University of Georgia indicates in the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) proceedings that any deviation of the dorsal hoof wall usually indicates the horse has had laminitis, especially if the surface of the wall is concave and the sole is flat. If the hoof is distorted at the front of the hoof wall at the coronary band, it is likely that the horse has excessive bone growth on the coffin bone, which is called buttress foot.  If you see a small area of swelling at the coronary band that may be painful, it is likely a hoof abscess that is going to rupture at the coronary band. If the swelling begins at the coronary band and extends up to the pastern, it is more likely an infection in the tissue, whereas if the infection is completely around the coronary band only, the problem is most likely in the coffin joint. You can also closely examine the rings in the hoof wall by looking from the side. The rings should be parallel from the coronary band to the toe and if these are not parallel, it usually indicates the heel and the toe are not growing evenly for some reason. Lastly, a lot can be learned by picking up the foot and looking at the sole and frog. The front foot should basically be as long as it is wide, and the widest part of the foot should be at a point that is at half the length. If this is not the case, the horse is trimmed incorrectly or the foot is deformed. Check your horse’s feet against these parameters and if you observe a problem ask your veterinarian.

Category: Exercise and Sweat in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Exercising horses produce a tremendous amount of heat and sweat, especially inhigh heat and humidity. This sweat is important as it allows the horse’s body to dissipate the heat produced by evaporation. Dr. Ken Marcella indicates 65% of the heat produced by a horse is dissipated by evaporation of sweat, and the horse has a lot of wasted heat to get rid of as only about 25% of the fuel taken in is used for work. To put this amount of heat in perspective, Dr. Kerry Ridgeway indicates that a horse racing at 28 miles per hour for just 2 minutes produces enough heat to bring 2 gallons of water to a boil. An endurance horse at speed loses over 3 gallons of sweat in 1 hour. While human sweat contains few electrolytes, equine sweat contains large amounts of sodium, chloride, magnesium, and potassium. Dr. Marcella indicates that although conditioning helps humans lose less electrolytes by conserving sodium, fit horses still lose about the same amount of electrolytes as unfit horses. It has been shown that some endurance horses can lose up to 75 pounds in the first 15 miles of a race. Dr. Harold Schott indicates that because horses lose a large amount of electrolytes in sweat, they do not receive adequate signals to drink after exercise even though they are dehydrated. Research has shown that offering salty water can increase water consumption after exercise. Although many commercial electrolyte replacements are available, a more effective mixture can be made with common ingredients. For electrolyte replacement, horses can be offered 1 to 2 ounces per day of a mixture of 1 pound table salt, 20 ounces lite salt, and 2 tablespoons Epson salts.

Category: Extra Label Drug Use in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In 1994, Congress added provisions to an existing law that gave veterinarians the legal ability to use approved human and animal drugs in an extra label manner. Basically the law allows vets to use approved drugs in animals even if the intended use or species is not listed on the label. However, it is not as simple as that as there are several provisions that must be met to do so. First, a vet must have recently examined the animal to make medical judgements, make a diagnosis, and be available for follow up. Then, there has to be no animal drug approved for the intended use available; the approved drug is not in the required dosage form or required concentration in your horse; or the approved drug is ineffective. In companion animals, a human drug can be used even if an animal drug is available. This is not the case in food-producing animals. To use a drug off label in food animals, it is much more difficult to satisfy the requirements because the client must maintain identification of the treated animals and the vet must determine a withdrawal period by examining appropriate scientific information. The vet must also assure no illegal drug residues occur and if the vet cannot be sure, the drug cannot be used. Another off label concern is compounded drugs and veterinarians use lots of these in companion animals. These drugs must be compounded from approved animal or human drugs and not from bulk drugs. And then there are some drugs that are completely banned from use in food-producing animals, including horses intended for food. This information is to give you an idea of the legal factors that play into a veterinarian’s choice of a drug when treating your animals and explain why limitations exist concerning the use of certain drugs.

Category: Farriers and Difficult Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English From time to time at our practice, we see horses that the farrier has a difficult time trimming and shoeing. Some of these horses will continuously pull their foot away, rear or back up, will not stand still and constantly move away from the farrier. Others will be aggressive toward the farrier and try to bite or kick. There are many possible reasons for this behavior and usually the horse is simply believed to be untrained, handled incorrectly, or had a previous bad experience with a farrier. However, the veterinarians at North Carolina State believed some of these difficult horses may be in pain and this could be causing the behavior. They performed a study on 11 horses that required sedation for foot work. Surprisingly, after two to three shoeing cycles, the horses no longer needed sedation. Now it is possible that the sedative allowed the horses to understand the shoeing was not painful and trained them. It is also possible the horses became comfortable with the farrier and the surroundings and did not require further sedation. However, both of these were considered unlikely by the authors in that the change occurred quickly after the original problem was addressed. The authors believe some horses that will not stand for the farrier and are difficult may be in pain and the pain is causing the behavior problem. Consequently, after the foot problems were treated and the pain was decreased, the horses stood better for the farrier. So if you have a horse that does not stand well for the farrier, it is possible the horse could be in pain anywhere in the leg, not just in the foot, and your vet needs to check this out before you blame it on bad behavior.

Category: Fever in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A horse’s temperature usually ranges from 99.5 to 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit. However, each horse has a temperature that is normal for that horse, so it’s a good idea to routinely check your horse’s temperature with a human rectal thermometer to know the normal range. If your horse’s temperature is always around 99.5 to 100, and you get a reading of 101.5, this is probably an increase. Dr. Joan Norton, VMD, Dipl. ACVIM indicates in the publication The Horse that it is important to check your horse’s temperature at least daily, especially if your horse travels to shows or is stabled at a barn with lots of different horses coming and going. First, you need to find out if the increase in temperature is a fever or caused by another issue. Your horse’s temperature can increase by having a high body temperature or a true fever. The brain has a set point to control temperature and sensors in the body will determine an increase. This will trigger actions like sweating to preserve the set point. Otherwise, a horse’s temperature would remain extremely high due to environmental temperature or from exercise. With hyperthermia, the body temperature rises but the set point does not so the horse is simply overheating. This can be due to exercise, a lack of sweating, or certain drugs or toxins. With high-intensity exercise, muscles produce more heat than the body can disperse, and your horse’s temperature rises. After exercise, the temperature should return to normal once your horse has cooled out. With a true fever, the set point increases, and this is due to infection or inflammation somewhere in the body. If your horse has a persistent fever, a call to your veterinarian is in order.

Category: Frequency of Joint Injections in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most joint injections are used to treat arthritis and are commonly given to performance horses. It seems the frequency of these injections is open to debate. Erin Contino, DVM, Dipl. ACVSMR, says in the publicationThe Horsethat many veterinarians are hesitant to inject joints too frequently, but frequency depends on the practitioner. Arthritis Treatment Arthritis damages cartilage and bone, which leads to inflammation. The purpose of injecting the joint is to relieve pain and lameness. There are multiple options for treating arthritis, including oral and systemic injections for pain and inflammation. Research has shown that triamcinolone, one of the medications commonly injected into joints, can protect the cartilage to some degree. Other Treatment Options Although cortisone is the most common medication used in arthritic joints, there are many others, including regenerative therapy like platelet-rich plasma and stem cells. Hyaluronic acid can be injected into joints and is commonly injected along with cortisone. Shock wave therapy has also been used in treating arthritic joints. There is no standard on how often to inject a horse’s joints, but some veterinarians try to limit joint injections to twice a year. However, you can have too much of a good thing. If the injections are effective for a shorter and shorter period, your horse's arthritis is likely worsening, and the injections are no longer effective. Again, there is no scientifically proven time interval, but if you have to have your horse’s joints injected more than twice a year, it is likely other treatments should be considered. Many trainers and owners want their horse’s joints injected on a routine basis for maintenance. Because there is always the chance of joint infection with an injection, horses should only be injected when they have a diagnosed problem in a joint.

Category: Gastrointestinal Side Effects of NSAID Use in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Pain medications are commonly used in horses, but some of them may be causing more gastrointestinal problems than previously thought. The most common pain medications used are classified as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, for short. Popular NSAIDs prescribed for horses include butazolidan (known commonly as bute), flunixin meglumine (known as Banamine®), and firocoxib (Equioxx®). Dr. Gaby van Galen, DVM, MSc, Ph.D., Dipl ECEIM, Dipl ECVECC, EBVS®, European Veterinary Specialist in Equine Internal Medicine, performed a study on 22 horses housed at her university’s hospital. These horses were not under observation for gastrointestinal issues. Some were treated with NSAIDs, and some were not. The horses were examined daily for signs of colic, depression, reduced appetite, and loose stool. Ultrasound exams, fecal occult blood testing, and serum chemistries were performed. The study found that 40% of theNSAID-treated horses had thickening of the inner lining of the intestinal tract in the upper right section of the colon after just three days of NSAID treatment. Dr. van Galen says this indicates there was a buildup of edema, or fluid, in the wall of the intestine, and some of these horses seemed uncomfortable and had decreased appetite, depression, and loose stools. These findings, along with blood testing and fecal occult blood testing, indicated these horses had mild colitis, while the untreated horses had none of these signs. The signs were mild, and it was not necessarily indicated to stop treatment, but it does show we need to be careful treating horses with bute and Banamine®, and we need to monitor them closely. Some horse owners may feel that giving NSAIDs regularly to their horses does not cause any problems, but this study shows these drugs may be causing more problems than first realized. Use of these type of drugs is not risk-free, and it is important to use as little bute and Banamine ®, or other NSAIDs, as possible. Consult with your veterinarian about NSAID use for your horse.

Category: General Anesthesia in Senior Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Anesthesia in horses is always a risk, and the older the horse, the more the risk. Dr. Lori Bidwell, DVM, DACVAA, CVA of East-West Equine Sports Medicine is an anesthesiologist, and in the publication "The Horse", Dr. Bidwell says that anesthesia of horses is a higher risk than most domestic species. Due to their large body mass and the recovery period that requires them to stand quickly after anesthesia, a horse's ability to breathe under anesthesia can be compromised. Your horse’s flight instinct prevents them from staying down until completely awake and they sometimes injure themselves trying to rise too quickly. Any anesthetic procedure longer than three hours increases the risk of complications, and this is not unusual for colic or orthopedic surgery. Field anesthesia is generally safe as it is used for shorter procedures such as castration, wound repair, or bandage changes. These horses generally recover well. Most field anesthesia cases are performed on a grassy area with plenty of room for recovery, but it is not a sterile environment. After field surgery, horses usually stand on their own while horses under longer-term anesthesia in a hospital usually require some help in standing. Horses under longer-term general anesthesia in the hospital are induced by similar drugs used in the field but since longer-acting medications are needed for longer surgery, recovery can be a problem. Most hospitals have a rope system to aid horses in standing after surgery and have a padded recovery room to prevent injury. Some have a pool filled with water for the recovery of horses to prevent injury. Monitoring anesthesia in the hospital is certainly easier than on the farm as parameters like blood pressure and oxygen administration are available in the hospital, which is more important with older horses.

Category: Genetic Testing for Equine Diseases
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Genetic testing is becoming more popular with equine organizations as we attempt to decrease the number of genetic diseases.  Dr. Carrie Finno from UC Davis and Dr. Molly McCue from Minnesota talked about equine genetic diseases and testing at the AAEP convention.  The cancer called squamous cell carcinoma is a common disease affecting Belgians and Haflingers that typically occurs with exposure to UV light.  Lesions commonly develop at junctions like the eyes, lips and prepuce, and there is a test that breeders can use before breeding to determine if a horse is susceptible.  Another genetic disease is immune-mediated myositis, which is a disease that causes rapid muscle loss in young quarter horses after exposure to infection or vaccination of certain diseases.  A test is available to determine which quarter horses might be susceptible to immune-mediated myositis. Another common genetic syndrome in quarter horses, Belgians, and Percherons is one form of tying up and this is polysaccharide storage myopathy, or PSSM.  It occurs in a least 30 breeds so if you plan to breed or even buy a horse, it might be a good idea to test for this disease.  Another form of tying up is due to type 2 PSSM but there is no genetic test for it and a muscle biopsy is required for diagnosis. Another disease that may be genetic is equine asthma, previously called heaves.  This disease may be related to multiple genes, but no test is available at this point. The American Quarter Horse Association has taken the lead in genetic testing so it may appear that quarter horses have more genetic diseases than other horses, but that is not true. The large number of quarter horse tests available that exist are because the quarter horse folks have been more aggressive at testing, which is a good thing.

Category: Honey Used for Horse Wounds Should Be Medical Grade
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses have fairly thin skin for the size of the animal, so lacerations are common.  Numerous materials have been used to heal horse wounds and some aid in healing and many actually decrease healing.  One product that has shown promise in treating horses’ wounds is medical grade honey, which is different than the honey you have in your refrigerator for human consumption.  Medical grade honey has been sterilized by gamma radiation to eliminate any naturally occurring bacteria and it appears to improve healing rates in naturally sustained wounds. Dr. Gal Kelmer said in The Horse that veterinarians have seen improved healing after applying medical grade honey to wounds before suturing as decreased infection was noted at time of suture removal.  A study in which all veterinarians involved were to repair wounds in the normal manner except some were to apply medical grade honey in the wounds prior to suturing and the others were not.  The study involved 127 horses, 69 of which were treated with medical grade honey. Their lacerations were anywhere from 1 inch long to 15 inches long on multiple areas of the horse’s body.  The major difference in healing appeared to be due to the non-healing wounds developing infections and the fully healed wounds were not infected.  Results indicated 50% of the honey-treated horses healed completely while only 31% of the non-treated horses healed completely before suture removal.  Honey’s natural antibacterial properties likely contributed to the improved healing by warding off infections without the concern of antibiotic resistance developing as it appears bacteria do not develop resistance to medical grade honey.

Category: Horse Hay and Pasture Testing for the Winter
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English As we enter the fall and winter, the pasture grass is declining in quality and we will be needing to feed hay to our horses.  In the past, you just called the feed store or hay supplier and told them you needed hay, but now we know that all hays are not the same.  With the discovery of Cushing’s disease or PPID and equine metabolic syndrome, we now know that many of these horses need a low-carbohydrate ration. Grass hay can have anywhere from 5 to 35 percent carbohydrates as reported by Equianalytical Lab.  Since horses with insulin resistance need to be eating hay that is less than 10 percent nonstructural carbohydrates, if you have insulin-resistant horses, it is important to know the carbohydrate values of the hay before you buy it.  Hopefully, your hay dealer tests their hay but if they do not, ask them to do so. If you test the hay yourself, you will need a hay probe, an electric drill, and a one-quart plastic bag to contain the sample.  You would want to sample at least 10 bales and should send at least a pound of hay to the lab.  If you also want to sample the pasture, take about 20 samples at different areas and with scissors, cut off the portion of the plant the horse is eating.  So, if the horse is not eating close to the ground, do not sample that portion.  Cut up the grass in two-inch segments and mix it thoroughly.  Testing is available for all parameters in hay and pasture if you want to do it. If you are a hay producer, this would be a good idea.  However, if you have horses that are resistant to insulin, you can just ask for a starch panel as these tests are fairly inexpensive and certainly worth the money.  Many labs can provide this information.

Category: How Often Should you Bathe your Horse?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Lots of folks bathe their horses frequently, especially if they are show horses, but is this really good for the horse?  Bathing your horses frequently can cause some skin issues for your horse.  Dr. Lori Bidwell indicates in The Horse publication that some show horses get bathed three times a day and put up in their stalls still damp. Removing dried sweat, dirt and debris is necessary, especially after riding, because foreign material between the horse and the saddle can damage the skin causing infection and pain.  Grooming even without bathing can remove some of this debris.  You may also find infections, parasites, tumors, cuts and abrasions you might have otherwise missed.  Soap does not need to be used when bathing as soap itself is a chemical produced by mixing some sort of fat with a base to create a salt called saponification.  However, lots of shampoos have other added ingredients that may or may not be good for the animal’s coat because some of these can irritate the skin. Using these products sometimes is helpful to really clean the skin well but overusing them can strip the skin of its normal, healthy microbial populations as well as natural oils and sebum.  Skin infections can occur due to over-washing because the normal bacterial flora is removed by shampooing and can allow overgrowth of disease-causing bacteria.  Drying the skin can also lead to itching and rubbing, which allows skin infections to occur.  When you do bathe your horse, make sure and dry the coat as moisture alone can irritate the skin.  Although bathing is a treatment for some skin problems, it can cause other skin issues.  Bathing with a shampoo that is soap-free, mild, and contains aloe and oatmeal is a good idea if frequent bathing is required.

Category: Hydrotherapy Used in Equine Rehabilitation
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Rehabilitation of human patients after injury is common and it is becoming more common in equine medicine. One of the most common forms of rehabilitation in horses is hydrotherapy. Cold water hydrotherapy cools the tissues, decreasing pain by reducing conduction velocity of peripheral nerves. Also, cooling decreases the metabolism of the tissues reducing requirements for oxygen and glucose. Cooling also causes constriction of blood vessels which decreases bleeding and inflammation. For this kind of cold water benefit, spraying cold water on the leg is not enough. Ice is required because tissue temperatures need to get down to 10°C to reach the tissues. Alternating therapy of cold and heat can also be helpful for treating soft tissue injuries by increasing blood flow to tissues. Cold constricts the blood vessels, while heat dilates them, increasing blood flow. However, it is very difficult to consistently heat the tissue to 40°C and then cool it to 15°C. A cold water leg spa that sprays the leg with cold salt water and air to help decrease swelling and increase oxygen to the tissue has been used but there are no studies to support this use. Underwater treadmills are commonly used for horses and have been shown to be effective for improved limb function and range of motion. The underwater treadmill is also helpful for some cardio work and is better than swimming for targeting specific joints. Although swimming is great exercise, it should not be used for injured horses or horses with respiratory dysfunction as swimming horses hold their breath after inspiration.

Category: Influenza Vaccination in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine influenza or flu is a common contagious disease in horses. Clinical signs include fever, nasal discharge, and a persistent dry hacking cough that may last for several weeks. Horses usually recover from the disease in several weeks unless a bacterial infection develops as a consequence of the original problem. You may be think that your horse is not susceptible because he's been vaccinated for the flu, and hopefully you are correct. However, Dr. Steve Grubbs from Boehringer indicates in the Remuda magazine that all influenza vaccines are not created equal because the influenza virus undergoes a process called antigenic drift. In antigenic drift, the proteins on the surface of the virus change, and even a small change makes the vaccine less effective or sometimes ineffective. For this reason, human flu vaccines are reformulated yearly to keep up to date with the most current strains, and it is just as important for equine vaccine companies to keep up too. An equine surveillance panel made up of experts monitors current strains of equine influenza worldwide, and makes recommendations for viral strains that should be included in the vaccines. So not all flu vaccines for horses may be up to date as different vaccines have different strains, and the most effective ones are the ones that are regularly updated. To determine the best vaccine for your horse, consult with your veterinarian to make sure you are doing the best you can to protect him. Choosing your vaccine from testimonials on a website or by price is not a good plan as it is more likely these options will lead to vaccine failure and will be more expensive in the long run.

Category: Injecting Alcohol into Horse's Hock Joints
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most performance horses will, at some point, develop problems with their lower two hock joints. Arthritis and inflammation of these joints can cause lameness and decreased performance. These joints are commonly treated with cortisone and hyaluronic acid in the joint to decrease pain and inflammation. Another treatment is to surgically remove the cartilage from the joint surfaces to allow the joints to grow together; this prevents pain in the joint and since these joints move very little anyway, performance is not affected. A new treatment has been reported using 70% ethyl alcohol that is injected into the joints. This alcohol chemically destroys the cartilage in the joint and allows the joint to grow together, or ankylose, without surgery. Ethyl alcohol is essentially rubbing alcohol and it is certainly less expensive than surgery. A recent study was performed, and reported at the AAEP convention, in 11 horses that were proven to have arthritis in the lower hock joints. All were injected with 3cc ethyl alcohol and 10 of the 11 horses were still sound one year after the injections. This outcome is in contrast to injecting the joints with cortisone, which may last 2 to 3 months. It is interesting to note that none of the joints were fused but the horses were still sound so maybe the alcohol has an effect on the nerves that innervate (supply with nerves) the joint surface. The disadvantage of alcohol injection is that you must be very careful that all of the alcohol goes only in the lower two hock joints and does not enter the top joints, and that the alcohol does not diffuse in the soft tissue around the joint as a reaction could occur.

Category: Injuries in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses are quite prone to injuries. Many times owners examine these injuries and if they look small, people assume they aren't a big deal. However, the size of the wound is not as important as the location. Any wound at the knee, or hock, and below is potentially serious and could even be deadly as there are some really sensitive structures in this area and very little soft tissue covering the bones and joints. Even a half-inch puncture in the wrong place can be devastating because it can enter a tendon sheath or a joint. Infections in tendon sheaths and joints are emergencies. So anytime your horse has a lower leg wound and the skin is broken, call your veterinarian because if you wait to see what happens, it may be too late, besides which if treatment is possible it will be even more expensive. The vet may need to sedate the horse and use a nerve block to examine the area; it may be necessary to take samples of the joint or tendon sheath fluid, or inject these structures with an anti-inflammatory or local anesthetic drug to determine whether they are affected. If tendon sheath and joint infections are not treated early and aggressively, treatment may not be successful. If your horse has a swollen leg or is lame, don't just assume it is a sprain or a bruise. It is important to examine the leg carefully, and if you find a wound of any type, regardless of the size, understand that it could be serious. Some of my clients would start giving their horse pain medication like bute without calling a vet, and the horse would get better for a few days and then be much worse. By then, many of those horses were so infected that treatment was unsuccessful. For this reason, if you find a wound, never give your horse bute without having your vet check your horse first.

Category: Insect Bite Allergies Helped by Omega 3 Fatty Acids in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When the weather gets warmer the number of flying insects increases, and many horses are allergic to insect bites.  Horses that are allergic to insect bites have a significant reaction that causes them to scratch and rub their skin, and they are very uncomfortable.  Some will scratch and rub enough to lose hair and even develop severe skin infections. All of this is commonly called sweat itch.  The lesions commonly occur on the midline of the horse’s belly but can occur over the back as well as the main and tail areas.  Treatment of the condition requires insect control, sometimes cortisone to decrease the allergic response, and antibiotics if the horse has an infection.  However, cortisone can only be used short term and it can lead to founder, so it is not a good option in the long term. Another option for the allergy may be omega 3 fatty acid supplementation.  This therapy is used in dogs with allergies; researchers at the University of Guelph indicated they tested horses using flaxseed, which is a good source of omega 3 fatty acids.  Horses were fed flax meal daily for six weeks and then some were injected with Culicoides extract, which is one of the flies typically involved with the syndrome.  The horses that were fed the flax meal had a significant reduction in skin reaction compared to horses that weren’t.  If your horse has skin allergies to flying insects, feeding omega 3 fatty acids may help.  The only concern I have about the study is that the horses used were not reported to be allergic to flying insects so although the itching decreased, so I don't know if feeding flax seed will make a significant difference in itchy horses but it is worth a try.

Category: Intramuscular Injection Complications
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Intramuscular injections are commonly given to horses by veterinarians and animal owners, and it is not uncommon for complications to occur. The most common one is infection and abscessation at the injection site and in most cases, the infection is due to introducing bacteria in the tissue when the needle is advanced in the skin; this occurs with two methods. First, if the needle is not sterile or if there is a large amount of bacteria on the skin, the bacteria is taken into the wound on the outside of the needle. Secondly, when a needle pierces the skin, a process called coring occurs in which a tiny piece of skin is cut off by the needle and taken deep into the tissue. Along with the tiny piece of tissue, bacteria and tiny pieces of hair can be taken into the tissue as well. It has been shown that the smaller size of the needle used, there is less potential for coring and thus less tissue is taken into the muscle. Also, clipping the hair actually increases the amount of hair taken into the tissues, and shaving the injection sites increases coring. A study was performed in Germany using 18 gauge needles and 22 gauge needles and results indicated that skin coring was increased in haired skin with the larger gauge needles. So when vaccinating your horse or giving an injection, using the smallest gauge needle possible should decrease the change of infection. Now, this is assuming that the hair coat is not soiled, in which case cleaning it first may be required. However, in general, clipping the hair from an injection site actually increases the chance of infection. If you are giving an injection to your horse, make sure you are using the smallest needle possible, clean the area but don’t clip the hair or shave the site, and use a sterile needle.

Category: Know your Horse’s Normal Temperature
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Rectal temperature is an important clinical parameter in all animals.  With horses, rectal temperature is commonly used in disease outbreak situations such as herpes virus or strangles, to determine if exposed horses are developing an infection.  However, you have to know the normal rectal temperature to determine if a specific horse has an increased temperature, and although there is a normal temperature range published for horses, that is not necessarily correct for all horses. There are several parameters that can have an effect on rectal temperature and one is the placement of the thermometer and the type used.  Long rectal mercury thermometers have been shown to have a difference of almost 2°F in one study compared to a short digital thermometer such as you would purchase for humans.  It is important to use a similar type of thermometer every time, and insert the thermometer in the horse’s rectum the same distance every time.  The recommendation is to insert the digital thermometer in the rectum up to the read-out area or about 2 ½ inches, and when you do so, make sure the thermometer is not stuck in a ball of feces but is angling so the tip is in contact with the rectal mucosa.  Stress and exercise can also affect rectal temperature. A study in England found that horses at different stables can have different temperatures than horses at other stables.  In this study, the horses at one stable had normal temperature ranges from 96.8°F to 100.4°F. The important point is to take your horse’s temperature with the same thermometer in the same manner every time so you will know your horse’s normal temperature, rather than relying on a range for all horses.

Category: Laparoscopy is Minimally Invasive Surgery in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have a male horse that you would like to get castrated but only one of his testicles has descended, then surgery is much more complicated than in a typical castration. In the past, the surgeon would have to use a longer-lasting anesthetic than for a normal castration, make a fairly large incision in the horse's abdomen, and sometimes even insert the veterinarian's entire hand into the abdomen to find the testicle. This large incision caused significant post-operative pain and longer healing time. However, this procedure is now being performed by board-certified surgeons at referral centers with a laparoscope, providing minimally invasive surgery. Don't expect every local veterinarian to have this equipment because it is expensive and requires a lot of extra training. Laparoscopy involves the use of a telescope and a camera to look inside the abdomen at all of the organs there. It requires two to three incisions that are less than 1 inch in length that heal quickly, and with much less pain than a large abdominal incision. Instruments are inserted through these small incisions. In the case of a retained testicle, the testicle is identified and removed. With the laparoscopic technique, Dr. John Janicek from Bertram, Texas, indicates that with any type of surgery it is used for, time spent in the hospital is decreased, pain is less, and the smaller incisions are more cosmetic. Also, some of the procedures can be performed with the horse standing, which prevents an anesthetic and recovery problem. And every time you anesthetize a horse and lay it down, there is always a risk of recovery problems when they attempt to stand. Many other equine abdominal procedures besides castration can also be performed with the laparoscope.

Category: Laser Therapy in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Low-level laser therapy may be helpful in some equine conditions, says Dr. Leah Walker from Arizona.  It is being used in treating many conditions in animals.  Dr. Walker indicates in the Remuda publication that laser therapy is noninvasive but owners having horses treated must have reasonable expectations of what it can do. Class 4 lasers are usually used in horses, and these are different from surgical lasers as they are classified as therapy lasers or regenerative lasers. Lasers can be used in acute or chronic conditions. Dr. Chris Morrow from Amarillo says he has noted increased healing of wounds by using the laser. He believes it sterilizes the tissue.  Also, incisions can be treated after surgery to aid in healing.  Dr. Sherry Johnson from Whitesboro says lasers have been used in human athletes to improve muscle strength and accelerate post-exercise recovery and this may also be effective in horses.  Veterinarians at Park Equine in Kentucky have seen promise in treating splint bone fractures in horses as the laser is also used to accelerate bone healing in humans. The concern with lasers is most of the time they are being used along with other treatments, so it is difficult to determine how much the laser is helping.  There is also very little information on the correct dosage and frequency of laser treatment to best treat specific conditions.  It has been shown that in horses the laser penetrates light-colored skin better than dark-colored skin, which has an effect on the correct dosage.  The success of laser therapy on healing depends on the injury and the ability of the horse to heal, and this includes underlying conditions and temperament.

Category: Longeing’s Potential Effect on Your Horse’s Joints
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Longeing is the exercise of working a horse in a circle on a long lead while the trainer stands in the middle of the circle as the horse moves around the trainer. It’s a common method of exercising horses, but there is some concern that this procedure could damage equine joints. Dr. Brian Nielsen, PhD, MS, PAS, Dipl. ACAN, writes in the publicationThe Horsethat there is some anecdotal evidence supporting the relationship between circular exercise and joint disease. As anecdotal evidence is not proven by scientific studies, Michigan State University is starting a project to determine how much damage may occur depending on the size of the circle and the speed at which the horse is exercising. The concern with the circular exercise is that while turning, the load-bearing surface of the joint is greatly reduced, so the load is increased on the load-bearing part of the joint. Another way of saying this is that the force that normally gets distributed equally over the entire joint surface in straight-line exercise is concentrated on a much smaller area when exercising in a circle. This is unlikely to be a problem if done infrequently or at slow speeds, but longeing your horse at higher speeds as part of a training program day after day could cause joint damage. Dr. Nielsen says it would be the same for us if we were to run in a small circle. It’s likely we would develop knee and ankle pain over time. Horses are also much heavier than humans, and yet their leg joints are not that much larger compared to their weight. Joint injuries and arthritis are extremely common in horses, and we don’t want to do anything during training to injure their joints.

Category: Magnetic Blankets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The use of magnetic blankets and other magnetic products for animals has been reported to be effective at preventing disease, decreasing muscle soreness, increasing wound healing and decreasing pain by increasing blood flow to the tissues. Many people also say the magnets give a calming effect. However, there is little scientific information indicating magnets are effective at increasing blood flow or calming the animal. A group of veterinarians in Sweden published a study in the Equine Veterinary Journal where they measured blood flow to the muscle under magnets, skin temperature, changes in muscle tenderness and behavior changes by using the magnetic blanket. Ten horses were used in the study, and magnetic blankets that contained 120 static magnets rated at 900 gauss/magnet were used on the horses while regular blankets were also used as a placebo control. Results indicated there was no significant differences between blood flow to the muscle of horses wearing the magnetic blankets versus those wearing regular blankets. Athough skin temperature increased slightly in horses wearing the magnetic blankets, it also increased when wearing the placebo blanket with no magnets and skin temperature was back to normal in both groups in just 15 minutes after removing the blankets. Skin sensitivity was not improved in horses wearing magnets compared to those just wearing a regular blanket. There was also no calming effect noted due to the blankets so although the magnetic blankets may be effective, it is not because of increasing blood flow to the tissues and more studies are needed to determine if these is a positive effect of magnetic blankets in horses.

Category: Managing Older Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Amanda Adams from Merck Animal Health indicates that almost 30% of the horses in the U.S. are over 15 years of age, which is due to better veterinary care and better nutrition. However, we now have some problems in these horses that we did not have 30 years ago when the horse population was younger. As horses age, their immunity to fight off infection is not as strong. Because of this fact, older horses may also not respond to vaccination as well as younger horses. It has been shown that older horses, like older humans, are more susceptible to influenza than younger animals and humans even if they have pre-existing immunity. When vaccinating older horses, it is important to talk with your veterinarian as all vaccines are not the same and choosing one by cost is not a good plan. In general, there are two types of vaccines: killed and modified live. Killed vaccines stimulate mostly antibody responses, while modified live vaccines stimulate cell-mediated immunity and antibody responses. The best vaccine for your horse depends on your specific situation and the specific disease you are trying to prevent. Your vet can help you make the best decision for your horse. Another major problem of older horses is dental disease and only your veterinarian is capable of thoroughly examining your horse's mouth and making treatment recommendations. Equine dentistry is more than just floating the teeth. The condition of the teeth and the horse's overall health play a major role in recommending the appropriate feed. Some older horses have dental disease that requires x-rays to diagnose correctly, and untreated dental disease causes pain and can lead to sinus infections and bone disease. The most common problems with older horses are obesity and endocrine diseases including equine metabolic syndrome and Cushing's disease. These diseases are complicated, but one important factor is to make sure your horse is not overweight. The reason this is so important is that many of these overweight horses are insulin resistant and have equine metabolic syndrome; many also have Cushing's disease. Both of these diseases lead to laminitis and founder, which is a painful hoof condition than can lead to permanent lameness and even death. Hopefully, your horses are being examined by your vet twice a year and these kinds of problems have been discussed. Testing is available for both these syndromes and treatment is also available. If your horse has either equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing's disease, it is critical to treat them before laminitis develops. If laminitis has already occurred, x-rays of the feet should be taken. Working with a farrier and a veterinarian familiar with treating this syndrome is necessary. I cannot stress enough how important early diagnosis of these diseases is in preventing pain and suffering in your older horse. And with Cushing's disease, your horse does not have to be overweight and may not have any clinical signs. If you have an older horse, ask your vet about screening for equine metabolic syndrome and Cushing's disease with a blood test for early detection of these serious diseases.

Category: Microchipping in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses are legally identified by a number of methods including lip tattoos, branding, and physical description. All of these have their disadvantages as tattoos and brands fade and become unreadable, while a physical description is fairly vague and can match multiple horses. Microchips are the best method to accurately identify a horse, which is necessary in the case of theft or a natural disaster such as a hurricane in which animals are lost over many miles, and finding the owners is almost impossible without a microchip. The United States does not have a microchip requirement for horses but it is becoming more common as the Jockey Club began requiring microchips to register thoroughbred foals starting this year and most European countries require microchipping of thoroughbreds. The USEF required all horses registered in the Hunter Jumper Association to be microchipped by December 1, 2017, to be able to accumulate points earned in competition. Also, the FEI has required all horses in their registry to be microchipped since 2013.By 2019, all horses competing in USEF events will have to be microchipped. Also, all thoroughbred foals registered through the Jockey Club born in 2017 and after will have to be microchipped. However, when you look at the number of horses in the United States, only about one percent are microchipped at this time, and the limiting factor has been a database to search for the chip number. Without a database, the chip number is useless. We have online databases in dogs and cats that you can go to and find the owner, but we have not had this in horses. However, a tool to look up microchips in horses has been started at equinemicrochiplookup.org, and hopefully this will increase the number of chipped horses and enable animal health authorities to trace horses with disease and find lost horses in disaster situations. Talk with your vet about microchipping your horse. Inserting a microchip in a horse is not a big deal. The chip is inserted in the middle third of the neck on the left side. Some horses will require sedation and local anesthesia because the microchip is contained in a fairly large needle, but most horses don't need it. It is important that the veterinarian use a 15-digit microchip and perform a surgical prep on the site to prevent infection when implanting the chip. The microchips can be read by any universal scanner and the chip numbers can be stored by the veterinarian as well as the owner.

Category: Moldy Hay Fed to Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Moldy hay is a year-round concern but most of the reasons hay develops mold are related to problems at harvest. Dr. Sally Flis at Equi-Analytical Lab indicates there is a concern for moldy hay because the if mold develops during storage, there is a loss of dry matter in the hay plus a loss of total digestible nutrients because mold eats the hay before your horse can. The other issue is that moldy hay can cause major issues with the horse's respiratory tract and can cause allergic reactions. Some horses are extremely sensitive to the allergens in mold and this can lead to inflammatory airway disease. Many horses with heaves or COPD are very sensitive to environmental allergens in the hay and will have a difficult time breathing if fed moldy hay. Lastly, most horses do not like to eat moldy hay so there may be a palatability problem. Mold can develop on hay through several methods, and one is that if the weather is cool and wet, mold can develop on grass before it is even cut to bail. If it is cool and wet, hay takes longer to dry because the soil is wet and the hay absorbs moisture from the wet soil. Also, many times hay gets rained on after being cut and before bailing and the longer it takes to dry, the greater the chance of mold developing. Raking the hay to facilitate drying soon after a rain will help decrease the amount of mold growth. Baling hay that has a moisture content greater than 14 percent will increase the chance of mold developing. If you feel your hay has mold but are not sure, you can have the hay tested to determine the risk of using it as not all moldy hay has to be discarded; depends on the level of mold.

Category: Mosquito Control Tips for Horse Owners
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses can be affected by mosquitos just like humans, so it is a good idea to have a plan on your farm to control mosquitos.  TheAmerican Mosquito Control Associationsays that more than 200 of the 2500 existing species of mosquitos are active in the United States.  Mosquitos are carriers of Eastern and Western Encephalomyelitis viruses and West Nile Virus and can transmit these diseases to horses and humans. The diseases in horses cause neurological dysfunction with fever and are sometimes fatal. Horses tormented by mosquitos may not eat well. They may also develop allergic reactions and skin infections from mosquito bites. For mosquito control eliminate areas of standing water by removing or drilling holes in all containers that could retain water such as old tires or tarps on the ground. Keep weeds mowed especially around ponds and ditches so fish, birds, and bats can hunt mosquito larvae more effectively. There are also some biocontrol substances you can add to the water such as bacteria that kill mosquito larvae. Change biocontrol substances periodically to prevent resistance from developing. The key to preventing West Nile and Western and Eastern Encephalomyelitis in horses is to make sure your horses arevaccinatedagainst these diseases at least once a year. Some fly sheets made for horses will also prevent mosquito bites or at least decrease bites under the sheet. Mosquitos are bothersome for your horse, and they can cause a lot more problems than just skin disease so it is best to put control measures in place.

Category: Nails in a Horse’s Foot can be Deadly
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It is fairly common for horses to step on nails and have the nail puncture the foot. So if you notice your horse limping, pick up the foot and find a nail, what should you do? Most people would just pull the nail out and not worry about it. Well, both of those answers are wrong. It is important to leave the object in the horse's foot until the vet arrives so x-rays can be taken to see what structures the nail may have entered. If the horse is really lame and the nail is sticking below the sole, you do not want the horse stepping on it to drive it any deeper so you may have to pull it out. If you must remove it, mark the entry spot so your vet can find it and check the direction because a probe will need to be placed in the hole and the area x-rayed. If possible, leave the object in the foot but cut it off so it will not be pushed further in the foot and wrap the foot with loose cotton to pad and protect it until the vet arrives. A nail or other object that enters the horse's foot can be extremely serious and even deadly. The reason is if the nail has entered a joint or tendon sheath and causes an infection, the infection can be difficult to cure - sometimes impossible. Some of these horses are in such pain due to infection in the area that euthanasia may be required so that is the reason I say a nail in the foot can be deadly. So if you find that a nail or other object has punctured the sole of your horse's foot, don't just pull it out but call your vet and ask for advice. And these infections may take a day or two to become painful from infection so even if you do pull out the nail and your horse appears normal, this does not mean a problem will not develop. If you wait until your horse becomes lame, it may be too late. It is also important to make sure your horse is up to date on tetanus vaccine if any type of wound occurs. Tetanus vaccines should be given annually to all horses.

Category: New Information About Horse Deworming
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you are still deworming your horse every one to two months as we did 40 years ago, you are likely allowing resistant parasites to develop. A recent study showed that this resistance occurs fairly quickly. Dr. Thomas Geurden, Head of EU Global Clinical Development, Statistics and Data Management at Zoetis, Brussels, performed a study on two draft horse farms that practiced intensive calendar-based deworming. Regardless of the need, the horses were dewormed four times a year with 2% Moxidectin, or six times a year with ivermectin. To check for drug resistance, a stool analysis was checked for parasite eggs. The analysis showed that parasite eggs reappeared twice as fast on the farms studied due to resistance, as is normally the case. Because of this resistance, scientists involved in the study checked fecal egg counts in all horses every two weeks from April to September for three years. Horses with high fecal egg counts received a different dewormer, and the rest of the horses were only dewormed twice a year. This deworming program effectively decreased the total deworming needed by one-third, showing this alternative method of deworming was highly effective in controlling fecal egg counts at normal levels in both herds and slowed the drug resistance of the parasites up to 300%. The horses that did require three treatments per year instead of two were generally younger horses with less immunity to fight off parasites. This study proved that horses did not need to be dewormed every 2-3 months and deworming less actually decreased resistance and was more effective. Fecal egg counts in stool samples are routine for your veterinarian and the test is usually inexpensive.

Translating Return to English Taking your horse’s temperature is a good thing to be able to do if your horse seems sick and you want to call your veterinarian.  This information, along with pulse and respiration, can help your vet determine if the horse needs to be seen.  However, taking the temperature with a rectal thermometer can be challenging on some horses, especially if they have not been trained to allow it.  You have to find your thermometer and hope it is still working. Then usually you need to find someone to hold your horse as it is really not safe on most horses to take a rectal temperature by yourself.  You also have to make sure the thermometer is touching the rectal mucosa and not stuck in a ball of manure in the rectum because you will not get an accurate reading. Because of issues with taking a rectal temperature, a veterinarian in France indicated in The Horse magazine that she had developed a microchip that not only identifies your horse but also provides the temperature.  The microchip is injected in the horse’s, neck like all other microchips, and reads the internal temperature.  Testing on the prototype has revealed that the microchip temperature device is as accurate with less fluctuations than taking a rectal temperature.  While the current system requires you to scan the horse to get the temperature, the researchers are working on a connection to a phone app that would give you the temperature just by going to the app.  Microchips that also determine temperature are already available for other species of animals so it is likely this will be available for horses in the near future.  This will be very beneficial for large farms, especially in disease outbreak situations during which you need to check temperatures on large numbers of horses twice a day.

Category: Non-Chemical Parasite Control for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most horses should be dewormed at least once yearly for tapeworms and usually twice a year for other parasites.  However, the deworming frequency should be determined by the results of a fecal egg count, not from past experiences. Many people also want to use nonchemical dewormers as they are afraid of chemicals and feel that a natural approach is better.  However, natural substances are also chemicals and can be just or more toxic, and they are not regulated by the FDA as no testing is performed. Dr. David Ramey reports in Veterinary Practice News that there is no effective method of killing internal parasites without chemicals.  Certainly, you can take steps to control parasites, including removing manure from the pasture.  However, some parasites will remain and must be treated.  Some may point out that wild horses do not suffer from parasite problems but the difference is that wild horses roam thousands of acres and are not confined to a small area where manure and parasite eggs can accumulate. Many natural supplements are claimed to control intestinal parasites, including pumpkin seeds, carrots, turnips, beets, garlic, bacterial supplements, wheat bran, and wheat germ oil.  However, all of these natural remedies have been shown to be ineffective in killing intestinal parasites.  Herbal dewormers are also available and regardless of their claims, there is no evidence they control internal parasites. Lastly, the most used may be diatomaceous earth for external insect parasites, which is about 80% silica.  Used in gardens, it absorbs moisture from the external skeleton of insects and dries them out.  However, the environment must be dry, which cannot be achieved in a horse’s intestine.  Studies in goats, sheep, and cattle have shown diatomaceous earth to be ineffective and no studies have actually been performed in horses.

Category: Oral Joint Supplements in Senior Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There are literally hundreds of oral joint supplements on the market for horses. If you look at a horse magazine, it seems about half of the ads are for joint supplements and all claim to be the best. Marketing of these products is crazy, and they all have testimonials from successful horse folks and theories about why your horse has to have their product. In reality, only a few of these products are actually backed by scientific studies supporting their claims, and scientific studies have proven that about only 10% of these products actually contain the ingredients they list on the label. You may be wondering how this is possible because aren't all products required to be tested? Unfortunately, they are not, and these oral joint supplements are listed as feed supplements instead of drugs so the FDA does not regulate them. And then the other question is do these oral joint supplements really work as the advertisements say they do? To answer this question, researchers at the University of Utrecht tested the effectiveness of one oral joint supplement to see if it improved gait stiffness in older horses over a three-month period. The researchers took 24 older horses and divided them into two groups. Only one group was given the supplement. The supplement contained glucosamine, chondroitin and MSM. Results indicated there was no significant improvement is stride length, knee flexion, fetlock extension, or hock range of motion. This does not mean that all of the joint supplements do not help horses. It does indicate, however, that it is best to ask the manufacturer for scientific proof rather than relying on testimonials.

Category: Pain Determination in a Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Sometimes it is easy to determine when horses are in pain, but sometimes, especially with chronic pain, it is difficult to know. Dr. Claudia Sonder from UC Davis indicates that like humans, horses can display involuntary facial expressions that communicate stress, fear and pain. And they can display these expressions in subtle ways as just a change in the shape of the mouth, eye or nose can tell us whether the animal is in pain. UC Davis has a large herd of horses with chronic painful conditions such as arthritis, laminitis and navicular disease and so they had the ideal situation to study these horses in pain. The group set out to create software that would map the horse’s face and then make a program to read the faces and expressions displayed. The team used pictures of humans and then pictures of horses to map the facial expressions, while videos were used to assess stress, fear, boredom and anxiety in the animal’s faces. It is hopeful that the program can help veterinarians determine if horses are in pain when it is not obvious otherwise. More data is required but Dr. Sonder believes this will allow vets to treat animals faster by understanding that they are in pain from just their facial expressions. In one case, Dr. Sonder was able to look at a mare who appeared normal but the shape of her nostrils indicated she was in pain; further analysis revealed she had a major problem. Eventually, it is hopeful that vets will have a computer program available in their offices to aid in determining pain in horses. It is also possible this technology could be used in cats, dogs and other animals to determine if they are in pain; it would be especially helpful if they are in the hospital and their pain medication is wearing off and another dose is needed.

Category: Pain Indicators in Ridden Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Sue Dyson from England has developed an ethogram to determine pain in ridden horses.  An ethogram simply a catalog of behavioral signs in an animal and she indicates it is sometimes difficult to determine if a ridden horse is painful, so she developed and validated a catalog of behaviors that a horse might display under saddle when in pain.  She tested her ethogram using individuals with no specific training by using nerve blocks to numb painful areas and noted the responses of the evaluators before and after the numbing or blocking process. After much research, she cataloged 24 behaviors and indicated that if 8 or more of the 24 behaviors were present, the horse was likely in pain.  And although the ethogram was successful in identifying pain, training on the technique was required to better identify the lame and painful horses.  Potential pain-indicating behaviors on the facial area included ears rotated back, eyes closed or semi-closed, being able to see the sclera or white portion around the eyes, and an intense stare.  Also, opening the mouth regularly, exposing the tongue and moving it in and out of the mouth, and pulling the bit through the mouth to the left or right.  Body movements potentially indicating pain include repeated head position changes or head tilt, moving the head side to side, tossing the head and clamping, or swishing the tail.  Some gait abnormalities that can indicate pain include and irregular rhythm, hind limbs not following the front limbs, incorrect lead or gait changes, stumbling or toe dragging, spooking, reluctance to move, rearing and bucking.  All of these symptoms can occur due to many causes and not just pain but Dr. Dyson says if you see eight or more of these, musculoskeletal pain is likely and you should contact your veterinarian.

Category: Parasite Control in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It is possible that the deworming medication you are giving your horse may not be effective in killing parasites. At least that is the belief of Dr. Ray Kaplan at the University of Georgia. Dr. Kaplan indicates that the deworming programs many horse owners and farms use was developed back in the 60s. Studies back then revealed that deworming your horse every 8 weeks was the best method and this method worked really well during the 70s and 80s because new deworming drugs were invented that were very effective. However, now the parasites have changed and become much more resistant to the dewormers we have today. In fact, Dr. Kaplan indicates many horse owners are following recommendations from 30 to 40 years ago, many of the equine dewormers we are using today are totally ineffective and the ones that are effective are not keeping the number of parasites low for as long as they did in the past. In the 70s, the major parasite was the large strongyle that commonly caused colic. However, this parasite is well controlled at this point and the problem is the small strongyle. The problem with small strongyles is that very few dewormers are effective in killing the larval stages and the larvae cause the most problems. The larvae burrow into the wall of the intestine and then cause damage as they break out of the intestinal wall. Most dewormers kill only the adults and these larvae become adults after most of the damage has already been done. So the only method of decreasing intestine damage is to prevent pasture contamination by eggs so fewer larvae will develop. Join us next program when we will talk about methods to decrease pasture contamination.

Category: Pre-purchase Exam in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English For those considering buying a horse, I am going to talk about the importance of a pre-purchase exam. There is an old saying that there is no such thing as a free horse, meaning that even if someone gives you a horse, the upkeep still costs a considerable amount of money. So regardless of the amount of money you pay for a horse, a pre-purchase exam is always worth the money. An example is the pre-purchase we did on a horse for which our client was considering for his daughter to learn to ride. Although the horse was selling for only $500, the pre-purchase exam revealed the horse had caudal heel pain and possible navicular problems. If the client had purchased this horse, he would spend much more in corrective shoeing and treatment than he would if he would have paid more for a different horse. We have also performed pre-purchase exams on horses that had equine metabolic syndrome and had foundered. Although the horses were not lame at the time, founder is a permanent condition that will be a problem for the rest of the horse's life but without a pre-purchase, most buyers cannot tell the horse is affected. A pre-purchase exam can be simple or complex and depending on the cost of the horse, they do not have to be that expensive. If the horse is going to be used for high performance, then leg x-rays as well as other tests may be indicated. However, a regular physical and lameness exam by a vet is well worth the money before you purchase a horse. If you are considering purchasing a horse, check the horse out yourself and before you write the check call your vet for a professional non-biased opinion.

Category: Preventing and Controlling Mange in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Everyone has heard of mange in dogs but horses can also develop it too, although not as commonly as dogs. Mange basically means a disease caused by mites, but there are many different types of mites. The most severe type of mange in horses is sarcoptic mange due to the severe itching and scratching it causes. The mites cause intense scratching and rubbing on objects like fences or stall walls, and initial lesions usually occur on the head, neck and shoulders. Hair loss and crusts develop on the skin followed by severe skin damage and thickening of the skin. If untreated, the skin disease will spread over the entire body and can lead to decreased appetite and general weakness. The mites can usually be found by scraping some skin tissue and looking for the mites under the microscope. A similar type called psoroptic mange can also occur but horses usually develop lesions in the fetlock and mane, around the tail, between the hind legs or under the front legs, and even the ears. Treatment of both types is the same including topical insecticides, lime sulphur dip, or oral ivermectin. These mites are contagious to other horses and humans so take precaution to decrease spread of mites and treat all contact animals. Another type is chorioptic mange or leg mange, which affects the lower legs of draft horses or any horses with heavy feathers in the fetlock region. Secondary infection is common and in most cases, the hair will need to be clipped and topical insecticides applied to kill the mites as well as antibiotics to kill the infection. If your horse is itching or rubbing on objects or has a chronic skin condition, contact your veterinarian as mange is a possibility.

Category: Preventing Contagious Diseases in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Last program I talked about preventing contagious equine diseases from spreading at boarding stables and horse farms by quarantining all new horses for 3 weeks.  Of course it is also important to make sure all horses have a current Coggins test before being allowed to enter the premises.  Another concern is strangles.  Strangles is a serious upper respiratory tract disease that is caused by the bacteria strep equi and is highly contagious.  The difficulty with strangles is that some horses can be chronic carriers and shed the organism while not showing any clinical signs; a horse could enter a stable and appear completely normal and yet be contagious.  Because of this, it is recommended to test all new arrivals for strangles.  Strangles testing is sort of involved as it requires flushing fluid up into the nasal cavity and collecting it for culture and another test called a PCR.  If a horse is determined to be a shedder, it must be isolated until they are no longer shedding.  Carrier horses can maintain the organism in two pouches in the back of their throats called guttural pouches.  Treating these pouches with penicillin can kill the organism and prevent the horse from being contagious.  Although this is a lot of trouble, it should be considered when a new horse is entering an established herd to prevent strangles infection. Influenza is another contagious disease but is a virus and because the incubation period is very short, the 3-week quarantine period for new horses recommended on our last program will catch any influenza-infected horses to prevent exposure to the entire herd.  Join us on our next program when we will continue to discuss methods of preventing contagious equine diseases.

Category: Preventing Gastric Ulcers in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Stomach ulcers are common in humans but many of you may not realize they are also common in horses.  Most ulcers in horses are man made as they are  uncommon in wild horses and horses that graze on large amounts of acreage.  Scientific studies have indicated that 90% of racehorses are affected with stomach ulcers and this is not surprising considering their stress and training schedule.  However, even 60% of show horses are also affected, so all horses that are used in performance or showing are susceptible.  Ulcers are mostly man made and this is due to the fact that placing horses in stalls increases the chance of ulcers.  Also, feeding horses once or twice daily increases the chance of ulcers versus leaving the horses out on pasture to graze naturally.  Their stomachs produce acid 24 hours a day and if they don’t have food in the stomach by grazing continually, they are more likely to develop ulcers.  Stress is another cause of ulcers such as hauling to shows and training for events. A tip to help prevent stomach ulceration is to allow your horse free access to grass or hay at all times.  For horses that have to be stalled, be sure they are able to see other horses and have objects in the stall to keep them occupied such as a ball or other object.  There are many medications to decrease ulcers in horses but only a few have scientific proof of being effective.  A product called GastroGard is approved to treat and prevent ulcers in horses.  There are many other products advertised in horse magazines but most of these products have no scientific proof that they are effective.  Offering free access to feed and limiting stress are the most effective preventions.

Category: Previcox not for use in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about a regulation your veterinarian must abide by when administering medications for your animals. Many of the medications veterinarians use are labelled for only one species. Although veterinarians may use different drugs in unapproved species, there are specific regulations we must follow. Getting a drug approved for a particular species is expensive and getting approval for more than one species is even more expensive. It is important to realize that the actual cost of the chemical in the drug is only a small part of the cost because of all the testing required by the FDA. I am not saying this testing is not important, but it does increase the cost of the drug. In most cases, testing drugs for horses is more expensive than testing for dogs and cats due to the expense of keeping a herd of horses for testing. The reason I discuss this background specifically is to talk about a drug that is approved for both dogs and horses called firocoxib. The drug has different forms approved for horses and dogs. Firocoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used for pain and inflammation due to arthritis. The approved drug for dogs is called Previcox and the approved drug for horses is called Equioxx. Equioxx, the horse form, is much more expensive than the dog form and many people want to use the dog form for their horses. However, it is illegal to do so because of lack of testing and approval. It is permissible to use an approved human drug in an animal if it is less expensive, even if there is an animal drug available. However, you cannot use an approved animal drug from one species in another species just because it is less expensive.

Category: Quest (Moxidectin) as a Dewormer in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most of you with horses are familiar with various deworming products and today I am going to talk about a product containing moxidectin called Quest. This product was reviewed in Equine Veterinary Education by Drs. Schumacher and Taintor from Auburn University. Quest is in the same family of drugs as ivermectin but Quest is much more effective against the most serious parasite affecting horses at this time, the small strongyle. Small strongyles are unique in that horses ingest the larvae from the pasture and then become encysted in the horse's large intestine. This ability to encyst is important because encysted larvae are not killed by most of the regular dewormers used in horses, including those using ivermectin. This is one area where Quest has an advantage over some of the other products because it has been shown to kill encysted larvae. The only other product shown to kill encysted larvae is fenbendazole, which is sold under the trade name of Panacur. However, a regular dose of Panacur is ineffective and it takes a double dose of Panacur once daily for 5 days to kill these larvae. Also, Panacur is less effective against the other stages of the parasite than Quest. A concern about Quest is the possible side effects of the drug as numerous drug reactions have been reported. However, most of the problems occurred due to accidental overdose of the drug or incorrect estimation of the horse's weight. So Quest may be a product you need to consider adding to your deworming program but you should use a weight tape to carefully estimate your horse's weight before using Quest.

Category: Recovery of Jumping Horses after an Event
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many show horses have events every weekend, and this includes jumping horses. Because of this frequency, the veterinarians at the University of Messina in Italy were concerned that jumping horses may not be rested and recovered after just a few days of rest when they compete every weekend, so they designed a study to analyze the issue. The physical stress of athletic competition causes metabolic changes in muscle enzymes, and increased muscle enzymes indicate that muscle damage has occurred. Now, this is not abnormal for equine athletes but it is a good idea to allow the muscle to heal before causing more damage. In this study, the researchers investigated muscle enzyme levels in 12 jumping horses by taking blood samples before and after jumping competitions 2 weeks in a row. They found that metabolic changes indicate muscle fatigue. The metabolic changes were more significant after the second competition, suggesting the muscles suffer from excessive stress especially in the second weekend competition in a row. The authors indicate the short recovery period of only 5 days, from Sunday to Friday, could increase the possibility of muscle damage, and a longer recovery period is recommended to decrease the chance of damage. Now lots of folks might believe that training at home would produce just as much physical stress as a competition itself but according to the researchers that is incorrect. Although training may be longer, the intensity of training is less than in competition. This study was performed on jumping horses, and the authors state you cannot consider these results to be necessarily accurate for other performance horses.

Category: Red Blood Cell Count Can Judge Horse's Racing Ability
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Red blood cells in all mammals carry oxygen to the tissues by way of a protein called hemoglobin.  Hemoglobin binds and carries oxygen and is bound to a molecule of iron.  Anemia is a decrease in the number of red blood cells or a decrease in the percentage of red blood cells compared to plasma, called the hematocrit.  Since red blood cells carry oxygen, the more red blood cells a mammal has in the circulation that are carrying oxygen, the greater ability a horse will have to perform athletic endeavors such as jumping or barrel racing.  In fact, many people have tried for years to give horses blood builders to increase the number of red blood cells to give their horse an edge when racing.  Many owners and trainers of horses want their red blood count checked to determine if their horse has an optimum number of red blood cells so they can carry more oxygen to the tissue and therefore run faster and longer.  However, it is not that simple. The horse is unique among domestic animals in that they store up to one-third of their red blood cells in their spleen and they can release these cells with intense exercise.  So you could check the number of red blood cells or hematocrit of a resting horse, and then exercise the horse and after intense exercise the red blood cell count would be much higher.  The amount of increase will be related to the amount of exercise, so checking a resting horse’s red blood cell count is not necessarily going to indicate their ability to perform.  If the red blood cell count is significantly low, then the horse needs to be checked out further for anemia.  However, trying to judge a horse’s ability to perform athletic endeavors by looking at a resting red blood cell count is unlikely to be effective.

Category: Red or Orange Equine Urine in Snow
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you have horses and snow, you will sometimes be in for a shock as you walk out to check your horses and notice red or orange coloration in areas where the horse has urinated in the snow. This coloration is likely to be a surprise to people who are not used to being in snow. Needless to say, it can cause concern for horse owners.  Fortunately, in most cases this is not a disease process. The red spots you see are a result of your horse’s urine reacting with the cold snow.  Proteins in the urine called pyrocatechines oxidize in low temperatures, and this produces the red to orange colors noted in the snow.  So, if you see red or orange coloration in the area your horse urinated in the snow, do not be too concerned. However, there are some diseases that could cause real blood to be visible in the urine, so you want to make sure there isn’t any. The easiest method is to collect urine with a large clean cup duct tapped to a stick.  Although this is time consuming, it is necessary to rule out a problem. If the urine is normally yellow with no red or orange coloration, the horse is likely normal.  However, if the urine you catch is discolored, or if you see blood clots on the ground in the area the horse has urinated, call your vet. Horses can develop urinary tract infections that can cause bleeding, and they can also develop uroliths or stones in the bladder that can cause bleeding.  Additionally, they can also have a tear in their urethra or tumors in the bladder that would cause it. Some horses can bleed from the kidneys. So, it is likely normal if your horse urinates and you see red or orange in the snow.  However, catch some urine to be on the safe side and call your vet if it doesn’t look normal.

Category: Saddle Fit and the Tree Width’s Effect on Horse’s Thoracic Spines
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Saddle fit is an important part of a horse’s performance and health as an ill-fitting saddle can decrease performance and lead to injury.  Dr. Russell Mackechnie-Guire indicated in The Horse that there is a notion in the horse industry that fitting saddles too wide will allow the thoracolumbar region of the horse to increase its range of motion and improve muscular function.  However, there is no science to support this opinion.  The thoracolumbar, or t-l, area is from the withers to the pelvis where the saddle fits. A research team tested different saddle fits that were correct, narrow and wide on the movement of horses. The team fitted 13 sound horses with a validated sensor system and glued inertial measuring units along each horse’s poll, withers, middle of the back, lower back and hips.  All horses were ridden by two similar-sized right-handed female riders using a general-purpose Kent and masters English saddle because the tree width is adjustable.  The saddles were fitted correctly, narrow and wide by five master qualified saddle fitters and the differences in tree widths were 10% increase or decrease.  The horses were warmed up and cantered on both reins and were ridden on a calibrated track.  Results indicated horses wearing the wide saddle tree had significantly less flexion and extension of the middle of the back compared to the correct width tree.  Horses wearing the wide saddle tree had more axial rotation at the withers but less axial rotation at the middle of the back and at the lower back where axial rotation is rotation around the horse’s spine.  Also, the narrow tree saddle reduced lateral bending at the middle of the back so width of the tree does make a difference, and increasing the width may not be good for all horses.

Category: Saddle Fit Assessment
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Scott Anderson from Virginia had some interesting thoughts about saddle fitting at last year’s AAEP convention. A properly fitting saddle is key to keep any ridden horse healthy and performing at its best. The examination for saddle fit should initially begin with the horse standing squarely without a saddle pad, and then place the saddle on the horse’s back so the front flaps do not interfere with the horse’s shoulder blade when the horse is moving. This placement is usually one to two inches behind the scapula. Then check to see if the saddle is level, as the deepest part of the seat should be horizontal to the ground. If the saddle has an uphill appearance, the tree is likely too narrow; if downhill, likely too wide for your horse. Next check to see if the saddle rocks forward and back, as it should remain fairly stable. If the saddle rocks forward and back, the tree is too wide or the panels are too curved. Also, the pommel should not rest on top of the horse’s withers, and although the clearance may vary, there should be some clearance when the rider is in the saddle. However, the tree should contact the horse’s withers but it should be over a wide area with no focal points of pressure. You can slide your hand between the withers and the tree and if most of the contact is at the top, the saddle is too wide. There should also be consistent contact between the panel of the saddle and the horse’s back with no pressure points. And lastly, after being ridden in the saddle, there should be no back pain, swelling or rubbed areas of hair. The best option is to work with a professional saddle fitter or a veterinarian trained in saddle fitting, and remember that saddles change with time as can your horse’s back conformation, so regular exams to see if it still fits properly are important.

Category: Safe Horse Handling during Treatment or Sedation
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It's much safer when holding the horse to stand on the same side as the veterinarian so the horse can move away from both of you if necessary. Do not stand directly in front of a horse, as this is just as dangerous as standing directly behind one. Never trust a tranquilizer; although the horse may seem very sedate, these horses can still react to pain or other stimulus and injure you severely. People tend to relax around a sedated horse and let their guard down, assuming the horse will not move. However, I have seen horses so sedated they could barely stand and yet cause severe injury. So if your veterinarian is working on a sedated horse, stay alert. Never surprise horses without letting them know you are in the area, especially if they're sedated. You can do this by talking to the horse before touching him. In an emergency situation, stay as calm as possible. In these circumstances a horse is fearful and thus unpredictable, so it is important for the handler to remain calm. This is not easy, but your calmness can help keep your horse calm, and make treatment easier for everyone.

Category: Safely Handling a Recumbent Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It is understandably upsetting when your horse is recumbent (down) and cannot rise.If you have a horse that is down, properly handling and restraining the horse may prevent further injury to the horse or people trying to help. Regardless of the cause, these horses can be dangerous to themselves and humans, so handling techniques are good to know. Dr. Rebecca Husted, from Large Animal Emergency Rescue, spoke at the American Association of Equine Practitioners convention, saying that recumbent horses are difficult to safely restrain and are often in dangerous places when this occurs, such as horse trailers or small stalls. It is easy for the person or the horse to get injured. Because of the danger, it is a good idea to have protective equipment available such as helmets, boots, and gloves. If you have a down horse in a cramped space, call your veterinarian to sedate the horse to decrease the chance of injury. It can be difficult and dangerous to sedate these horses and sedation drugs may not be as effective due to the horse’s increased stress. Placing a pad or blanket over the horse’s head helps to prevent damage to the head and eyes, and hopefully decreases their fear. Avoid standing in dangerous areas such as directly in front of the horse, between the horse's legs, or behind the horse since the horse could still paw or kick while lying down causing injury. The goal is to try and get the horse sitting sternal so they can then stand up easier. Although previously it was common to put a knee on the horse’s neck and tip the nose up to keep the horse from trying to stand, this can be dangerous. It is recommended to put a halter on the horse and hold a lead rope while standing, placing your foot on the horse’s upper neck, and tipping the nose of the horse up with the halter. It can be stressful to manage a down horse, but with these tips, you can improve your safety and help your horse.

Category: Senior Horse Care
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Lots of senior horses need extra medical care. Dr. Earl Vaughn indicates they have decreased immunity compared to younger horses. Consequently, they cannot fight off disease as well so it is important to make sure they are vaccinated completely. It is also a good idea, if possible, to keep your older horses in a separate area from young horses that are being hauled to shows.  Older horses can also be more susceptible to parasites and many of the dewormers sold over the counter in the feed stores are no longer effective in Texas.  For this reason, it is important to have your veterinarian check the level of parasitism in your horses and deworm with effective medication rather than just going to the feed store and choosing a product. Nutrition is another key area for older horses as they usually have some dental issues, and many need senior feed as it is more digestible than regular feed.  Since a lot of these horses cannot chew hay well most senior feeds are complete diets, meaning you do not have to feed any roughage with them, although I prefer they be given hay or pasture.  Feeding good hay or pasture is helpful unless your horse has equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing’s disease, and about 30 percent of horses over the age of 15 have some degree of Cushing’s disease.  So when your vet comes out to check your older horse, make sure and ask about Cushing’s disease and possible testing for it. We can’t discuss older horses without talking about equine dentistry.  Horses need dental exams starting at birth and every 6 months thereafter.  Horses that do not get proper dental care will have major issues as they get older and likely will have a shorter lifespan due to the lack of dental care.

Category: Senior Horse Care Tips
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Because of advances in equine nutrition, management and veterinary care, horses are living longer than ever. We routinely see horses in their late twenties and even over 30 years old in our practice. However, all of these horses have good veterinary care, good nutrition, and good farrier care, all of which are critical for long-term health of the horse. And one of the most important things you can do for older horses is have your vet examine them twice a year. Although they do need certain vaccines, the exam your vet gives your horses is just as critical as the vaccine. If your vet is not performing a good exam on your horse when vaccines are given, ask them to do so because it is important for your horse's health. I am going to share some other tips in caring for the older horse published by the AAEP. Observe your horse on a regular basis and watch for changes in body condition, behavior and attitude. Feed a high-quality diet and avoid dusty or moldy feeds and always feed older horses separate from younger horses that might be more food aggressive and prevent the older horses from eating. Also, the more often you feed the better, as smaller meals fed frequently are much more normal for the horse and makes sure your horse is not overweight. You should be able to feel the ribs easily but not see them. Also, adequate appropriate exercise is beneficial to maintain muscle tone as long as the horse has no medical problems preventing exercise. Grooming is also important so you can check your horse's skin for infections and tumors. Tumors are not uncommon in older horses and any new growths should be examined by your veterinarian.

Category: Shock Wave Treatment for Arthritic Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses commonly develop wounds on the lower legs and although some heal without a problem, many are difficult to heal due to lack of blood supply and the occurrence of proud flesh. All open wounds that are not sutured heal by filling in with granulation tissue; if granulation tissue becomes excessive and grows too far out of the wound, it is called proud flesh. Wounds cannot heal with proud flesh because the skin cannot cover the wound. One treatment that has been used in certain orthopedic conditions is extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and this treatment method was also used in a study on healing of lower leg wounds. Shock wave therapy is pulsed high energy waves that cause the release of energy in the tissues that theoretically could decrease healing time. There are many treatments used to decrease healing time in lower leg wounds but very few of them have been actually tested in controlled studies. In this study with shock wave, wounds were created on all four limbs of six horses and some of the wounds were treated with shock wave once weekly for four weeks and lightly bandaged, while others were only lightly bandaged. Results indicated that control wounds were almost twice as inflamed as wounds treated with shock wave. Also, control wounds had a significantly greater amount of proud flesh than wounds treated with shock wave. However, the size of the wound areas was not significantly different between control wounds and those treated with shock wave therapy. So even though shock wave decreased inflammation and proud flesh, it did not decrease healing time. If you have a wound on a horse's leg, use of shock wave to decrease healing time is questionable.

Category: Side Effects of Bute in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most commonly used medications in horses is the drug phenylbutazone (referred to as bute), which is used to treat pain and inflammation in a variety of conditions.  In fact, many horse owners want to keep bute on hand to use when they feel that a horse is hurting.  However, this is a prescription drug and should only be used after a veterinarian has diagnosed a condition and dispensed the drug.  This drug is so common that horse owners believe it is safe enough that it can be used like a person taking aspirin; however, although bute is the same class of drug as aspirin, it can have serious side effects if not used correctly and sometimes even if it is used correctly. The most serious side effect of bute is a condition called right dorsal colitis.  This condition is one in which the colon on the horse’s upper right side becomes inflamed. It occurs because drugs like bute and even banamine not only have good effects like reducing inflammation but bad effects like inhibiting chemicals that protect the lining of the GI tract.  By blocking these protectors, the colon can become inflamed and this can be so severe it can be deadly.  Horses with the condition lose large amounts of protein in the GI tract and it can lead to absorption of poisons into the horse’s body.  Unfortunately, it is not just large doses of the drug that can cause the problem as even recommended doses can be dangerous.  There are some predisposing factors in which bute or banamine should not be used at all or only used carefully.  Never use bute in a dehydrated horse and only use the lowest dose possible as a dose above the recommended dose does not actually increase the pain-killing ability but increases the chance of side effects.

Category: Single Bell Boot Can Increase Strength in a Horse’s Leg
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English  It is not abnormal for a horse to have some asymmetry in one leg due to one leg being weaker than another.  Dr. Adrian Harrison from Denmark indicated in "The Horse"magazine that placing something loose around the fetlock of the weak leg causes the horse to feel something on the leg and will engage that leg, strengthening it more. He said whatever is applied to the leg does not have to be heavy but can be as simple as a bell boot. By strapping the boot loosely on the weaker leg during normal training, riders can help their horses build muscle in that leg. This technique is helpful for a leg that may have been injured or has an opposite dominant leg. Dr. Harrison indicates this really helps horses that have previously injured a leg and need to get it back into shape. The concept is proprioception, which is an individual’s awareness of their body parts. The bell boot allows the horse to remember that specific leg and use it more. The Danish team was able to use biotechnology to confirm that proprioception is working to increase muscle activity.  In the study, eight amateur dressage horses were sound but had slightly weak left hind limbs as measured when circling to the left. Bell boots were used for 60 minutes every three days in the left hind leg for six weeks during normal workouts. After six weeks, the legs were tested, and the right and left legs were found to have the same amount of strength. Most horses have one leg they prefer to use more than the others, and although this may not cause a lameness, it could affect performance, and many times experienced riders can feel the difference. If there is an imbalance, it could lead to more serious problems if not checked.

Category: Stall Bedding Affects Horse Behavior
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English An interesting study was recently published in the Journal of Equine Veterinary Science concerning the behavior of horses as it relates to the bedding materials used in the stalls. A recent report out of Germany indicates most riding horses in that country are housed in single stalls and are in these stalls sometimes all but 1 hour per day. Consequently, the stall environment has a lot to do with their behavior. Stall bedding is used to absorb excrement, protect from mechanical insult, cushion the horse's legs against concussion and improve traction. Horses favor lying down in areas with bedding as compared to areas without it, and a dry and soft floor seems to have a positive effect on horse welfare. Bedding material also has a positive effect on noxious gases, dusts, and air quality in the stable and inadequate bedding can lead to hoof problems such as thrush. To determine the effect of stall bedding on horse behavior, this study out of Germany used dust-free wood shavings, wheat straw, and wheat straw pellets. Each material was used for 2 weeks and results indicated that the horses spent more time lying down when the stall was bedded with wheat straw than shavings or straw pellets. Horses in the wild are occupied with finding food 60% of the time and horses in stalls do not have anything to occupy their time. Providing horses with bedding that helps to occupy them can decrease the chance of abnormal behaviors that sometimes develop in stalled horses and wheat straw was the best at occupying horses at least in this study. One concern with straw bedding is you need to make sure horses will not eat the straw as this could cause colic.

Category: Stallion Behavior Drugs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A common request of horse owners and breeders is for veterinary assistance in using a drug or drugs to modify the behavior of stallions and geldings at shows, and for stallions during the breeding season. Although there are some drugs that may be beneficial, the most important part of horse behavior is training and handling, not the use of drugs. Drugs may be used to help with training or when training has been ineffective. The most commonly used drug to affect behavior in male horses is progesterone. It has been used to quiet aggression and sexual behavior in training and performance situations. Oral altrenogest is the most available form of the drug and is called Regumate, is approved for use in mares, and it has been used at the normal or double dose once daily to reduce aggressive and sexual behavior. It also reduces testicular size and sperm production, which is a concern during breeding season, especially if a specific stud has lowered fertility. Equine behavior specialist Dr. Sue McDonnell indicates that the changes in behavior have been modest in semen collection protocols. Also, sexual and aggressive behaviors were not significantly suppressed or eliminated, so at this time a treatment regimen with Regumate has not been developed to quiet behavior without affecting semen quality. It is believed the semen effects are temporary but it is not certain how long the effects last before full sperm output is achieved. So if you are breeding a stallion, giving progesterone is probably not a good option.

Category: Stallion Handling
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today I am going to give you some tips on handling a breeding stallion as recommended by Dr. Dickson Varner at Texas A&M. Handling a stallion can sometimes be a real challenge and someone without experience can not only endanger themselves but can also cause major long-term breeding problems for the stallion. Although each stallion is an individual, there are some general recommendations that can be helpful and some of these may be applicable to all horses. It is important to watch the stallion in the paddock to determine if he is timid, frightened, anxious, or aggressive. Does he strike or bite at the handler or try to kick, and what kinds of handling has he been exposed to in the past? Next, Dr. Varner indicates you should never completely trust any stallion. Many people have been seriously injured by apparently well-behaved stallions. This does not mean you should use excessive force, it just means to be alert at all times. Dr. Varner recommends using a leather halter with a 30-inch chain attached to a leather lead. The halter needs to have round metal stays, should fit correctly, and should not be too loose or too tight. Rope halters like those sold for natural horsemanship training are not recommended for stallions unless they are very gentle. The chain on the lead works very well; it can just be used as a lead only, or if necessary it can be attached on the right side of the halter and passed either over the nose, under the chin, or through the mouth over to the left side if more control of the stallion is needed. Dr. Varner prefers the chain rather than chifney or bar bits for these stallions. Join us next time when we will discuss some training methods to prepare stallions for breeding.

Category: Strangles Vaccination for your Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Strangles is not an uncommon disease in horses, is very contagious, and can cause lots of problems when it occurs.  Strangles causes an upper respiratory infection in which abscesses can be found in the lymph nodes under the jaw and in the throat area. However, some horses can develop internal abscesses that can be difficult to treat.  Since the disease is quite contagious, infected horses must be quarantined until they are proven clear of infection. In many states, strangles requires veterinarians to report the case to animal health authorities, although that is not the case in Texas at this time.  Some horses can remain carriers of the disease for months and even years and not show clinical symptoms, but can transmit the organism to susceptible horses. Usually it’s a disease of younger horses. One method of trying to prevent the disease is vaccinating with a bacteria infused in the nasal cavity, not with a needle but with a pipette.  However, lots of horses do not like this material infused in their nose, so some vets give the vaccine in the mouth even though until now this method has not been studied.  Some vets also believe the vaccine may work better given orally rather than intranasally. Recently, some researchers at Kansas State tested the effectiveness of the vaccine by giving it to some horses orally and some in the nose.  Results indicated both routes of entry were effective at stimulating immunity against the disease.  However, the magnitude of the response was greater giving the vaccine in the nose as it was intended.  The vaccine can cause reactions if the horse has a high level of immunity against the bacteria when it is given, so ask your vet about their opinion on vaccinating your horse for strangles.

Category: Sunburn and Photosensitization in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses can get two skin diseases related to ultraviolet light exposure. One is sunburn and the other, called photosensitization, looks like sunburn but is more serious. Sunburn can occur in horses and is usually seen on the muzzle and around the eyes in horses with white coats and thin hair. Photosensitization is related to eating a plant that causes photosensitization, from eating plants that affect the liver, or from other causes of liver dysfunction. Sunburn can be treated by applying zinc oxide to the affected areas or by using a fly mask that will shade some of the area. However, if you have a horse that has peeling skin on the white areas of the coat in places other than the head, it is likely the horse has photosensitization. Photosensitization occurs when the horse eats a plant containing a photodynamic agent or the horse already has liver damage. If a horse eats a plant containing the photodynamic agent, the agent enters the blood stream and reacts to ultraviolet light from the sun as the blood courses through superficial blood vessels on horses with white coats. The second type is when the horse eats a plant that causes liver damage or the horse has liver damage from another source. Plants contain chlorophyll and a metabolite of chlorophyll is a compound called phylloerythrin that builds up with liver disease and reacts with ultraviolet light on white skin. So if you have a horse with a white coat and the skin is inflamed, it could just be sunburn but could also be more involved; it could also indicate your horse may have a liver problem.

Category: Teixobactin Antibiotic Helps with Resistant Organisms
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There is some interesting new research concerning bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. Bacterial resistance is becoming a major issue in human and animal health; I am sure everyone has heard of MRSA or methicillin resistant staph aureus, which is a staph organism that is resistant to most antibiotics. We are seeing more and more of these resistant cases in veterinary medicine, although they were really unheard of, at least in veterinary medicine, just ten short years ago. Lots of research is ongoing to find the cause of the resistance and a large study is being conducted by Colorado State to determine the effect of animal agriculture on resistant bacteria. Many studies are also being conducted to find new antibiotics and the January 2015 issue of the journalNatureindicates that scientists have discovered a new class of antibiotics called teixobactin.  This antibiotic kills a wide range of bacteria including MRSA.  Most existing antibiotics are derived from natural sources such as fungi, and scientists culture the microorganisms in the lab to produce the antibiotic. However, the scientists indicate that 99% of the organisms that could produce antibiotics cannot be grown in a lab, so there is significant potential for new antibiotics. These scientists developed several methods to grow organisms by using specific growth factors and this is how they discovered teixobactin. Dr. Kim Lewis at Northeastern University in Boston indicates clinical trials should begin in about two years and will take three years to complete, so it will be at least five years before these new antibiotics would be available. However, at least there is some hope for treating resistant bacteria.

Category: Tetanus Antitoxin Compared to Tetanus Toxoid Use in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It is common knowledge in the horse business that horses are susceptible to tetanus. For this reason, it is recommended all horses get vaccinated for tetanus every year. However, many folks do not realize there are two different types of tetanus shots. The yearly tetanus vaccine is a tetanus toxoid and is effective at preventing the disease. However, this vaccine is a toxoid and so it is not effective until 2 weeks after the vaccine is given. So what do you do if in the interim your horse steps on a nail or develops a laceration and is not vaccinated? Well, there is another product called a tetanus antitoxin and this antitoxin starts working immediately but only lasts about 10 days. However, there are some problems with tetanus antitoxin; it has been reported, although rarely, to cause a serious disease called serum sickness. Many years ago it was recommended that all newborn foals receive tetanus antitoxin immediately after birth. However, because of this potential problem, the use of tetanus antitoxin in newborn foals is not recommended and it is recommended to vaccinate the mare 6 weeks before foaling with the tetanus toxoid, which protects the foal. The second concern about tetanus antitoxin is from new research in Belgium showing that tetanus antitoxin is not 100% effective in preventing the disease. The researchers examined all the tetanus cases over several years at their hospital and found many of them received tetanus antitoxin and yet still developed the disease; tetanus is deadly in the majority of cases. So, make sure your horse is vaccinated every year for tetanus and do not wait until an injury occurs.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Rectal palpation is a common diagnostic technique used by veterinarians for many different conditions in horses, including diagnosing the cause of a colic.  The most common use of rectal palpation is to check brood mares to determine the correct time to breed, if the mare is pregnant, and to monitor the pregnancy.  Rectal palpation in brood mares is required to be performed two or three or more times before breeding in some mares, and also after breeding in some that have difficulty becoming pregnant.  So you can see this is a common procedure performed by veterinarians daily, and because it is so common, many owners forget that there is a risk of possibly tearing the rectum. Rectal tears are very serious and can even be deadly in cases of a complete tear.  There are stages from minor tears that just involve the mucosa only all the way to a complete tear that exposes the abdominal cavity to feces.  Minor tears can usually be treated with just laxatives while tears through the rectum that contaminate the abdomen with feces are usually deadly.  The important thing to realize is that although the condition is common, there is potential risk and your veterinarian is not the cause of these tears in most cases.  Sometimes they just happen and if so, referral to a boarded equine specialist is recommended.  Rectal tears usually occur in brood mares because they undergo the procedure so often, which leads to irritation of the rectal lining.  If your vet believes a rectal tear has occurred, it’s critical to pack the rectum with a cotton-filled rectal sleeve and get to a specialist. It is important to realize that rectal palpation in horses is necessary, but the procedure does have some risk associated with it.

Category: The Veterinarian and Farrier Relationship
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horse owners need both a veterinarian and a farrier and it is critical for your horse that these individuals get along with each other and can work together to benefit your horse.  After all, helping your horse should be the goal for both of them.  However, it is sometimes difficult to get the farrier and veterinarian to agree on treatment and this can lead to problems.  Most veterinarians do not shoe horses and only trim them when there is an immediate issue and so a veterinarian needs a good farrier to do the trimming and shoeing.  The farrier also needs the veterinarian because most farriers have not been trained in radiology.  Ideally, the vet and farrier both look at the horse and the x-rays and come up with a treatment plan. Many times farriers and veterinarian have different opinions on how best to treat the horse and this leads to confusion and lack of communication.  A lot of it has to do with egos of the individuals believing they know what’s best.  Sometimes the farrier may be correct and sometimes the veterinarian may be correct but regardless, if there is a difference of opinion, it is going to be difficult to treat the horse.  If one person is treating the horse for a certain condition in a certain manner and the other person does not agree, the horse suffers.  I am fortunate because I have a really good farrier and we have learned from each other, but everyone is not so lucky.  Choose a veterinarian and a farrier that can work together.  Ask your veterinarian if they are willing to work with your farrier and ask the same of your farrier.  If not, find a veterinarian or farrier that are comfortable working together for the betterment of your horse.

Category: Too Hot to Ride Your Horse?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English It’s summer and the temperatures are over 100 degrees in many parts of the country. These temperatures can have an effect on horses as well as humans.  It is important to know when horses are at risk for heat stress and today we are going to talk about some information on heat stress published by the Kentucky Equine Research staff. The most common method of predicting heat stress is to take the outside air temperature and add that number to the percent humidity. If the sum of these numbers is less than 130, the chance of heat stress is unlikely.  If the sum is over 150, the horse’s ability to lose body heat is severely decreased, especially if humidity is greater than 50% of the total.  If the sum of the temperature and humidity is greater than 170, the horse can lose little body heat and should probably not be worked in this environment. Horses lose body heat through sweat, exhaling warm air, and widening blood vessels in the skin.  When the air temperature is near body temperature, heat loss is greatly decreased.  About 30% of increased body heat is lost in sweat as horses working in hot humid conditions can lose over 7 gallons of fluid as sweat, in addition to electrolytes important for body function.  Loosing 7 gallons an hour will certainly cause dehydration so horses working in this heat must drink plenty of water and should be given electrolytes.  It is important to monitor your horse’s temperature. A horse’s normal temperature can get to 103 degrees Fahrenheit with exercise but if it gets over 105F, you should be concerned. So if the air temperature and humidity added together are more than 150, it may be too hot for your horse to go riding.

Category: Transitioning Your Horse from Shod to Barefoot
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English According to Dr. Chris White in the publication The Horse, many horse owners in the northern United States remove their horse’s shoes for the winter to keep snow from packing onto the steel shoes. Even if you live where there’s not much snow, you may still want to remove your horse’s shoes at some point, and it is important to have a plan. Transitioning your horse from wearing shoes to going barefoot requires a bit of planning, and it is better for your horse if done gradually. In addition to ice and snow packing, allowing your horse to be barefoot for a period of time will help with contracted heels and allow your horse to grow a healthier frog, especially if your horse has a problem with thrush. Regularly trimming your horse’s hooves is always important, but any trimming after your horse’s shoes are freshly removed should be minimal, as the protection that was provided by the shoe is now gone. Removing the shoes and then possibly too much of the sole can lead to lameness due to bruising. Farrier Alicia Harlov, a hoof care provider on the North Shore of Massachusetts and a member of Progressive Hoofcare Practitioners, and the author of the Humble Hoof says if she is going to remove shoes, she starts with the hind feet as she feels this is an easier transition. Some horses are uncomfortable when removing all four shoes at the same time and keeping the front shoes on for a while gives them time to adjust to being barefoot. Alicia also says that a well-balanced diet is important for hoof health. Addressing any conditions like laminitis secondary to Cushing’s disease, or equine metabolic syndrome, is critical for success. Alicia makes a point that barefoot is not for every horse. Some horses have genetically thin soles and will never do well barefoot, while others do very well without shoes.

Category: Transporting Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses transported in trailers can certainly experience a range of environmental temperatures and relative humidity, and exposure to different allergens and different contaminants.  Horses being moved must adapt to different management strategies, possibly exposure to new horses and unfamiliar spaces, unfamiliar movements beneath their feet, and different water and feeding patterns.  So if you haul horses, all of these parameters must be considered. One thing you can do is drive slower, take turns slower, and avoid stopping or starting quickly as all of these movements increase stress on the horse’s legs.  Although some people prefer to tie horses when hauling, it has been shown horses are less stressed when not tied.  When tied, the horse cannot always adopt the safest and most comfortable posture while the vehicle is in motion.  Also, tying the horse’s head prevents normal drainage of the respiratory tract and has been shown to predispose horses to pneumonia, so if you do tie horse’s heads, you should not haul them for over one hour without untying them to allow then to put their heads down for drainage purposes. Hauling can also be difficult on horses due to disruption of their eating, drinking, and resting schedule. Even if you stop for breaks, many horses will not drink enough water to maintain hydration, which decreases gut function and can lead to colic.  Also, horses cannot eat on schedule when being hauled in many cases, and this can lead to colic. Hauling horses can be stressful on everyone if the horse is not properly trained to load and unload. Many horses are injured during loading accidents and part of this is because traditional loading training involves negative reinforcement.  The veterinarians at the Royal Veterinary College in Britain indicate that the most important aspect of a pressure-based training system is not the application of pressure but the release of pressure.  Also, the use of positive rewards for positive responses may increase the speed of response. It is important to train the horse to stand still at every point on the wrap when loading and unloading, which will help prevent less rushing to get on or off the trailer and subsequent accidents.  All horses should be trained to load and unload when they are as young as possible. Reducing the height of the step up by using a ramp will help, as does making the ramp feel as solid as possible. Transporting a horse interrupts a horse’s regular drinking, eating, urinating and resting.  Also, trailoring requires significant energy expenditure to continually maintain their posture in a moving trailer and because of this, it is important that a rest period be allowed after transport. Another concern is hauling horses immediately after competition as they are already tired and without adequate rest, the trip can be stressful and fatiguing for the horse.  As traveling is a stress, always make sure your horses are currently vaccinated at least 2 weeks before transporting. In order to remain upright, horses make postural adjustments that allow them to compensate for the changing motion of the vehicle.  Horses adopt a bracing posture while the vehicle is moving in which the hind legs and forelegs are wide apart.  The forelimbs are advanced forward and the head and neck are raised, placing more weight on the hind quarters.  If horses are packed too tightly in the trailer and do not have enough room to adopt this posture, they can lose their balance and injuries can occur.  It is important to realize that to maintain this posture, horses must expend a considerable amount of energy when riding in a trailer so it is not like they are just standing back there riding along all relaxed.  We know the horse is working to stand steady because of the increased heart rate noted in horses when the trailer is moving. Another study looked at position in the trailer. Horses facing the rear of the trailer expended lower energy and heart rates compared to horses facing forward or facing sideways to the direction of travel.  Also, horses facing toward the rear showed fewer losses of balance, carried their heads and necks lower and showed a less rigid posture. Because of this, you may want to consider hauling your horses backward and see if they have more energy for competition after the ride versus hauling them forward or angled forward.  Also, if you have to haul a horse with an injured leg, the injured leg should be toward the rear of the trailer to protect it from the effects of stopping the vehicle.

Category: USEF Vaccination Rules for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English As of December, 2015, new vaccination rules were effective for horses showing in United States Equestrian Federation events. All horses showing in USEF events must be currently vaccinated for equine influenza virus and equine herpes virus. A current vaccination means the vaccine must have been given within the last six months. Both of these diseases are highly contagious and both cause respiratory symptoms, although equine herpes virus 1 can also cause abortion and neurological disease. There are herpes virus vaccines approved to protect against the abortion form of the disease but none are licensed to protect against the neurological form. Regardless, the USEF's goal is to prevent these respiratory infections from going through a show barn and infecting all the horses. The rule states that horses not in compliance may be required to leave the show grounds. Documentation to prove your horse is vaccinated will require a veterinarian's record with the date the vaccine was given and the name of the vaccine. Also, if a person other than a veterinarian gives the vaccines, the owner must provide a receipt of the vaccine purchased that is signed by the owner or agent, name, serial number and expiration date of the vaccine and date the vaccine was given. If there is a medical reason the horse cannot be vaccinated, a letter from the veterinarian must accompany the horse and a log of temperatures taken twice daily for a week and twice daily at the show grounds must be provided. Since most show horses are routinely vaccinated for these diseases anyway, complying with this rule should not be a problem for most horse owners.

Category: Using Platelet Rich Fibrin to Help Healing Equine Wounds
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Lacerations commonly occur in horses and some of them can be difficult to heal.  Equine wounds, especially on the lower legs, are very susceptible to proud flesh. That prevents the wounds from healing and if not treated correctly, large amounts of scar tissue can develop.  These wounds can be painful with chronic infections and can be a source of lameness. Many of these wounds on the lower legs cannot be sutured, or the sutures will not hold, and this leaves an open wound with a large amount of area for the skin to cover.  Some of these can take months to heal with daily wrapping and surgery to remove proud flesh. Platelet rich plasma has been used to aid in wound healing as it contains growth factors to encourage healing with little scar formation.  However, platelet rich plasma is a liquid, which makes it difficult to keep in contact with the wound surface.  To solve this issue, Dr. Corey Orava developed a product called platelet rich fibrin. It is a solid material.  The platelet fibrin is formed using the horse’s own red blood cells. The cells are removed, leaving a fibrin clot that is a solid piece of material. It can be flattened and applied to the wound, and even sutured to the wound surface.  There is no risk of rejection as the product is formed from the horse’s own blood and in many cases will incorporate into the wound and will be fully resorbed.  Platelets are naturally activated by exposure to damaged tissue and they release granular contents into a wound environment, which includes anabolic growth factors that are responsible for initiation, propagation, and maintenance in all phases of wound healing. Platelet rich fibrin may be helpful for healing equine lower leg wounds, so talk to your equine veterinarian about it.

Category: Using Prednisolone in Horses with Laminitis and Founder
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Many horses have flying insect allergies and other allergies as well as respiratory disease, such as equine asthma, that require steroids like prednisolone to control their symptoms.  However, many of these horses also have laminitis or founder or may be overweight, have equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing’s disease, making them susceptible to laminitis and founder. In these horses, steroids have been reported to increase the chance of laminitis and founder developing, and yet allergic conditions in many cases require their use. To determine the safety of using oral prednisolone in these horses, a British study was done over a 13-year period; 416 horses that received prednisolone were compared to 814 control horses that hadn’t.  The median age of the horses was 13 and no significant differences between breeds and sexes were noted.  The laminitis rate was calculated and there was no significant difference between prednisolone-treated and non-treated groups in overall incidence of laminitis.  There were 62 total cases of laminitis with an incidence of 3.5% of the horses not treated with prednisolone and 2.5% of those treated with prednisolone, but about 50% of the horses treated with prednisolone developed laminitis while on the drug.  Also, 50% of the horses that developed laminitis on the drug also have equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing’s disease.  So, it appears from the study that prednisolone did not increase the risk of laminitis.  However, I believe one should still be cautious using it in horses with equine metabolic syndrome or Cushing’s disease unless absolutely necessary and then understand there may be a risk with its use.

Category: Vaccinating Foals at the Appropriate Time
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Foals are born around April and in a few months, they will need to be vaccinated. The question is when to begin. A lot of this depends on the vaccination status of the mare as historically, foals born to vaccinated mares are not vaccinated the same way as young as foals born to unvaccinated mares. Foals born to unvaccinated mares should have it early, beginning at three months of age, as they have no immunity to prevent disease. Foals born to vaccinated mares will have immunity transferred from the mare to the foal at birth through the colostrum, assuming the foal received adequate colostrum. Because of this, foals born to vaccinated mares are routinely vaccinated later because they are assumed to be protected, and it is believed the antibodies from the mare would cancel out any vaccinations given to the foal starting at three months of age. However, there was a lack of scientific evidence to support this theory and the veterinarians at Kansas State performed a study in which they vaccinated foals with three doses of vaccine beginning at three months of age in one group, and at six months in another group. Foals were vaccinated for encephalomyelitis, tetanus, West Nile, and equine herpes virus. Both groups were again vaccinated at 11 months of age. Results indicated that all foals, regardless of when vaccinations were begun, responded to the vaccines and even foals vaccinated at three months of age are capable of immune activation despite antibodies received from the mare. So if you have foals in a critical situation and need early protection against these diseases, you can begin vaccinating foals at three months of age; if three doses are given followed by a booster at 11 months of age, it is likely the foals will respond to the vaccine.

Category: Vaccinations for Your Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If you didn’t vaccinate your horse this spring or summer, you still can. All adult horses are recommended to have the core vaccines every year. Core vaccines are encephalitis and West Nile virus, rabies, and tetanus. These diseases can affect an individual horse and are not developed by being around other horses. Even if your horse is alone on 1000 acres, these vaccines need to be given every year. Encephalitis and West Nile are viral infections transmitted by mosquitoes. Every horse is susceptible to these illnesses as exposure to another horse is not needed to get them. Rabies is passed to horses from wild animals. Tetanus can be caused by your horse stepping on a nail or other sharp object and horses are very susceptible to tetanus. If you haul your horse anywhere or board at a facility with other horses that come and go, your horse should receive herpes virus vaccine, influenza vaccine, and strangles vaccine. These illnesses are not only spread by horse-to-horse contact but can be spread by objects that are used on more than one horse, like a twitch or a brush. Your horse’s friend who lives across the fence might have been exposed to outside horses. This is another situation in which respiratory vaccines would be recommended. Dr. Elizabeth Davis DVM, Ph.D., Dipl. ACVIM, Kansas State University, says in the publication The Horse that although possible, there is no evidence that overvaccination occurs in horses. By vaccinating, you are helping to protect your horse from diseases, some of which are deadly. Never vaccinate a sick horse. Ask your veterinarian if your horse is safe to vaccinate if you’re not sure.

Category: Vaccine Effectiveness can be Reduced by NSAIDs in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Although adverse reactions by horses to routine vaccinations are rare, they do occur. In most cases, vaccine reactions in horses are usually limited to swelling at the injection site and some short-term soreness. Because of those possibilities, some people will administer a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) at the same time as the vaccine the most common NSAIDs used in horses are bute and banamine. Many times horses are vaccinated during the show or performance season, and trainers do not want them to be sore and unable to perform so an anti-inflammatory is used. However, the veterinarians at Michigan State were concerned that the use of NSAIDs might have an effect on the horse's response to the vaccine, so they designed a study to determine if there was an effect. The study involved three groups of horses in which one group received an influenza vaccine and an NSAID, one group received an influenza vaccine but no NSAID, and the last group received neither. Blood samples were checked for antibody response and results indicated the horses vaccinated and given an NSAID had a decreased response to the vaccine compared to vaccinated horses that did not receive the anti-inflammatory. Even though the response to vaccine was less, it is not known if the response was decreased enough to prevent protection. Also, only flu vaccine was used in this study, and there is no evidence the same effect occurs with other vaccines. However, it is probably not a good idea to give bute or banamine to a horse at the same time as vaccines are given due to a possible decreased response to the vaccine.

Category: Veterinary Skills for Horse Owners
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horse owners should be competent in some minor veterinary skills horse, according to Equus magazine.  Taking your horse’s temperature is certainly something you need to know how to do, you can use a regular human electronic rectal thermometer available at any pharmacy. Your veterinarian can show you where to stand so the procedure can be performed safely.  The second skill is monitoring your horse’s heart rate or taking the pulse. You can do this by purchasing a stethoscope or your veterinarian can teach you to take the pulse by feeling an artery just under the horse’s jaw, about half way from the throat to the front teeth.  Getting a respiratory rate is also important and you can do this just by watching your horse breathe and counting the number of breaths per minute. Checking the mucous membranes is important and this includes checking the color of the gums, which should be pink and moist.  Checking the capillary refill time is also important as it gives the vet an idea of perfusion of the organs.  It can be determined by lifting your horse’s lip, pressing your finger on the gum and counting the number of seconds it takes for the white area that you touched to turn pink again; normal is less than two and a half seconds.  The last skill to perform is placing medication in your horse’s eye. A photograph in the article shows a person with ointment on their finger placing it in a horse’s eye.  I do not believe this is a good idea unless you are wearing a new latex glove for each treatment because you can transfer bacteria and fungi into the eye and cause a major infection.  Horses’ eyes are quite sensitive and it is critical to have your vet show you how to apply ointment or drops as neither is an easy procedure.

Category: Warming up Your Horse to Prevent Injuries
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Warming up your horse is critical to achieving optimal athletic performance as it initiates physiological changes and reduces the risk of soft tissue injury, according to Dr. Erica Mckenzie from Oregon State in The Practitioner. Although warm up for different events will not be the same, there are some general guidelines to follow.  Warm up activity should be done before all directed work in training and in competition and should be built into to the daily exercise regimen to enhance compliance.  It must be convenient, practical and designed to prepare the relevant muscles and tendons for the impending exercise. As warm up increases body temperature, the muscle, tendon and ligament flexibility are increased; so are muscle fiber, nerve conduction velocity and muscle relaxation rate, which aids in coordination.  Increased body temperature with exercise also promotes more rapid release of oxygen molecules and therefore the horses will have increased energy while delaying fatigue. There are also some non-temperature related effects, including increased blood flow and oxygen supply to the muscles, due to increased heart and respiratory rates, splenic contraction and increased muscle power.  Greater force is required to injure a warmer muscle due to greater pliability of the muscle and greater range of motion.  Active warmup includes gentle exercise stress that increases in intensity. Evidence suggests that active warm up can reduce total heat accumulation during intense exercise. which is important in hot climates. The period of warm up will vary. Ten minutes should be the minimum and may be enough in warm weather.  However, in cold weather, warm up may require 40 minutes.  In a high-level jumping competition in which warm up times were assessed, the average time was about 20 minutes.  The warm up should be divided into specific phases such as flat work and jumping phases or slow work and fast work phases, depending on the event. Ideally, the warm up should consist of some portion of the activity similar to the competition so if it is a jumping event, warm up should include some low jumps increasing to higher jumps to prepare the horse’s backs and limbs.  Horses expected to perform hard work in training or competition should have some degree of hard work at the end of the warm up, prior to competition, as this has been shown to influence subsequent oxygen delivery to the tissues being exercised immediately after warm up.  Now, these high intensity exercises should be very short in duration so you do not deplete energy and reduce power prior to the competition.  And if you are in a competition that has breaks in the performance, rewarm up is recommended before every event, which could be continuous low-grade activity or a period of rest and then rewarming up with your same initial warm up routine.  Rewarm up may not require as much time as the initial warm up, but this depends on the time between events and how hot or cold it is.

Category: Water Quality Testing for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We all know that a source of good clean water is a requirement for animals, and that several different sources of water are common on horse farms and cattle ranches. Certainly some of these water sources are better than others when you consider farm ponds, streams, lakes, well water, and rural or city water systems. Dr. Steve Higgins indicates in Equine Disease Quarterly that it is difficult to find guidelines specific for equine drinking water because most of the guidelines are listed for all livestock. Water samples can be tested for physical properties, excessive nutrients, toxic compounds, and microbes. Water samples can also be tested for water hardness, salinity, and pH. Salinity is the presence of dissolved substances and hardness relates to the concentration of calcium and magnesium in the water. Excessive hardness can create mineral deposits on water pipes and affect the ability to disinfect these areas. Sulfates and nitrates can also be detected as well as arsenic, fluorine, lead, and mercury. Recently, a case of water sulfate toxicity was reported in Canada that resulted in the deaths of five horses and 13 horses with severe diarrhea out of a herd of 19. Fecal coliform analysis can help determine the presence of fecal matter and possible pathogens. Stagnant water during periods of a drought can cause excessive growth of blue green algae, and cattle have been reported to become sick or die from drinking water with high levels of blue green algae. Floods can also affect water sources as contamination with sewage and petrochemicals is common. If you are concerned about the water source for your livestock, contact the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Category: Weight that your Horse Can Carry Comfortably
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English We are commonly asked how much weight can a horse carry? Certainly this is a concern as you do not want to injure a horse by making her carry too much weight. The amount of weight a horse carries depends not only on the horse's size but also conformation, condition, age, and duration and speed of the work to be performed. A starting point is the U.S. Cavalry Manual of Horse Management: published in 1920, it indicated a horse should not carry more than 20% of the weight of the horse including rider, equipment and tack. However, until now, there was no scientific study to prove or disprove this statement. A study was recently published from Ohio State Technical Institute that looked at eight light riding horses and had them carry from 15% to 30% of their body weight while they were exercised using a submaximal mounted standard exercise test. Horses were fitted with a wireless heart rate monitor, and blood samples were taken before and after exercise. The study revealed a weight load of 25% to 30% was found to influence work rate, heart rate, and blood tests. However, horses that carried only 15% to 20% of their body weight did not experience a difference in heart rate, respiratory rate, or work rate compared to riderless horses at exercise. This would indicate the 1920 U.S. Cavalry estimate of 20% of a maximum carrying capacity of a horse printed 90 years ago was pretty accurate. So this would indicate that a 1,000-pound horse should only carry 200 pounds and that includes saddle, rider, and equipment. The only concern is that if a horse is overweight, it does not indicate they can carry more weight because their bones and tendons are the same size, so the 20% should be figured on the horse's normal body weight.

Category: Wellness Visits for Older Horses and Pets
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most folks bring their horses and petsinto the veterinarian for annual vaccinations and many feel that is all that is required for health care. However, as your horse or pet ages, vaccines are not the most important way to maintain your animal’s health. The annual examination is important as your vet should check your pet or horse to make sure all body systems are normal and then address any abnormalities. For this reason, it is important to take your horse or pet to a veterinarian who performs a complete physical exam and does not just give vaccines. Without an an annual exam with the vaccination, you are not getting your money’s worth even if you are paying less because your animal is not getting the health care it deserves. The other important annual procedure that your pet needs is blood work to check for anemia, infection, and liver and kidney function. A urinalysis should be given. These steps are critical in older animals but also should be performed in younger animals just to get a baseline. With a baseline, your vet can not only determine health at this time, but use these results later in life to compare as the animal ages. If your dog is overweight or your cat is underweight, screening for thyroid disease is important. Also, all animals should be routinely checked for heartworm disease annually even if the dog is on heartworm preventative medication. Many horses are overweight and these horses should be screened for equine metabolic syndrome and Cushing’s disease if they are older. Make sure you choose a veterinarian that performs an annual complete physical exam on your pet and horse as this will save you money in the future.

Category: West Nile Protection for your Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Summer and fall are the most important times to have your horse protected against West Nile virus. Dr. Tammy Beckham from the Texas A&M Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory indicates the death rate among horses from West Nile is from 30-40 percent, and of those that recover, 40 percent may still exhibit some symptoms six months or more after recovering from it. Although West Nile is not in the news as much as it was in the past, the diagnostic lab indicates the percentage of horses they tested for West Nile that were positive has increased significantly over the past few years. The virus uses birds as hosts and mosquitoes to transmit the virus. West Nile is now considered to be endemic in the U.S., and transmission to humans and horses is possible. Clinical signs of West Nile include neurological signs such as depression, wobbling, weakness of the legs, lameness, partial paralysis, muscle twitching, and the inability to stand. There are many nervous system diseases that can cause similar symptoms so blood testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. The appropriate test is required because some tests are affected by vaccination and will provide a false positive due to vaccination. Prevention of West Nile infection centers around vaccination as it is difficult to keep mosquitoes off of your horse. Two vaccines are required initially within a 30-day period and then the vaccine is usually administered once or twice yearly, depending on the recommendation of your veterinarian and the horse’s chance of exposure. Using normal methods of decreasing mosquito population, such as eliminating standing water, will help decrease numbers of West Nile cases in both humans and horses.

Category: West Nile Vaccination Response from Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The American Association of Equine Practitioners indicates West Nile is a core vaccine, meaning all horses in the United States should be vaccinated for it. West Nile is transmitted by mosquitoes, causes neurological disease in horses, and has an overall death rate of 33% so it is important to vaccinate your horse for West Nile especially in areas with a heavy mosquito population. Today there are many companies that make West Nile vaccine, either alone as an individual antigen or in combination with other vaccines such as tetanus and encephalitis. The advantage of the combination vaccines is that the horses get less injections. The only disadvantage to combination vaccines is that if your horse has a reaction and you are giving multiple vaccines in the same injection, you will not know which vaccine caused the problem. However, a recent report in the Journal of Equine Veterinary Science indicates there may be another reason to give West Nile vaccine separately. Zoetis Animal Health performed a study by using over 300 horses that did not have titers to West Nile. Some were vaccinated with combination West Nile vaccines, and some with vaccines containing only West Nile; that group was given other vaccines at the same time but as a different injection. The horses given the West Nile vaccine separately had an antibody titer that remained higher for a longer period than horses receiving the combination vaccines. It is believed antigen interference decreased the response to West Nile in the combination products. It is not known if the decrease is significant but it seems to me giving West Nile vaccine separately from other vaccines is probably a good idea.

Category: Wounds between the Horse's Foreleg and Chest
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The area between a horse's foreleg and chest, where the front leg is attached to the chest, is called the axillary area. It is a common area in which horses get injured and lacerated. A wound there can lead to an unusual condition.  Axillary wounds tend to be quite deep and can extend eight to 12 inches upward from the surface of the cut as a wound in this area allows the tissue to separate easily.  Because the wound in most cases is really deep, the cut tissue acts as a one way valve for outside air; it allows air to enter the wound but not exit.  This can lead to an accumulation of air under the all of the horse's skin, not just the area of injury.  It can look like you stuck a needle under the horse's skin and turned on an air compressor.  Fortunately, in most cases the air will be resorbed after a period of time and so it's not dangerous to the horse. However, in some cases, the air can enter the chest and lead to a pneumothorax, a serious and potentially fatal condition in which abnormal air surrounds the lungs and causes rapid and shallow breathing. If this occurs, a large needle must be placed into the horse's chest to remove the air. To prevent air from entering into the wound after it has been explored and cleaned, the wound should be packed with sterile gauze or sterile sponges. The wound can then be sutured except for a small area to remove and replace the gauze.  It is likely the sutures will not hold but the time the sutures do hold allows the wound to start closing and decreases contamination of bacteria and air into the wound.  Wounds that cannot be sutured should have a bandage sutured over the wound to prevent air and bacterial contamination. If your horse develops a wound under the foreleg, call your veterinarian as these wounds can be deadly.

Category: Wrapping that Horse’s Leg?
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English In equine medicine, bandaging leg injuries and wounds is a common practice and in many cases, bandaging and wrapping wounds is indicated. Severe wounds, fractures, and tendon injuries initially require bandaging to immobilize the area. However, it is possible that long-term wrapping and bandaging legs may be doing more harm than good in some cases. It has been shown in humans that appropriate loading of muscle and tendon tissues during healing can decrease healing time. It has also been shown that early controlled mobilization of injured tendons is better than immobilization. Immobilization of tissues with casts or wraps can lead to several problems including a decrease in bone mass and muscle mass when legs are immobile. Early controlled use of the injured area has been shown to decrease healing time and allows the injured tissue fibers to realign more normally and this will help prevent injury in the future. However, if mobilization begins too early, the repair process can be inhibited and healing delayed. Rehab has been extensively studied in human medicine and even the angles of extension and flexion are known for all of the joints. Also, humans can be told that some pain is normal and required in the rehab process. In animals, this is much more difficult as they do not understand rehab is to help them heal and are not cooperative in rehab, and tranquilizers are not a good option. Rehab in small animals has come a long way in just the last few years and a lot is known about rehab of small animal orthopedic surgeries. Equine rehab is being performed but more studies are required. Regardless, long-term wrapping or casting injured horse's legs may be causing more harm than good in some cases.

Category: Acupuncture for Laminitis in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Laminitis is one of the most common conditions in horses and also one of the most difficult to treat.  It is extremely painful and the uncontrollable pain causes many horses to be euthanized.  Hundreds of treatments have been used in these cases and still no one really knows the most effective treatment as most horses receive multiple therapies at the same time. If the horse does respond to treatment, it is difficult to know which therapy was the most helpful. Recently, Dr. Kevin May from California evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating laminitis in conjunction with other therapies.  He indicated 13% of horse barns or owners deal with laminitis every year and 50% of those are referred to hospitals and are eventually euthanized. He indicated there is circumstantial evidence that acupuncture could be helpful in laminitis and wanted to be more scientific.  Dr. May performed a diagnostic acupuncture palpation exam on each horse to help guide his treatment and then applied various acupuncture treatments including dry needling, bleeding an acupuncture site with a needle and injection vitamin B12 at an acupuncture site.  Horses were treated twice 1 week apart and two other vets visually examined the horses for lameness and with an electronic lameness locater.  Treated horses had a significant lower lameness level after the second treatment and this provides at least anecdotal evidence that acupuncture can help with pain from laminitis.  However, there were no control horses in the study and each case was different as each horse received multiple medications at the same time as acupuncture.  Until more evidence is collected, Dr. May recommends considering acupuncture in horses that have not responded to typical laminitis therapy.

Category: Before You Buy That Horse-Pre-Purchase Exams
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Getting a pre-purchase exam before buying a horse is a good idea, but there are many options for these exams. A pre-purchase exam can be anywhere from a thorough physical and lameness exam to multiple tests performed on the horse to determine its health. A general pre-purchase exam usually involves checking all body systems physically and then performing a lameness exam by watching the horse walk and trot to check for lameness. Your veterinarian will check for foot pain and perform flexion tests by flexing various joints to see if this affects the horse’s gait at a walk and a trot. Depending on your veterinarian and your requests, the horse you are considering buying may be ridden for the pre-purchase lameness exam. A pre-purchase evaluation does not include a positive or negative grade or whether the horse fails or passes the exam. The veterinarian’s job is to evaluate the horse medically and will probably not make any suggestions about whether you should or shouldn’t buy the horse. Depending on the purchaser and the planned use of the horse, X-rays or radiographs are sometimes performed to gain further knowledge of the horse's condition. For example, horses used for barrel racing generally have different areas of concern than racehorses, so the veterinarian may have to X-ray different areas. Some purchasers would like the upper airway examined with an endoscope, while others will request a reproductive exam if the horse will be used for breeding. If possible, the veterinarian may want to look at earlier medical records. Realize that even with a pre-purchase exam, your veterinarian does not have a crystal ball to see the horse’s future and only has to consider how the horse looks on the day of the exam.

Category: Contracted Heels in Horses and Metal Horseshoes
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Contracted heels in horses can lead to lameness and many people believe this is caused by metal shoes. Heel contraction in horses involves narrowing of the caudal (toward the tail) part of the hoof including the frog, buttress, and heel bulbs. To determine if a heel is contracted, you can measure the width of the heel 2 ½ inches from the buttress and compare that distance to the width 1 inch from the toe. If the width of the heel is the smaller of the two measurements, the heel is contracted. Another method is to measure the length of the frog and compare that to the width of the frog. If the width is less than 67% or 1/3 of the length of the frog, the heel is contracted. Although metal shoes are blamed for causing heel contraction, there is no scientific evidence to support this. A study was performed in Poland on 114 horses from 22 different premises. Results showed that the use of metal horseshoes was not related to heel contraction but that heel contraction is a multifactorial problem with many different related causes. In many cases, heel contraction is related to the breed involved as well as poor trimming and shoeing techniques. Only about 8% of feral horses have contracted heels but up to 100% of the domestic horses in one study had contracted heels. However, it made no difference if the horses that had contracted heels were shod or not. Some believe that horseshoes restrict the movement of the heels and lead to contraction, but this does not appear to be the case. One previous study did find that horseshoes could have an effect on contraction but these horses were running on a hard surface versus working on a grass pasture. So, if your horse needs shoes, it is unlikely the use of shoes will lead to contracted heels as long as the horse has access to soft ground and is trimmed properly.

Category: Hard Surface Impacts on Horse's Limbs
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Several years ago, a group of French scientists developed a pressure sensitive horse shoe called a dynamometric shoe. They believed the shoe would help determine the effects of different surfaces on injury. These veterinarians recently presented a paper proving that a hard track does increase the chance of injury. And although this may be expected by many horsemen, it has not been looked a scientifically until now. The scientists used the dynamometric shoe on selected fore and hind hooves of ridden and driven horses, and the shoe provided information about forces and loading rates at each instance of the stance. Synchronized cameras provided high-speed video footage to allow the scientists to monitor the movement frame by frame so they could measure all angles of joints, tendons and ligaments. During the stance, the horse’s hooves come in contact with the surface, and slide and sink into the surface; how far depends on the surface. The study looked at different kinds of footing, top layer thickness and surface maintenance methods. It was found that hard tracks are associated with a much higher injury rate than softer ones. A recent study followed 12 standard bred horses over four months and those training on a hard sand track developed 50 percent more tendon injuries than those training on a soft sand track. They also studied jumping horses on sand footing with three different thicknesses of 3, 5, and 8 inches, and the 3-inch thick surface was the most likely to cause injury. They also found that harrowing the surface was much better to prevent injury than rolling the surface. Consequently, frequent harrowing and using a sand surface greater than 5 inches or more is recommended to prevent injury.

Category: Healthy Hooves Help Arthritic Joints in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Nancy S. Loving, DVM, author at the publicationThe Horse,writes that healthy hooves are especially important if your horse has arthritic joints. Trimming and shoeing techniques can alter a horse’s biomechanics and make the horse more painful or can lessen the pain from arthritis. Horses with arthritis try to shorten their stride to reduce the load on the arthritic joints, and it is believed the pain is associated with the concussion of impact and extreme range of motion. Materials that decrease the impact on the foot, like soft sand, custom arena footing, or specialty shoeing materials, can decrease pain on impact. When picking up your arthritic horse’s leg, be aware of the range of motion and decrease it as much as possible. Many horses have an increased range of motion when the range of motion is exceeded, which is why veterinarians perform flexion tests on horses when evaluating lameness. Rolling the toe has been shown to decrease breakover, making it easier and quicker to get the foot off the ground and decreasing pain. Another concern is hoof balance. This term is difficult to define, but the hoof may be imbalanced if the coronary band is asymmetrical. This shows that the foot is not growing symmetrically. The side of the hoof wall with the most load has decreased growth and is complicating the issue. Unbalanced hooves can lead to arthritis due to excessive pressure on specific areas. Heel support is essential, and the heel should be trimmed to the base of the frog for the best support. However, elevating the heels is not always a good idea as this can increase pressure in the coffin joint. Correctly trimmed feet and possible shoeing with pads can decrease pain and arthritis in many different horses, but incorrect shoeing and trimming can also lead to lameness if done improperly. The type of shoe can also increase or decrease lameness. Consult with your veterinarian if you have questions about your arthritic horse and the most beneficial trimming and shoeing type. Information you receive can be communicated to your farrier, helping your horse receive the best care possible.

Category: Hoof Care in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English The old saying "no hoof, no horse" is really true. If your horse's feet have problems, then the horse is basically unusable. Hoof care is critical to prevent lameness problems, and Dr. Robin Dabareiner from Texas A&M indicates in Remuda magazine that the environment has a major effect on the horse's hoof. Hoof quality can vary from farm to farm in the same area due to different drainage issues and different temperatures can also have an effect. June through August in Texas is usually hot and dry and the horse's feet get extremely dry and hard. Because of this, it is difficult to diagnose a problem such as an abscess, sole bruising, or even laminitis. Most horses will have much slower hoof growth during the hot time of the year and because the hoof dries out, the hoof wall and sole separates and when dirt or sand is pushed into the separation, the hoof wall breaks out leaving the horse walking on the sole and not the wall. This can lead to bruising, abscesses, and hoof wall cracks.During these dry times, it is important to use a product to increase moisture in the hoof, such as Hoof Maker or Valentines Dressing. It is important to use a lanolin-based product and not an oil-based product as oil can prevent the hoof from breathing. The moisture provided by these products causes the hoof to grow during the dry summer and you can apply these products to the wall and sole every other day during the hot dry summer. As the weather changes in the fall and winter and we start getting some rain, the hooves get softer and flatten out, which can lead to other problems. As the ground becomes wet, these dry feet pick up moisture, causing the hooves to get softer and the hoof flattens out, which can cause increased bruising. Also, too much moisture can cause the hoof wall to separate. Dr. Dabareiner uses a good analogy of this syndrome by comparing it to separating in same way that wet plywood separates. When the wall breaks off, nails for the shoe must be placed even higher, and that further weakens the wall. This can lead to white line disease, abscesses, thrush, or canker. Treatment required is drying out the hoof wall and sole so the first thing to do is get the horse out of the water and into a dry stall. Applying a product like Durasole to the hoof wall and sole can aid in drying the hoof. Even wet dew on the grass can cause enough moisture to create a problem. In the morning, the feet get wet and then dry out in the afternoon, and then they are wet again the next morning and the cycle continues. The hoof wall separates, nails loosen, and the horse loses a shoe and maybe the farrier is blamed but in most cases it is not the farrier's fault. The same problem can occur when horses at pasture in the summer walk into the farm pond to drink and get their feet wet and then the feet dry out. All of this leads to brittle, cracking hoof walls. When owners see the hooves cracking, they may let their water trough run over to try to water the feet. But watering only compounds the problem and the best treatment is to use a hoof sealant to seal the feet.

Category: Horse Hoof Sole Packing Reduces Impact Vibrations
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English If your horse works on hard surfaces such as hard and dry ground or paved streets, eventually this surface hardness can lead to musculoskeletal damage.  Ideally, horses would be maintained on a variety of surfaces with minimal hard surface exercise but in some situations, this is not possible.  Dr. Amy Barstow indicates atthehorse.comthat this is the case with police horses or even leisure horses when there is a severe drought and the ground is very hard. Dr. Barstow recently investigated a pour-in polyurethane sole packing material to help reduce sole trauma and found it helps reduce certain forms of vibration and forces in the hoof.  The theory is that when polyurethane absorbs the shock from the hoof impacting the ground, it prevents the shock from traveling further up the leg where it could cause wear and tear injuries.  The researchers tested five sound horses in four shoeing conditions with standard steel shoes and standard aluminum shoes, both with and without sole packing.  They used an accelerometer to measure vibration and forces as each horse trotted across hard ground.  Results indicated that impact was 30% less in the horses with sole packing regardless of the type shoe used, but total vibration was less in the aluminum shoes with packing compared to the steel shoes.  So, the sole packing made a big difference in the vibration transmitted up the limb. However, this does not indicate every horse on hard ground should have sole packing.  Also, realize this was a controlled study and problems can occur with sole packing in the real world because if the horse stands around the water trough, moisture can eventually get under the packing and can cause the sole to soften and loss of sole, so work with your vet and farrier closely to see if sole packing is the best for your horse.

Category: How Hind Hooves Are Trimmed Can Affect Your Horse’s Posture
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Yogi Sharp, DipWCF, BSc Hons., based in Brighton, England,and founder ofThe EquineDocumentalist,indicates in the publicationThe Horsethat when a horse’s hind hooves are out of balance, this could mean poor posture, leading to other difficulties for the horse. Abnormal trimming of a horse’s hind feet could contribute to a cycle of issues that could cause problems all the way up the rear legs to the back, neck, and even the head. Specifically, a long toe and low heel conformation cause horses to have a so-called “canted-in” or “standing under” posture and can even be linked to jaw pain. As a farrier, Dr. Sharp says that he regularly manages horses with a canted-in posture in which their hind feet are pulled up under the trunk. This is common when a horse has low heels and long toes and is called abnormal compensated posture, requiring increased effort of the horse's muscles to maintain and can lead to muscular pain. He said all the horses he works with that have poor hind-foot balance also have terrible posture, and he believes some of this is due to domestication. In one study, 12 horses with negative plantar angles were examined. This abnormal condition is when the back of the coffin bone is lower than the front of the coffin bone. The 12 subject horses were all standing with their back feet further forward than normal, and Dr. Sharp trimmed and shod the horses to create a straight hoof pastern axis by using wedge pads. The researchers found significant improvement in angles and posture after treatment, concluding that the position and orientation of the rear hooves can affect the positioning of other joints. The hind feet are commonly overlooked in horses as most of the focus is on the front feet. From this research, it is concluded that a horse’s hind feet need to be examined more closely, and if long toes and low heels are noted, a change in conformation could positively affect the entire horse.

Category: Long Toes Related to Horse's Hip Pain
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Some horses appear to be sensitive over the hip area. Multiple causes are suspected, including arthritis in the hip area and pain in the lower legs that cause abnormal movement of the back and hips. Riders of these horses with pain on pressure over the hips also reported performance problems, resistance to the rider, and a stiff or irregular gait. Several equine veterinarians at North Carolina State felt it was possible that the length of the horse's toe on the hind feet could be another cause of pain over the hip. Horses with long toes also usually have low heels that are crushed or collapsed. This causes the load bearing area to be further forward of the center of the rear legs. Because of this, horses stand with their rear feet further forward than normal. Another way of looking at this is the horse stands with the back feet standing up under themselves instead of straight and this also gives the horse a sickle hock appearance. Because of this stance, the muscles of the entire limb are pulled abnormally and can affect the horse's posture and movement. To prove this theory, the vets at North Carolina State performed a study that checked for pain over the horse's hip area and compared that to toe length of the rear feet. It was found that horses with hip pain had longer toes in the rear feet than horses without hip pain, and that pain could be decreased fairly quickly by trimming the toes shorter. X-rays are required to determine the distance the toes need to be trimmed, but in general most light breed adult horses should not have toes longer than 20mm past the apex of the frog. So in most cases if you look at the soles of your horse's rear feet, the end of the toe should not be over 20mm from the apex of the frog.

Category: Many Equine Hoof Problems Require X-rays
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Hoof problems are very common in horses, and many of these require radiographs to treat correctly. Most farriers do a great job, but regardless of their ability, they cannot see inside the hoof capsule without an X-ray. Farriers are often asked to treat conditions that are suspected to have or have been previously diagnosed with a condition that is impossible to treat correctly without X-rays. Without X-rays, you are requiring your farrier to guess at the sole depth and the location and conformation of the coffin bone. It is impossible to know how long to trim the toe and how to trim the hoof to align the coffin bone properly without knowing these parameters. Not every horse needs radiographs prior to being trimmed. However, if your horse has a foot problem, X-rays can help the farrier do a better job. X-rays are critical in a horse with laminitis (or founder). In this disease, the coffin bone inside the hoof wall moves, so the trim cannot be performed correctly without knowing the location of the bone. Some farriers may try to treat these cases without X-rays, possibly because owners do not want to spend the money. However, this is an example where your horse will suffer without X-rays regardless of the experience or skill of your farrier. Many horses with laminitis have thin soles. The thickness of the sole must be known to trim and shoe the horse correctly. Correct trimming is the basis of the treatment of laminitis, so baseline X-rays are needed. In chronic cases of laminitis, horses should be rechecked in 3-6 months to make sure the trimming is correct. X-rays can be helpful in trimming horses without hoof problems as well since many horses’ toes are not trimmed short enough by farriers. X-rays pinpoint the exact location for trimming the toe.

Category: Riding Arena Footing Materials for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about the different footing materials used for equine riding arenas.  There is good information on this topic at thePenn State College of Agriculture website. Penn indicates the perfect arena surface should be cushioned to minimize concussion on the horse’s legs, firm enough to provide traction, not too slick or dusty, not too abrasive to horse’s hooves, and easy to maintain.  It is difficult to meet all of these criteria and make a recommendation because some materials are only available in certain areas and even sand differs from one geographic place to another.  Regardless, a successful arena surface is no better than the underlying base. The base is a hard-packed material that supports a road surface.  The loose footing material is installed on top of the base. The first important component for footing materials is the size of the particles; when all materials are the same size, it cannot compact and can be unstable for riding at speed.  In contrast, when many different particle sizes are used the material can compact too greatly and be hard and packed, so the goal would be to use enough different size particles to be stable but not so many that the surface would be too compacted.  The second important component for footing materials is the particle shape as a sharply angular material is more prone to compact than less angular particles.  Particles need some angularity to offer resistance to movement between them as round particles have no resistance to movement and would be unstable.  Before you decide to just fill your riding arena with sand, do your research as you can see there are lots of options.

Category: Seasons Affect Travel Patterns and Hoof Growth in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A study was recently published in the Journal of Equine Veterinary Science concerning the movement of horses and hoof growth. In most horses, the hoof grows about 8-10 mm per month, but this rate can possibly be affected by age, breed, nutrition and environment. As far as movement, horses in the wild travel 16 to 20 hours per day and this pattern is important for the horse's psychological well-being. This is probably why we have so many problems with horses that are stalled most of the time as stalling is unnatural for horses. The study performed at the University of Connecticut looked at 10 horses that were stalled for about seven hours per day and turned out the rest of the time with GPS trackers. All horses were trimmed and reshod every 6 weeks and hoof growth was checked. Results indicated that front and rear hooves grew the same amount and there was no difference in hoof growth between geldings and mares. Hoof growth in the winter was decreased and hooves grew more in the fall than any other season so your horse may need to be trimmed more often in the fall and less often in winter. Surprisingly, the average distance the horses travelled was about equal in all seasons. The horses actually moved farther from the barn area in spring and summer but although horses stayed around the barn and feeding area for shelter in the winter, GPS trackers indicated they still took as many steps in the fall and winter, just in a different direction. So although the horses moved in a smaller area in the winter, they still covered the same amount of distance. This information suggests that regardless of the weather, horses need to be turned out to maintain natural travel patterns.

Category: Sheared Heels in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about a condition in horses called sheared heels. When you look at the back of your horse's foot, both heels should be basically the same height on all feet. In some horses, one heel may be displaced higher than the other one, and this is called sheared heels. Sheared heals develop when the weight of the horse is not evenly divided between the inside of the foot and the outside of the foot. Eventually, the increased load on one side pushes the heel on that side higher, and the compression of this area leads to conditions that can lead to lameness, including quarter cracks. Dr. Steve O'Grady indicates in Equine Veterinary Education that true quarter cracks are cracks that develop at the coronary band. Although hoof cracks may occur at the quarters and begin at the solar surface, these are not true quarter cracks as a true quarter crack begins at the coronary band and extends downward. These cracks involve the full thickness of the hoof wall and cause lameness due to inflammation and infection. Also, these cracks are painful due to pinching of the hoof wall on the underlying tissue. Treatment of sheared heels, especially if there is a quarter crack, can be difficult and requires a dedicated farrier and veterinarian. Basically, the foot should be trimmed level and then a bar shoe may be applied. The area under the crack is decreased in height and this will allow the higher heel to sink downward onto the shoe and stabilize the area. The horse needs to be taken out of training and as few nails used to apply the shoe as necessary to allow the heel to settle onto the shoe. Quarter cracks cannot be treated the same as cracks starting at the ground surface.

Category: Subsolar Bruising in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A problem we see in our practice quite frequently is a horse with a bruised sole.  There are many causes of bruising including using a horse on hard or rocky ground that has soft soles.  Also, some horses can be shod incorrectly and a shoe can pinch the sole and cause pressure or the horse can be trimmed too short and cause bruising.  The sole is not designed to support weight and flat-footed horses are prone to chronic bruising.  Some horses also have thin soles, and these horses are susceptible to bruising when used on hard ground. For many years treatment of subsolar bruising has involved soaking the foot to supposedly draw out or relieve inflammation.  However, Dr Steve O’Grady, an equine podiatrist, indicates that soaking the foot for more than 2 to 3 days can actually worsen the problem by softening the sole and decreasing the its protection.  Foot bruising is commonly seen in show horses that are bathed continually as the excessive moisture weakens the hoof wall.  As the wall weakens, cracks develop and the sole gets closer to the ground and increases the chance of bruising. Dr. O’Grady mentions that the treatment for bruising should be just the opposite.  Instead of softening the sole with soaking, we should instead try to toughen the sole for protection.  The horse should be placed in a dry stall to promote drying of the sole and a product designed to toughen the sole such as formalin and iodine mixtures can be used topically.  Some of these deep bruises take a long time to heal but these bruised areas should not be opened with a hoof knife like an abscess, as this will only cause further pain and delay healing.

Category: Thoroughbred Horse's Feet
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Thoroughbred horses have historically poor quality feet and Dr. Scott Morrison indicates in Equine Disease Quarterly that the thoroughbred foot is light and lacks the mass for protection that is seen in heavier-boned breeds. The thinner walls and sole make the thoroughbred’s foot more susceptible to trauma, injury, and hoof capsule distortion, (which includes flaring of the walls, cracks, underrun heels, collapsed heels and sheared heels), all of which can lead to lameness. Since the heel region is designed to impact the ground first in horses to dissipate vibrations, the heel is usually the first area of the foot to display distortion because it is made up of soft and elastic structures. The most common foot imbalance occurs when feet are shod with too much toe length and inadequate heel length. The center of the shoe’s weight-bearing surface should line up with the center of the coffin joint, which is aligned with the widest part of the sole. Balanced shoeing around the coffin joint helps to distribute force over the entire solar surface. The horse’s foot has the ability to handle large impact forces without collapsing and hoof capsule deformities develop slowly over time. Racehorses and other show horses spend 22 or more hours a day standing in a straw bedded stall, and Dr. Morrison believes this leads to most of the hoof distortions. Horses standing in a stall have little sole support, which over time allows fatigue of the hoof capsule. When horses are outside on the track or on other surfaces, the sole packs with dirt or sand and the sole is supported. Using temporary arch supports bandaged on to the feet when stalled, or heart-bar shoes, can aid in supporting the sole and help prevent hoof distortion.

Category: Thrush in Horse’s Hooves
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Thrush in horses is a fairly common problem especially at the time of year when horses stand around in wet muddy areas.  Although standing in water or mud does not cause the disease, I think it decreases the integrity of the sole and frog to fight off infection and enable infection to enter the tissues easier than it would if the horse was on a hot dry summer pasture.  Dr. Steve O’Grady says thrush is a degenerative condition of the frog caused by a bacterial infection, which leads to deterioration of the frog and a black necrotic type of discharge with a foul odor.  If the infection is severe, it can infect the sensitive tissues of the foot causing pain and lameness. Almost all cases of thrush are caused by incorrect trimming of the frog and sole that allow deep sulci (the clefts on either side of and in the middle of the frog) to develop. Some will have one deep central sulcus of the frog extending to the hairline at the heel.  Although there are many products available to treat thrush, none of these products will be effective until the foot is trimmed correctly.  If the frog is recessed and the hoof wall is too long, allowing a deep sulcus to develop, no treatment is going to be effective without appropriate foot trimming.  The frog should be in contact with the ground when the horse bears weight on the foot.  Horses that are not trimmed often enough in whom the hoof wall has grown too long, or those with shoes that raise the frog above the ground, can develop contracted heels; this allows thrush to develop. So, if your horse develops thrush, make sure the horse is trimmed correctly and do not expect any treatment to be effective until the foot is correctly trimmed.  In general, the hoof wall at the heel should be on the same plane as the frog for the foot to function properly.

Category: Trimming and Reshoeing Gives Comfort to Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A recent study looked at the effects of foot trimming on a horse’s behavior. A study discussed in The Horse publication says that in the week following foot trimming and reshoeing, horses in the study took more steps than before the trim and seemed to spend more time in a relaxed position.  Dr. Jay Daniel is a professor at Berry College in Georgia, and in his study the scientists fitted seven riding horses with accelerometers on one hind limb and the horses wore the device for 23 hours a day over a 2-week period.  When half-way through the study period, three of the horses underwent trimming and reshoeing. The other four, the non-treated control group, underwent the handling associated with trimming and shoeing but the procedure was not performed. The horses with fresh trims and shoes spent more time lying down after the trim than before the trim, and this makes it seem that horses were lying down more, indicating their feet were painful.  However, Dr. Daniel believes this means the horses were more relaxed and were lying down for that reason, not for pain.  There was no evidence of pain, tenderness or heat in the feet, so no foot soreness was noted.  Also, the lying down period was not exceptionally long but was significantly longer that before the trim.  Dr. Daniel says the study shows that most horses are actually more comfortable after trimming and shoeing than before, and that trimming and shoeing by a qualified farrier should not make their horses uncomfortable. My concern with this study is the small number of horses involved and that the assertion that the horses were lying down more because they were relaxed is an assumption by the author.

Category: Hay Damaged by Rain for Horses and Cattle
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Damage occurs when your hay is cut and rained on before you are able to bale it. Dr. Brian Pugh of Oklahoma State Extension indicates at cattlenetwork.com that hay that has been cut and rained on can lose quality in four ways. The first is 1) leaching of soluble carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals, 2) increased plant respiration, 3) leaf shattering and finally 4) microbial breakdown of plant tissue. Leaching of carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals is usually at its highest when the hay has already dried some and then a prolonged rain occurs. Rainfall right after cutting usually results in less leaching of nutrients and a small shower has very little effect on leaching of nutrients at all. Increased or prolonged respiration occurs when hay is not allowed to dry sufficiently to stop the plant’s metabolic processes. The hay must be at less than 30 percent moisture for respiration to be reduced to acceptable levels and hay that is green when rained on will continue to respire for long periods, decreasing the quality and yield of the hay. Increasing leaf shatter occurs with hay that has been rained on because more mechanical handling of the hay is required to dry it. Increased raking tends to shatter leaves from the stems and since more of the nutrient is in the leaves, raking and baling can reduce the quality of the hay substantially. Hay lying on the ground can be consumed by organisms that lead to loss of dry matter and yield. One study indicated cut hay can lose 5 percent of dry matter per inch of rain, so if you have some hay that received substantial rain after cutting, it is a good idea to send the hay off to a lab for analysis so you can determine its quality.

Category: Moldy Hay Fed to Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Moldy hay is a year-round concern but most of the reasons hay develops mold are related to problems at harvest. Dr. Sally Flis at Equi-Analytical Lab indicates there is a concern for moldy hay because the if mold develops during storage, there is a loss of dry matter in the hay plus a loss of total digestible nutrients because mold eats the hay before your horse can. The other issue is that moldy hay can cause major issues with the horse's respiratory tract and can cause allergic reactions. Some horses are extremely sensitive to the allergens in mold and this can lead to inflammatory airway disease. Many horses with heaves or COPD are very sensitive to environmental allergens in the hay and will have a difficult time breathing if fed moldy hay. Lastly, most horses do not like to eat moldy hay so there may be a palatability problem. Mold can develop on hay through several methods, and one is that if the weather is cool and wet, mold can develop on grass before it is even cut to bail. If it is cool and wet, hay takes longer to dry because the soil is wet and the hay absorbs moisture from the wet soil. Also, many times hay gets rained on after being cut and before bailing and the longer it takes to dry, the greater the chance of mold developing. Raking the hay to facilitate drying soon after a rain will help decrease the amount of mold growth. Baling hay that has a moisture content greater than 14 percent will increase the chance of mold developing. If you feel your hay has mold but are not sure, you can have the hay tested to determine the risk of using it as not all moldy hay has to be discarded; depends on the level of mold.

Category: Nitrate and Nitrite Poisoning in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on Texas Vet News I am going to talk about nitrate and nitrite poisoning in horses. Fortunately, Dr. Cynthia Gaskill indicates in Equine Disease Quarterly that this poisoning is fairly rare in horses and is much more common in ruminants such as cattle and sheep. The reason is that horses are not very susceptible to nitrates and their bodies do not readily change nitrate to nitrite, which is more toxic. However, ruminants have microorganisms in the digestive tracts that are efficient at changing nitrates to nitrites and so they are more susceptible to nitrate and nitrite poisoning. Ingestion of large amounts of nitrate in horses usually causes gastrointestinal problems like colic and diarrhea. Nitrate poisoning usually occurs when horses ingest contaminated water, nitrate fertilizer, or hay grown at the site of a fertilizer spill. Nitrates can accumulate in plants depending on the stage of growth, amount of fertilization, and plant stress. Most of the nitrate accumulates in the stalk of the plant, less in the leaves, and very little in the seed. If horses are exposed to nitrite, it is extremely poisonous and causes difficulty breathing, wobbling, seizures and rapid death. Fortunately, the only times horses get exposed to nitrite is when they ingest high-nitrate hay that is baled wet and microorganisms in the hay have changed the nitrate to nitrite. To prevent this problem, never feed moldy or wet hay and do not bale hay when it is wet. Also, never haul water in fertilizer tanks even if they have been washed out.

Category: Equine Reflex Hypertonia (Stringhalt)
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Equine Reflex Hypertonia is an abnormal gait caused by a neuromuscular condition. It is more commonly called “stringhalt” because the jerky, hesitant hyperflexion of the horse’s affected hind limb (or limbs) resembles a puppet being pulled by a string. Your horse may walk with an exaggerated movement, holding the affected hind limb up unnaturally high before setting it down again. This odd gait is more obvious at the walk and less at the trot or canter. It may seem worse when your horse backs up, turns, or starts to walk after standing still. What Causes Stringhalt? Stringhalt is usually divided into two types: idiopathic (meaning the cause is not known) or acquired, also called Australian or plant/pasture associated. Pasture-associated stringhalt:(PSH) Usually occurs when a horse has been kept on pasture during the late summer or early autumn when forage is not at its best quality or if toxic plants have been allowed to grow. Horses grazing in different pastures but in the same general area may develop it as the same toxic plants can grow across a wide area. Certain types of toxic weeds found in Australia, New Zealand and the US have been associated with the condition. If overgrazing, drought, or other issues have left a pasture in poor nutritional condition, horses may eat plants that they otherwise wouldn’t touch. But horses are foragers, so it’s natural for them to sample things even if they are on a well-maintained pasture. Plant-associated stringhalt is not very common in the United States. Toxic Weeds Known to Cause Stringhalt The weedHypochaeris radicata,commonly called false dandelion, is native to Europe but also grows in several other countries (giving this type of stringhalt the name Australian or pasture-associated), including North and South America. This weed is hard to tell from genuine dandelions, which are not toxic. The sweet pea plant,Lathyrus spp.,also found in the US, is another suspected contributor to plant-associated stringhalt. Plant-associated stringhalt usually clears up when the horse is removed from the source. Australian (idiopathic) stringhalt:The cause is unknown, and with this type, the condition may be progressive and can be quite severe. Treatment If your horse’s condition is due to plant toxicity, it should clear up after the toxins are removed, and no further treatment is needed. In the case of idiopathic stringhalt, your horse may recover on their own. In chronic cases, surgical intervention can be a possibility. The surgery involves the tendons and muscles of the affected limbs, and recovery and outcome depend on the severity of the condition and the horse’s overall health. Not all cases respond to surgery. Other treatments may include thiamine, a vitamin B1 supplement, and phenytoin, an anticonvulsant. Stringhalt is considered an unsoundness but it doesn’t necessarily mean your horse cannot have a fulfilling life. Signs may be sporadic and may even disappear during warm weather. However, the condition may make your horse unsuitable for some equestrian activities. If you suspect your horse is showing signs of stringhalt, your veterinarian is your best resource for advice and treatment information.

Category: Plant Toxins and Liver Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Liver disease is not common in horses, but when it occurs it is usually due to toxins the horse has eaten. Signs of liver disease include decreased appetite, depression, colic, yawning, behavioral abnormalities, and yellowish coloration of the mucous membranes. Many plants contain a chemical called pyrrolizidine alkaloids, a class of plant toxins associated with disease in humans and animals. Horses ingesting these plants over a long period can develop liver disease. Some of the plants known to contain this chemical are Senecio and groundsel. Horses do not generally eat these plants unless there is nothing else to eat or it is baled in the hay. Cocklebur is another plant common in some western states, and at the 2-leaf stage, seedlings contain a large amount of a toxic chemical. The seedlings appear early in the spring before many other plants are growing, and are readily consumed by horses. It is important in the early spring to make sure horses have good quality hay and do not have access to cocklebur seedlings. Aflatoxin, another common toxin, is produced by molds on multiple different grains, especially when the plants have been stressed by drought or insects. The mold can grow on stored grain if stored in warm and damp conditions, and the toxin can be present without seeing mold on the grain. Always buy your horse’s feed from reputable sources, making sure that it is stored in a cool, dry location. If the grain has not been evaluated for aflatoxin, you can ask about having it sent off for testing. Blue-green algae is another toxin concern. Under certain conditions, these microscopic organisms undergo rapid growth called algal blooms on stock ponds and produce a toxin that affects the liver in horses. If your horse has access to a farm pond with the colored sheen of an algal bloom on the top, remove your horse from this pasture and use another source of water.

Category: Rattlesnake Bites' Effect on Horses' Hearts
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A recent study was published that examined the effect of a snakebite on the horse's heart muscle. Rattlesnake bites in horses are fairly common in rattlesnake territories. Symptoms vary from just a mild swelling to severe swelling and even death depending on location, the amount of venom injected, and the size of the horse. Most horses are bitten on the nose because they are curious. Horses cannot breathe out of their mouth, and the bite causes so much swelling in the nose that they cannot breathe. This swelling is usually the most serious initial problem in snakebite cases that must be dealt with as an emergency. Some horses will require a tracheotomy to breath, in which the vet makes an incision into the trachea in the horse's neck and places a tube for air so the horse does not have to breathe out of the nose. And certainly horses cannot drink if the mouth is also very swollen, so many horses require intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration; if they are bit on the nose, you certainly cannot pass a tube in their stomach to give them water. Anti-inflammatories and pain medication are also used, and a plasma antivenin has been shown to help. Depending on the report you read, anywhere from 9 to 25 percent of horses bitten by rattlesnakes die. A recent study in Veterinary Internal Medicine indicated that 70 percent of the horses bitten developed cardiac arrythmias and 40 percent developed damage to the heart muscle. This may be another reason some horses die after a bite when they seem to be doing well. A rattlesnake vaccine and antivenin is available for horses. We do not know if either of these options decrease damage to the heart in the event of a bite.

Category: Toxins Can Cause Heart Disease in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Fortunately, heart disease is not common in horses but when it does occur, it can be serious. Some heart disease in horses can be caused by toxins. Dr. Megan Romano is a toxicology resident at the University of Kentucky Diagnostic Lab and she indicates that a common poisoning occurs when horses are exposed to feed containing a compound called an ionophore. Ionophores are commonly used in cattle to increase feed efficiency and promote weight gain but are toxic to horses, and toxicosis occur when this ingredient is mistakenly added to horse feed or when a horse is allowed to eat cattle feed. Ionophore exposure causes heart failure in horses with poor performance and sometimes sudden death. Another heart toxicity is exposure to the blister beetles commonly found in alfalfa hay. If a significant amount of blister beetles are ingested, damage to the heart muscle can occur, which can be deadly. Exposure to an ornamental yew or taxus can also affect the horse's heart and all parts of the plant or toxic. Ingestion of just a small amount of the yew shrub can cause heart failure and death so you want to make sure a horse property does not have any yew or taxus shrubs that horses could consume. Some other plants that can affect the horse's heart include white snakeroot, rhododendrons, azaleas, laurels, and fetterbush. Also milkweed are wildflowers cultivated as ornamentals and these can also be toxic to a horse’s heart. Many of these plants are not palatable to horses when growing but may be consumed if baled in hay, so always inspect your hay and if you see unusual plants, get them checked out before feeding the hay.

Category: Abnormal Behavior in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Wood chewing and crib biting (also called cribbing) are common undesirable horse behaviors. These behaviors are usually associated with a problem in the environment. A group of vets from the University of Bristol in England indicated in Equine Vet Journal that in horses at pasture these conditions may be related to a diet low in fiber or other nutrients. Wood chewing was shown to be related to diets consisting of concentrates only as compared to those fed only hay. Wood eating is observed to a lesser extent in horses at pasture but it tends to happen on fences and trees during the spring when the sugar content of the pasture is high and fiber content is low. Also, some believe wood chewing can lead to cribbing, in which the horse grabs a solid object and pulls back with the front teeth while sucking in air; that is sometimes called wind sucking. Cribbing is also associated with low-forage and high-fat diets. Increased fiber intake increases chewing, and the horse chews, the more saliva that is produced. Horses that produce more saliva by being fed more hay have been shown to crib less than horses fed complete pelleted feeds. The increased saliva also increases the pH of the stomach and decreases the chance of stomach ulcers and subsequent colic. Since horses that crib are known to have an increased incidence of colic, this could be part of the reason. Although these unwanted behaviors are not this simple in many cases, it is obvious that enabling horses to show normal behavior by interacting socially with other horses and increasing their time spent grazing is likely to aid in decreasing wood chewing and cribbing. Decreasing pelleted feed, increasing hay, and allowing the horse out with other horses is a good start.

Category: Antianxiety Supplements in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Some horses are anxious in certain situations such as loading in a trailer or at an event such as a barrel race.  There are lots of products on the market that claim to calm your horse and most of these are supplements that are not FDA-approved and have no proof that they are effective.  Researchers at the University of Guelph in Canada performed a study to compare the effects of acepromazine which is a tranquilizer requiring a prescription from your veterinarian to a magnesium based antianxiety formulation that is a supplement. Horses were treated and heart rate and cortisol levels were checked to determine the amount of anxiety when performing certain tasks such as loading in the trailer, walking onto a scale, and riding in a trailer.  Results indicated that all of the tasks did produce a stress response and that acepromazine and the magnesium supplement did seem to decrease anxiety while the control substance was not effective.  The concern with acepromazine is that it cannot be used in competition and there are side effects of acepromazine that many folks do not know about.  Although many horse folks feel a little shot of acepromazine is no big deal, acepromazine can cause an irregular heartbeat and low blood pressure, and in geldings can cause penile prolapse and inability to retract the penis.  For this reason, I use very little acepromazine, especially in male horses.  The magnesium supplement did produce some calming and might be worth trying if your horse has anxiety.  There are also a lot of folks using illegal substances for calming their horses, most of which are human antidepressants.  Many have dangerous side effects so avoid these human drugs in your horse regardless of claims from the internet The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Behavioral Problems in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Emanuela Dalla Costa, DVM, PhD., of the University of Milan, Italy, states in the publicationThe Horsethat many behavioral problems in horses are likely due to their domestication. Cribbing, weaving, and other behaviors in horses are related to environmental changes, causing frustration because their biological needs are not being met. These repetitive vices are useless behaviors that develop in horses in domestic environments and do not occur in free-ranging feral horses. This is due to structural changes in the brain and is more involved than just stable vices or bad habits. Dr. Dalla Costa says horses get blamed for these behaviors and it is not their fault. Stable vices cause problems for the horse caretakers, and we need to realize horses with these behaviors are unhappy. Horses are not the only animals that develop unwanted behaviors. All animals have one thing in common, and that is vice-like behaviors only occur in captive animals. Horses do not develop these types of behaviors because of boredom, nor do they pick them up from other horses. Vices occur because they do not like their environment or the stress of the situation. Horses in stalls have limited ability to move, spend less time eating, and can’t express a flight response when they feel threatened. These horses are frustrated. They perceive they are constantly stopped from doing what they want or need to do, leading to negative emotions such as anger, annoyance, and disappointment. Rather than try to change their behaviors by using restraints or cribbing straps, changing the environment to help your horse feel more comfortable is the best treatment option.

Category: Calming Drugs for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horse owners and trainers commonly ask veterinarians for medications to calm their horse for training or showing purposes. Veterinarians have to be careful about dispensing these drugs. You have to realize that after treating a horse with a sedative, the horse could become dangerous to the rider; if an accident happened, I am concerned the vet could be partially liable from having dispensed the drug. There are some dietary supplements commercially available for horses and although there is almost no scientific information about the effectiveness of these products, they have been used for years. Some of the common ingredients have a basis in theory in other species. Dr. Sue McDonnell indicates that one example is l-tryptophan, which is a common ingredient in many commercial calming supplements as it is a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin. L-tryptophan has been shown to induce calm and fatigue-like behavior in several species, and at 1 to 2 grams twice daily it has a mild calming affect on stalled horses. Another available product is a pheromone called Modipher EQ. This product has been used in situations involving fear, stress, and anxiety, such as feet trimming or hauling. The pheromone approach to behavior modification sounds like a really good idea. Unfortunately, the controlled blind studies at Dr. McDonnell's University of Penn Equine behavior lab have shown no effect of these pheromones, at least in horses. I have seen some effects in cats and dogs with pheromones, so more studies are needed.

Category: Cribbing in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English   What is Cribbing? Cribbing is also called crib-biting, or wind-sucking. A horse typically uses a fixed, horizontal object (like a fence rail, or the edge of a feed tub), to crib. First, they grab hold of the object with their upper front teeth (incisors). Next, they press downward and pull back, arching their neck and drawing air into their upper esophagus. This makes a characteristic burping or grunting sound. A horse may use different objects for cribbing, depending on what is available. Often, they lick and mouth the object before cribbing on it. Some horses are able to crib without even grasping an object. The series of photos below show the sequence: It is common for a horse to crib repeatedly, in one session. Here is a video example of the same horse doing this while chewing grain:    Cribbing is a stereotypy. This means that the horse does it over and over, pretty much the same way every time, and that it doesn’t have any obvious purpose. It can become a compulsive behavior. This means that the horse wants to do it, even in different contexts than the one in which the cribbing started. For instance, some horses who started cribbing in a stall will continue to do it even at pasture. Cribbing used to be considered a “vice”, meaning an undesirable behavior, or even an unsoundness. This is changing as we learn more. Why Do Horses Crib? Cribbing hasn’t been observed in free-ranging wild or feral horses. It is seen in domestic horses and has also been seen in captive Przewalski horses. It used to be thought that horses learned to crib from watching other horses do it. It turns out that this is not typically how cribbing starts. However, cribbing is more likely to show up in related horses and in horses that are managed similarly. Thoroughbreds are the breed most likely to crib, followed by Warmbloods. Dressage and eventing horses have been found to be more likely to crib. Male horses, especially stallions, are more likely to crib than mares. Some of these associations may be because of the way these horses tend to be managed. For instance, Thoroughbreds and Warmbloods are often used for dressage and eventing, and housed individually in stalls, and stallions are often kept separate from other horses. These are management practices that increase the risk a horse will crib: Some horses who crib may have stomach ulcers or increased stomach acidity. Cribbing may decrease when these horses are treated with an antacid. However, the evidence for a cause and effect between stomach ulcers and cribbing is not clear. There is evidence that cribbing can relieve stress. Many of the management practices listed above are causes of stress in horses. Is Cribbing Unhealthy for Horses? Cribbing can cause abnormal and excessive tooth wear. It can also cause changes in muscling of the neck, and it can be associated with arthritis in structures of the jaw/throat (temporohyoid osteoarthritis). This photo shows abnormal and excessive wear of the upper incisors in the grey horse shown cribbing in the images above: Should Cribbing Be Stopped? It is very common for people to try to stop horses from cribbing. This is because of the concerns noted above, and also because cribbing horses can damage fences and other objects that they use. Stopping cribbing usually involves using: The motivation to crib is strong. One study found that it was as strong as the motivation to eat. When horses who crib are prevented from doing it: This suggests that these horses may crib as a coping or self-soothing behavior. Physically preventing them from cribbing does not fix the underlying causes. Instead, it may take away their means of coping with stress or anxiety. It is better to manage horses so that they are not motivated to begin cribbing in the first place, or to reduce their desire to crib, than to physically prevent them from cribbing. How to Reduce the Motivation to Crib Keeping the horse in a more natural setting can decrease the drive to crib. Horses naturally live in stable groups, in wide open spaces, and spend much of their time grazing. Ways to mimic a natural lifestyle include: Preventing Cribbing Because cribbing has a genetic component, one way to prevent it is to avoid breeding horses that crib. Prevention also involves keeping horses in more natural environments. It has been shown that minimizing stress around the time of weaning reduces the development of cribbing. If a horse begins to crib, it may be possible to reverse the cribbing by changing the horse’s management quickly (within a few weeks). If it is a longstanding behaviour, cribbing may decrease but not go away completely, even after management is improved.

Category: Horse Grimace Scale to Measure Pain
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English When we go into our physician complaining of pain, one of the first questions we are asked is to score the amount of pain we are experiencing on a scale of 1-10 so they can determine how bad we feel.  Unfortunately, veterinarians do not have that luxury and so we have to observe behaviors in animals that gives us an idea of how much pain our patients are experiencing. It has been shown that horses show facial expressions as signs of pain and researchers have used this information to develop a horse pain scale.  To determine which facial experessions are most related to pain and are most reliable, Dr. Emanuela Dalla Costa from Italy indicated that without an accurate tool to assess pain, we cannot identify when pain occurs, assess its severity or assess the effectiveness of anything we do to treat it.  She goes on to say that it is paramount to not only develop a tool to assess pain but to test its scientific validity in order to make sure what we are measuring is pain. The study involved 39 horses undergoing routine castration and they reviewed 126 photographs of the facial expressions of these horses before and after surgery, and scored them.  Then, they tried to determine which aspects of the facial expressions seemed most associated with pain.  The most reliable indicators of pain were stiffly backward ears, squinting of the eyes, tension above the eye area and strained chewing muscles.  Strained mouths and nostrils were less consistent indicators of pain.  The grimace scale was divided into facial action units and each unit received a value corresponding to the amount of pain.  Although this study only involved castration pain, it is believed to be helpful in determining pain from other syndromes as well.

Category: Recognizing Stress in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Now you may be thinking, "All my horses do is stand around and eat all day. How could they be stressed?" Well, historically horses were prey animals that lived in herds grazing for the majority of the day, so it is not surprising domesticated horses experience some degree of stress from modern day practices such as stall confinement. Dr. Camie Heleski from the University of Kentucky indicates at the Horse.com that as horse owners, we need to try to decrease this stress as much as possible. One method to determine the level of stress in horses is to measure stress hormones, one of which is cortisol and can be measured in blood, saliva or feces. Another method to examine stress is by monitoring body actions including rolling, standing, rearing, weaving and kicking as well as positioning of the tail, neck, ears, mouth and head. And just like people, horses are individuals because some situations might stress some horses but not others. One type of stress is feed related from restricting grazing and preventing access to hay throughout the day. Horses can experience gastrointestinal discomfort if deprived of food for more than two hours. Also, mares not allowed continuous access to feed or grazing are less fertile due to stress. Fecal cortisol levels also increase when horses are transported and increased cortisol levels can increase chances of respiratory infections occurring. Housing-related stress also occurs; when horses are housed individually with no contact with other horses, fecal cortisol levels increase. So it is important to realize that decreased feeding, isolation from other horses and transportation are all stresses that affect our horses, and knowing the cause of stress can help us to decrease it.

Category: Stallion-like Behavior in Geldings
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Most of you who have been around horses have probably heard the term proud cut.  This term is used when a horse that has been castrated still acts like a stud.  It was believed for many years that all of the tissue attached to the testicle, namely the epididymis, must be removed at the time of surgery.  If not, the epididymis produced enough hormones to cause the horses to still act like a stud.  However, it has been proven for over 30 years that this tissue does not produce any hormones and if the testicle is removed, the horse is correctly castrated.  Therefore, there is no such thing as a horse being proud cut. Although some have believed the adrenal gland produces enough male hormones to cause the behavior, this has also been shown to be incorrect.  Dr. Jim Schumacher indicates that most of the time, this behavior is due to an innate behavior during normal social interaction between horses rather than hormone production from another source.  However, it is possible a horse was castrated incorrectly or the horse had a testicle in the abdominal cavity that was not removed.  To determine if testicular tissue is present, a blood test called an HCG response test is used.  A blood sample is taken and then the hormone HCG is given to the horse and another blood sample is taken at 1 to 2 hours.  If the testosterone concentration increases, there is a 94% chance of testicular tissue remaining.  A one-time blood sample for estrone sulfate level is also 96% accurate in a horse over 3 years of age.  If testicular tissue is believed to exist, the best method of finding and removing it is with a laparoscope because the tissue is sometimes difficult to find without being able to look inside the abdomen.

Category: Conditioning Horses on Water Treadmills
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Due to their size and strength, horses commonly develop musculoskeletal injuries.  The treatment depends on the specific injury, but just like people with joint or muscle injuries, physical therapy and rehabilitation are part of the recovery process.  In fact, rehab after musculoskeletal surgery is about as important as the surgery itself in many human patients. Unfortunately, rehab in animals has been slower to occur as it is not easy to rehab a painful injury or surgery on an animal as you can’t tell them that they need to do a certain exercise to help them recover even if it’s uncomfortable.  However, in the last few years rehab has come a long way in pets as some veterinarians specialize in rehabilitation of injuries using various techniques, and some of these techniques are also used in horses.  One of the techniques used by veterinarians to rehab horses after injuries is a water treadmill, but the water treadmill is also used for conditioning horses. However, until recently, there was no research indicating the effectiveness of underwater treadmills on conditioning horses.  A team of vets from Calgary and Washington State Schools of Veterinary Medicine indicated they set up a study to evaluate fitness in horses trained on treadmills with and without water.  In water treadmills. the water was filled up to the level of the horse’s stifles, which added resistance and increased exercise intensity without increasing the speed of the treadmill belt or incline.  Results in horses training on the water treadmills revealed a 17% increase in average speed over horses trained on a treadmill without water. This occurred without having to increase the concussive forces on the horse’s musculoskeletal system, which minimizes injury.

Category: Cribbing / Wind Sucking Behavior and Colic in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English What is Cribbing? Cribbing or crib biting is a behavior in which the horse grabs onto a fixed object with the front teeth and pulls back while making a grunting noise. Windsucking is similar but the horse achieves the same position without grabbing a fixed object. Cribbing and windsucking have been reported to have detrimental effects on the horse's health such as causing dental abnormalities, stomach ulcers, weight loss, and even colic. In the past, it was believed that these horses sucked in air while cribbing and this ingestion of air led to colic. However, this was later shown to be incorrect because a small amount of air is actually ingested when these horses crib and suck wind.   Research It is now believed that horses that crib have altered brain and intestinal physiology that may cause them to colic. A recent survey in the U.K. indicated that the incidence of colic in horses that cribbed was high compared to the incidence of those that didn't. One study revealed that horses that cribbed were twice as likely to have a history of colic than those that did not crib. The survey also indicated that horses that experienced colic were more likely to be fed less hay and more grain and be stalled more than horses out at pasture. Also, it seemed at least in the U.K., that more horses experienced colic in the spring and fall than other times of the year. Other research also indicates that dietary management can play a role in cribbing.  Horses fed sweet feed were more likely to crib than those fed hay alone as were horses fed infrequently. What To Look Out For If you have a horse that cribs, realize that this horse has an increased risk of colic. If you are considering purchasing a horse, check out the front teeth. If they are worn down as they are in horses that crib, realize that this horse may have an increased incidence of colic.

Category: Equine Stereotypical Behaviors
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Stereotypic behaviors are repetitive, relatively unvaried behaviors that have no obvious purpose and interfere with the functioning of the horse. They are relatively common in horses compared to other domestic species and can affect the welfare, health, and value of your horse. Commonly referred to as stall or stable vices, stereotypic behaviors can be divided into two categories: oral and movement behavior. Oral stereotypies include cribbing, windsucking, wood chewing, licking, and tongue play. Movement stereotypies include stall walking, weaving, circling, pacing, head bobbing, and pawing. Stereotypies have been linked to a lack of turnout, lack of social contact, frustration, lack of foraging opportunities and stimulating environments, high concentrate diets, what kind of work the horse is trained for, or weaning too early. There is evidence that stereotypic behavior is inherited. These behaviors often begin when the horse is young. The reasons why your horse is showing stereotypic behavior are complicated. Behaviors may start as a coping mechanism under stressful conditions. When they occur only during stress (which for a stabled horse could be 24 hours/day) they are termed stereotypies. When the stress is gone but the horse continues the behavior, (i.e., a horse that begins walking circles in its stall but continues to do so in a large pasture) it can be called a compulsive disorder. Studies were done to see if the behavior is an obsession by seeing how hard a horse will work to perform the behavior. There seems to be some genetic reasons for stereotypic behavior. While having a sire or dam with a stereotypy does not mean your horse will develop the behavior, stereotypies are more common in related horses. Certain breeds, such as Thoroughbreds, Warmbloods, and Arabians, may be more likely to develop stereotypic behavior; however, this may be related to housing and diet as well. Stereotypic behavior is not considered transmissible. This means that if your horse watches another horse perform a stereotypic behavior, your horse is extremely unlikely to copy that behavior and develop the stereotypy. However, if the environment and management are poor, horses may be more likely to display these behaviors in general. Furthermore, the work your horse is trained for may also contribute to stereotypic behaviors. These are the reasons why some facilities appear to have a higher number of horses displaying these abnormal behaviors than others. If you suspect stereotypical behavior, your horse should be examined by your veterinarian. Some repetitive behaviors may be caused by a nervous disorder or other medical condition. Your horse may have separation anxiety. Certain stereotypies can put a horse’s health at risk. For instance, cribbing can cause abnormal wear of teeth and colic. Stomach ulcers are also common in cribbers, although whether this is cause or effect is uncertain. Stereotypies involving movement may cause orthopedic or repetitive strain injuries. Treatment of abnormal repetitive behaviors in horses centers around reducing the triggers of the behavior, such as improving the environment through suitable enrichment, reducing the amount of concentrate feed, and increasing roughage and daily turnout with compatible horses. Anti-anxiety medication may help horses with compulsive disorders. Punishment of these behaviors is not a good idea because it does not decrease the behavior in the long run and may add stress, contributing to the behavior. Devises like crib collars may stop the behavior while your horse is wearing it, reducing some health risks. However, devices do not address why your horse is displaying the behavior, foraging and stopping the horse from doing it can cause stress. Regardless of the cause of the behavior, repetitive behaviors in horses are difficult, if not impossible, to cure. Prevention is important and includes things like the natural weaning of foals, access to pasture (both for grazing and exercise), and social companionship. Breeding a horse that displays abnormal repetitive behavior is not recommended.

Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Today on the program we are going to talk about horse and human interaction and the effect eye contact has on behavior. The effect human eye contact has on animals has been studied in both dogs and sheep and it has been shown that eye contact from humans to dogs can be perceived by the dog as a threat. A recent study indicated human eye contact with sheep made the sheep nervous but did not induce fear in the sheep. The equine behavior lab at the University of Pennsylvania indicates the effect of human eye contact with horses is not well understood. If you listen to professional horse trainers, they all seem to have a different view of the effect of human eye contact with horses. Some report you should use soft eye contact when dealing with horses, meaning you can look at the horse but also keep a wide field of view. Other trainers indicate hard contact is preferred to establish your dominance over the herd. And then other trainers say you should avoid direct eye contact altogether as this will frighten the horse because it will make them think you are stalking them. Because there is no consistency in the recommendations, the group at Penn performed a study to determine if it was easier to catch horses in a pasture by making direct eye contact or not making direct eye contact. The result of the study indicated it really doesn't make any difference. Many of the horses used in this study were semi-wild ponies and catching them in the pasture was not easier or harder regardless of eye contact. Some of the horses could be caught and others could not, and eye contact had no effect so eye contact may not be a big factor in human-horse interaction.

Category: Social Interactions of Unfamiliar Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Horses are highly social animals who want to be around other horses. However, in many situations today, horses are kept by themselves for management reasons and ease of monitoring, feeding, and exercise regimens. Isolating horses, especially young horses, is not a good idea and can lead to problems. One study in the Journal of Applied Animals Behavior Science showed that depriving 2-year-old horses of social contact during a 6-month period resulted in increased aggression and less submissive behavior when mixed with other horses. A main concern about mixing horses is injuries that could occur during aggressive encounters, and this is avalid concern. When new horses are mixed, a stressful situation develops until the horses get acquainted and during this period, injuries can occur due to fighting. To determine if allowing limited exposure to horses would help prevent fighting when the horses were mixed, a study was performed that allowed 2-year-old horses to be placed beside each other in stalls before being released into a paddock. Results indicated that contact aggression was decreased if horses were introduced in side by side stalls where they could see each other but not touch each other. And biting between horses was reduced if the horses were only in these stalls for 5 minutes. Also, horses that did bite at each other were more likely to be aggressive toward each other when turned out in the pasture. For this reason, consider placing unfamiliar horses in stalls next to each other to monitor them before turning them out together and if biting is occurring, consider not turning them out together.

Category: Understanding a Horse’s Mind
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Robert Miller from California is one of the most respected and famous equine veterinarians in the world, and he recently spoke about understanding the horse’s mind.  In DVM 360, he says that all equine behaviors are related to the first behavior, and that is “flight is life.”  The horse’s survival behavior is flight as the horse has no weapons like horns and escapes predators by running away.  Humans, on the other hand, are predators and so we have to understand how the horse views the world to understand their mind.  The horse is the most perceptive of all domestic animals because if they are going to stay alive in the wild, they have to know when to run. Horses are very sensitive and can feel the rider’s slight change in position or weight shift, and they have 360 degrees of vision by turning their nose only about an inch, so they always know what is going on behind them.  However, their depth perception is not very good, so stepping up into a trailer or crossing a creek is scary until they are familiar with the process.  And while lightening quick responses allow them to stay alive, they can also cause injuries to humans that are not being careful and in the wrong place.  Dr. Miller also says that horses are the easiest domestic animal to desensitize to frightening by non-painful stimuli. If the training is done correctly, they can be trained to not be frightened by loud sounds or scary scenes.  They also learn quickly but they can learn the wrong thing just as quickly as the right thing; plus, they have a long-term memory so if something happens to them in a certain situation, they don’t forget it.  If their heads are down and they're smacking their lips, they are indicating submission and trust but if the head is up, they are thinking “I am afraid and need to run away.” The content of this site is owned by Veterinary Information Network (VIN®), and its reproduction and distribution may only be done withVIN®'s express permission.

Category: Vacation Stress in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Sometimes we take vacations and they feel more stressful than our regular day-to-day lives, and the same thing happens to horses.  A Spanish study recently looked at stress in horses that are off from work for a period or vacationing.  When working horses move to a new pasture for a lengthy break from work, they are initially stressed by the change of location.  After a few weeks, their stress levels tend to decrease and they can actually get some vacation time. It was believed that moving the horses from the working area would be the best method of giving them a break from the daily work schedule because a new area would have open spaces and no familiar working areas.  However, Dr. Manual Lopez-Bejar says that the new space implied changes in daily management and nutrition, plus less guided activity.  Mammals respond to environmental stress with a release of cortisol. The researchers checked resting cortisol levels in hair samples from eight Spanish stallions during a 3-week period off work.  The researchers indicated hair samples can provide an overview of long-term stress while short-term stress is determined by analyzing fecal and salivary samples.  During the working season, these stallions were kept in box stalls and for the rest period they were turned out to pasture with unlimited forage, no set routines, no work, were fed by different people, and were around different horses.  I can see how this would be initially stressful. There was a significant increase in hair cortisol to go along with the stress.  So, nearing the end of summer, some people consider giving their horses a rest.  Resting is good but remember that any changes should be slowly integrated rather than an abrupt change.

Category: Wrinkles above a Horse's Eye Indicate Mood
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English There is a link between the emotional state of horses and the type of wrinkles they get above their eyes. Dr. Sara Hintz from Switzerland researched the topic and at a conference presented her results indicating that wrinkles above a horse's eye are common but differ between individuals in number and shape of wrinkles. Dr. Hintz believed that horses with positive emotions would exhibit only a few eye wrinkles and those with negative emotions would have increased wrinkles. To test her theory, she used 15 stallions and one mare and exposed them all to positive situations, such as anticipating feeding and petting. She also exposed them to two negative situations, including food competition and the fear horses have when a plastic bag is being waved around.; The horses were exposed to the different stimuli for 60 seconds and over 500 photos were taken of the horse's eyes. In these photos, researchers scored the eyelid shape, noted the amount of white, number of wrinkles, the angle between a horizontal line through the eye, and the highest wrinkle. Although results indicated there was no difference in the number of wrinkles and eyelid shape, she did see more eye whites and a sharper wrinkle angle during positive situations compared to the negative situations She explained that the more relaxed the underlying muscle of the eyelids are, the narrower the angle would be. Therefore it seems possible that some characteristics of eye wrinkle expression could be used to indicate a horse's emotional state. Assessing animals' emotional states is difficult and involves lengthy and sometimes invasive procedures, including blood testing. Any clues to the mood of horses that can be gained by rapid visual inspection may be helpful to the horses and their handlers.

Category: Introducing New Experiences
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Dr. Temple Grandin is an animal behavior specialist with the Department of Animal Science at Colorado State. She indicated in Equine Veterinarian that it is critically important to make a horse's first experience with anything new a positive experience. If a first experience at entering a trailer or entering a horse stock is frightening, it may be difficult to get the horse to go back in the same area. For this reason, it is important to go very slow when introducing horses to new experiences and after they have accomplished the goal, give them a food treat. Certainly if you are trying to introduce a horse to a new area, make sure the footing is good because if the horse slips and falls, it is very frightening and the horse will associate the area with fear. And these fearful memories last a long time, sometimes forever. It has been shown that new objects presented to a horse can be non-frightening if the animal is allowed to approach the object voluntarily. Grandin gives the example of a large umbrella. If you pull out an umbrella it will startle the horse but if you place the umbrella in the arena and allow the horse to approach it naturally, it will do so and not be afraid. For example, if you have a horse that is fearful of flags, place flags around the perimeter of the arena and then let the horse approach them voluntarily rather than being surprised by them. A horse's memory is specific as he may be afraid of black hats but okay with white hats so the key is introduce all things slowly and give a treat when the task is accomplished.

Category: Positive Reinforcement Training for Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Classic horse training and behavior modification involve the use of negative reinforcement, which is the application of pressure that is released when your horse moves away from it. This works well because horses naturally move away from pressure. The concern is that if pressure is not released as soon as the horse responds, the horse won't understand that the response was correct. After a while, your horse can become dulled to the cues. Horses like this are often referred to as stubborn. Sometimes the amount of pressure applied is excessive and is perceived as punishment, which can trigger fear. Recently there has been a movement toward using positive reinforcement training methods for horses. This technique aims to capture the desired behavior and reward it so that the horse learns to repeat it. Positive reinforcement is popular among dog trainers but is also used in zoos and with marine mammals. Positive reinforcement has been shown across species to be a very effective strategy for training new behaviors. Animals with a history of positive reinforcement training are more likely to try new things, and to be better and more willing learners. Positive reinforcement can be used to train simple groundwork such as standing to be groomed, tacked and mounted, coming when called, or picking up feet. It can also be used to create positive emotional experiences with otherwise fearful stimuli such as a trailer. Positive reinforcement can be used under saddle as well, particularly with the use of a marker word. Step One Step Two Step Three   Positive Reinforcement Training from the Saddle Purely positive reinforcement training during riding is difficult to accomplish.  Since most of our cues with horses involve touch and pressure from legs, hands, and seats, there is an inherent part of negative reinforcement training that comes with riding. Especially in those disciplines where verbal cues are not allowed in the show ring. Certain specific tasks can be accomplished with a helper and a target stick such as walking over, under, or through obstacles or helping to teach specific patterns. Your horse will then associate the learning of these exercises with something rewarding. In general, cues are taught by gently applying the signal. When your horse responds, remove the signal, and mark the behavior. In the beginning, rewards should come consistently with each performance of the behavior. Over time, you can vary the number of repetitions between treats.    Many horse owners don’t like using food to train their horses. Sometimes this stems from owners who believe the horse should listen to cues out of respect or because they have been previously trained, and their owners feel the horse should know how to behave. Instead, positive reinforcement training should be considered a method of developing a partnership between you and your horse. Some horses may have dietary restrictions due to a medical condition such as laminitis or Cushings, or perhaps the owners are concerned about obesity. Food rewards need not be large or rich in sugars or calories but for most horses, food is the best and most convenient reward. If food absolutely cannot be used, a scratch on the withers area may be the next best thing.

Category: Safe Horse Handling
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English A trained veterinary technician or assistant should hold your horse for the veterinarian.  However, sometimes this is impossible during emergency situations, and some vets do not have technicians available to help.  The veterinarian has to trust you to hold the horse. This is a lot of responsibility so if you do not feel comfortable, tell the veterinarian. When holding the horse, it’s much safer to stand on the same side as the vet so the horse can move away from both of you if necessary.  Never stand directly in front of a horse as this is just as dangerous as standing directly behind one.  Nor should you ever trust a tranquilizer; even though the horse may seem very sedated, he can still react to pain or other stimulus and injure you severely.  People tend to relax around a sedated horse and let their guard down because they assume the horse will not move.  However, I have seen horses so sedated they could barely stand and yet blow up and cause severe injury.  Stay awake if your vet is working on a sedated horse!  Also, don’t surprise a horse without letting him know you are in the area, especially if he is sedated.  You can do this by talking to the horse before touching and letting him know you are near him.  Another tip is to stay as calm as possible in an emergency situation.  The horse is afraid and thus unpredictable so it is important for the handler to be as calm as possible.  Being calm is not easy, but it can help keep your horse calm and make treatment easier for everyone.

Category: Treating the Untouchable Horse
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English Do you have a horse who hates to be touched? Dr. Stacey Tarr from Colorado presented a paper at the AAEP convention on techniques to deal with untouchable horses. All veterinarians are faced with treating them from time to time, but Dr. Tarr indicates it is common in her area. She said there are many methods to deal with these horses but the key is to try to do everything safely for the horse and humans. She uses several methods, including placing a calm horse in with the untouchable wild horse and this seems to sometimes calm the wild horse. The calm horse can also act as a shield to prevent human injury when trying to inject the wild horse. Roping these horses may be required but is not preferable because this further excites the horse. Sometimes a saddled horse can help gently pen the untouchable horse for an injection. All of these horses have to be sedated and most have to be anesthetized to examine and treat them. Most sedatives used in horses block adrenaline to calm the horse, and when a horse is excited, it requires a higher dose of sedation, sometimes even double the amount normally used. This higher dose can be dangerous for the horse and even a double dose may not be effective in sedating an excited wild horse. Also, if the horse is injured and treatment is required for several days, it is almost impossible to treat these horses correctly because you cannot sedate and anesthetize the horse every day. Lastly, the expense of treating a wild horse is going to be much more than a normal horse due to your veterinarian's time involved and increased amount of drugs used. So if you have a horse that is uncontrollable and not at least halter broke, please start working with your horse today. It will save you money and possibly your horse's life.

Category: Twitch Use in Horses
Sorry, something went wrong and the translator is not available. Sorry, something went wrong with the translation request. Translating Return to English One of the most common instruments veterinarians use in equine practice is a nose twitch.  For those of you unfamiliar with horses, a twitch is a clamp, piece of rope or chain on a handle that applies pressure to the end of the horse’s nose.  The twitch has been used for thousands of years and many thought it simply redirected the pain of a procedure such as an injection from the sight of the actual procedure to the nose.  However, it has been shown using the twitch actually releases natural chemicals called endorphins inside the horse’s body, which have a sedative and pain-relieving effect on the horse.  Dr. Sue McDonnell at the University of Pennsylvania Equine Behavior Lab says it takes 3-5 minutes after applying the twitch for the endorphin levels to rise and the pain relieving and sedative effects to take effect.  Many of us get in a hurry and apply the twitch and then immediately start to work when it might be better to wait a few minutes for the chemicals released by the horse’s body to take effect. The second concern is the length of time the twitch is effective in pain relief and Dr. McDonnell indicates the twitch is usually effective for 12-15 minutes and then should be removed.  The twitch can be reapplied after 15 minutes and should be effective but it may not be as effective as the first application.  The effectiveness of a twitch depends on the horse and circumstances involved.  If the horse is already excited the twitch is used, the effect will not be as great.  If the twitch is applied skillfully and the horse remains calm, the sedative effect will be much greater.  So, it turns out a twitch actually causes sedation and pain relief and is not just something to take the horse’s mind off of another procedure.
